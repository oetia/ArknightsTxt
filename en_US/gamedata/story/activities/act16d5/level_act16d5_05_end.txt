Villager:
Stay away! Get back!

Villager:
It—it bit off my hand—ha, haha—why can't I feel any pain at all, why—

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Villager:
Eek—stay away!

Lava:
Are you okay?!

Villager:
Why did you only just come?! Why did nobody sound the bell?! Where'd the vigilant monk go?!

Villager:
You know we trusted you, so we did what you said! Why! Why did my husband have to die?! How can you make up for that?! How?!

Lava:
We'll talk when we're safe.

Little Girl:
Waaahhh—mama, mama! Give my mama back!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Mr. Nothing:
Whoa, there! Even less close for comfort!

Little Girl:
M-Mister, mama, mama—

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Mr. Nothing:
Let's ignore this fellow for now! There seems be something disastrous afoot outside! Young lady, hold on tight, we're going to slip out of here!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa—! Gkhaa!

Mr. Nothing:
Another one?!

Lava:
I can't—I can't deal with this!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa—!

Ink Spirit:
Gkh!

Lava:
Where the hell did they all come from?!

Lava:
Damnit, there's no way I can hold back this many—

Ink Spirit:
Gkh...?

Saga:
Though they may figures in a painting, there is no need to slaughter them all... observing such a scene only serves to inspire outbursts of sorrow.

Saga:
Lava, I am here to watch this place. Thou would best hurry to take others to refuge.

Lava:
You...

Saga:
Worry not for me. I have traveled many times here. I have had all manner of thought on the future, anxieties indeterminate—

Saga:
—but for that in front of me, I have never been one moment nor fraction irresolute.

Saga:
Leave this to me.

Lava:
Alright. Keep going east. When you're done, find me and we'll converge.

Saga:
Understood!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!!

Saga:
I am here! None shall come forward!

Ink Spirit:
?!

Saga:
Those who pass this line—shall be cut down.

Little Girl:
Waaahhh—

Mr. Nothing:
Ow, ow! My dear young lady! Might you be able to stop pulling on my hair!

Little Girl:
Mamaaa—mamaaaa—

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Mr. Nothing:
These cretins only keep gkh-gkh-gkhing! How can things so bent on chasing you not spit out a human word or two?!

Ink Spirit:
Gkh...

Ink Spirit:
...DON'T... RUN...

Mr. Nothing:
Good heavens, I was only joking! You need not! You absolutely need not—!

Little Girl:
*whimper* Mister, l—look in front!

Mr. Nothing:
Eh?

Villager:
Yaaagh!

Villager:
A—Are you that fortune-teller...? Where are the other two heroes?

Villager:
Behind you, behind you!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Villager:
Why did you bring it over here!? Think of something—think of something!

Mr. Nothing:
What can I possibly think of?!

Villager:
Lead them away from here, away!

Mr. Nothing:
I... I'm...

Little Girl:
*whimper* Waaahhhh, mama, mama—

Mr. Nothing:
......

Villager:
Oh, just stop crying! Stop! Stop crying, girl!

Villager:
Agh! Those things are looking at us! Get out of here, get out of—

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaaaaaagh!

Villager:
Huh...?

Villager:
Y-You used your fan?

Mr. Nothing:
Hide yourselves further away.

Ink Spirit:
Gkhao? Gkhaa—

Villager:
In one move...?!

Ink Spirit:
Ao!?

Villager:
A-Amazing...

Mr. Nothing:
......

Mr. Nothing:
Ow-Owie, it hurts so much, it hurts so much—just what are these things, and how can they look so soft, yet be so hard when striking them?

Mr. Nothing:
Oh, stop goggling at me. The proverb puts it well; even a cornered burdenbeast will bite. Here, we'd best just hurry on our way!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhao...

Mr. Nothing:
?!

Kroos:
Man alive, Nothing, your kickboxing work's not bad, but you've never done a rescue business like this, eh?

Kroos:
Deal with the enemies in front of you without checking movement on your whole perimeter, and sooner or later you'll give yourself grief.

Mr. Nothing:
Ah, ahahah... that was quite dangerous just now! My apologies for the grief I gave you, benefactor. Only thanks to you am I safe and sound.

Kroos:
Alright, quick, go and get everyone left into shelter.

Mr. Nothing:
Er, what about you, benefactor?

Kroos:
Me? Don't you mind, I walk light as a feather. They won't ever notice me.

Mr. Nothing:
(Can the single skill of light-footedness really explain that?!)

Kroos:
And then... how do we cut down these Ink Spirit numbers fast...?

Villager:
Eyaah! Wh—what's that fire in the garden?

Saga:
Hoo! This blaze soaring skyward makes quite a spectacle!

Saga:
Ho? Could it be that the name 'Lava' held this exact meaning?

Lava:
......

Kroos:
Lavaaa.

Lava:
Confirm the extent of all enemy scatter in the vicinity for me.

Kroos:
This big of an arena?

Lava:
I'm worried about the surrounding buildings getting caught up, so I've been sort of keeping my Arts tied down...

Lava:
...but there's just too many enemies. If we keep dragging this out, I'm concerned casualties are going to end up tough to estimate.

Kroos:
Roger. Special times, special methods, right.

Kroos:
I'll find a high vantage point. You focus on casting.

Kroos:
I'll help you sort all the ones outside your Arts range. I guarantee I'm not gonna miss a single one.

Lava:
Good.

Lava:
I'll submit the mission report afterwards... after all, it's not just the Infected that Rhodes Island helps.

Kroos:
Infected...?

Lava:
What's up?

Kroos:
Huh... nothing, actually. By the way, Lava.

Kroos:
You seen Mr. Umbrella-Boiler anywhere?
