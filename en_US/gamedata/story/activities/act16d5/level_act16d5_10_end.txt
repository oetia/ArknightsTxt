Nian:
You're extremely bad-tempered, you don't ever talk, you get mad all of a sudden, and your attitude is completely terrible. No wonder I, your own sister, am the only one willing to take care of you.

Dusk:
......

Nian:
You don't get along with that silly wordsmith, because you two don't accept that both word and art rose from the same source. You don't get along with me, because you don't wanna try hotpot that's even a little bit spicy—

Nian:
*sigh*, if you ever come up with those silly dishes like Metal Crab ice cream pot again, I really won't have a clue what to do with you.

Dusk:
Enough talk.

Dusk:
I'm guessing you're trying to drag this out by spewing nonsense because you're exhausted already?

Nian:
...Eh, you haven't gotten even a bit of shut-eye all these years?

Dusk:
......

Nian:
Pulling an all-nighter may help you keep a clear head better than losing a couple hours of sleep, but the fatigue adds up and wears you out.

Nian:
Oh, I get it. You're scared.

Dusk:
Grr...

Nian:
You know yourself better than anyone. And you know you're part of the painting, too. And you're afraid you'll cease to exist when you wake up.

Dusk:
Shut up!

Nian:
Oh, calm down.

Nian:
We all need to face the truth about ourselves. That's not something we can run from.

Dusk:
Tsk.

Dusk:
I didn't know you could get this sentimental. Perhaps you got a little too much sleep?

Nian:
By the time 'we' wake up and gaze upon this world, both you and I as we exist right now will disappear, without a trace.

Nian:
Not only that, 'we' will set this whole world ablaze with our flames of rage. The humiliation and resentment inside me will burn as well, up until the moment 'our' ties are cut.

Nian:
And I won't be particularly happy about that.

Dusk:
...You'll resist it?

Dusk:
Nonsense. How will you, a mere part of the body, take on the whole?

Nian:
Eh, I think I used that analogy before.

Dusk:
Enough of your smooth talk. We don't have time—

Nian:
Yeah, I know. I'm not the only one who thinks this way. Before 'we'—Actually, I guess since we've broken it off with those lunatics, it's not really 'we' anymore—

Nian:
—Before 'it' awakens, we need to be fully prepared. We have to be able to do this, no matter what kind of strength we need to borrow.

Nian:
And we aren't doing this for anything. It's only for ourselves and the things we love.

Nian:
Also, I'm sure you noticed... Some of our siblings are on our side, some don't care, and there are some... who are absolute nut jobs.

Dusk:
...Impossible.

Nian:
Really? Don't you actually have a few ideas about who those nut jobs are?

Dusk:
They're all close to the True Lung. What chance do they... No... That's not right...

Nian:
What are you doing, being more confused than I am? Just take a look back at our long history. How many times have you seen so much as a peep out of those guys?

Nian:
These days, even the big shots who like to throw their weight around send their Messengers to lounge in that little temple's side hall... It's not gonna fool me, and it's not gonna fool anyone.

Nian:
Shackles can't keep you down now, can they? If not, then what makes you think anything can keep the others down?

Dusk:
......

Nian:
Anyway, we really don't have much time left. It doesn't matter who drove us into this corner, there's just no time.

Nian:
Do you remember the last time you had a good night's sleep?

Nian:
Oh, man, that was close. You really don't think much of your art, do you? You painted these yourself! And to think you were just lecturing me about that.

Dusk:
Enough nonsense.

Nian:
Guessing you're not gonna admit it?

Dusk:
...Not necessarily. What you just said is worth giving a little thought to.

Dusk:
But what does any of that have to do with the 'Rhodes Island' place? What does that have to do with what it is you want to accomplish?

Nian:
You could go check it out yourself. It's a great place.

Dusk:
...A fair amount of us have already come to accept this fate.

Dusk:
We'll disappear, and it will awaken. We will become I anew, before we all cease to exist as the destruction of the great Yan cities rings in the air.

Dusk:
Is there any point in that...?

Nian:
That's the answer you came up with after all these years? A little too sappy, don't you think? What happened to the haughty, arrogant Dusk I remember?

Dusk:
......

Nian:
Ah, whatever. If this goes on, we'll run out of paintings to mess up. Hmph—

Dusk:
Wait, not again—

Nian:
Oh, check this out. This is top of the line. It's eight feet wide, three-and-a-half tall, ignited with materials never before seen in Terra—My beloved two-step firecracker!

Dusk:
...Tch.

Nian:
Yo, we're back!

Lava:
Nian!

Mr. Nothing:
My benefactor, there seems to be a burnt smell lingering in the air...

Kroos:
...Nian's winking at us. We should probably stay away. Nothing good comes of that.

Dusk:
......

Nian:
Well, I've said all there is to say. I tried to reason with you, even. What do you think?

Dusk:
......

Dusk:
I told you right from the start.

Nian:
What good does locking yourself away in the paintings do anyway?

Nian:
Come with me to Rhodes Island. It'll be just as fun there. Let's get the other guys and, hey, we can have a little family reunion over at Rhodes.

Nian:
Then we can really suss out our sisterly issues, along with the rest.

Dusk:
Rhodes Island... What does that place have that's worth your persistence?

Dusk:
And you want to bring everyone there? Ha, that's more absurd than us declaring war on Yan right now.

Nian:
If you won't come willingly, I can't just stand here and watch you lose your mind and disappear without a peep.

Dusk:
That's your problem.

Nian:
Ugh, don't tell me we're gonna have to fight this one out?

Dusk:
That's your problem too. Dueling is incredibly boring, and, as a way to resolve differences, it went out of fashion centuries ago.

Dusk:
...But I will say that you've really gotten under my skin today.

Nian:
Heh.

Nian:
Lava?

Lava:
Uhh?

Nian:
Stay away. Get off the mountain and go somewhere else.

Nian:
What's about to go down, there's no room for you guys to interfere—

Saga:
Hm? Where am I...?

Saga:
—Ohh? Have I returned already?

Saga:
Hm? Is that not Lava? Kroos and Mr. Nothing, too.

Saga:
Hoh, my good sir—And who might this be? Oh, art thou perchance the master's sister? My, my, 'tis a pleasure to meet thee!

Saga:
My name is Saga, a wandering monk from the far lands of Higashi!

Nian:
Hah... This is getting interesting.

Saga:
Uh, why the suspicious stare, may I ask? Oh, mayhaps there is rice on my face...?

Dusk:
...You...

Nian:
Rice?

Saga:
I had a magnificent vegetarian feast with many a great number of myself. Verily, the taste brought me back. It hath left me the most satisfied!

Dusk:
How did you...?

Saga:
Beg pardon?

Dusk:
How did you... leave my scroll?

Saga:
I am afraid I know not how. I merely returned.

Saga:
All I recall is that the first person whom I met is me as I am now, and the last person whom I met is also me as I am right now. Everything that occurred between is but a faint haze, likely my random thoughts.

Saga:
I walked alongside myself, the me in the painting, sharing conversations unto today, and we walked from Yan all the way back to the monastery.

Saga:
The moment I swung the door open and entered, I remembered my head priest's painting and the words he spoke as he lamented—

Dusk:
Lamented?

Saga:
He said, 'The mountains are but mountains, and the water is yet water.'

Dusk:
——

Saga:
Just then, I noticed there was but a mirror in front of me. In the blink of mine eye, I found myself here.

Saga:
One final note, I must admit that the other me, having become a heavy gambler, did rather frighten me. It seems I must not take up gambling.

Dusk:
Heh, no wonder. Looks like your master reasoned with you just as much as I did, that little punk of a monk...

Dusk:
He never saw in the scroll anything he saw in life... so it was just mountains and waters to him, hmph.

Nian:
Don't be such a sore loser, my little sister. You're embarrassing yourself.

Dusk:
I...

Dusk:
You were woken twice, but your perceptiveness and reasoning... is rather beyond my expectations.

Nian:
Remember how we made a bet a long, long, loooong time ago?

Dusk:
Hmph...

Nian:
You lost.

Nian:
Oh, don't even try to deny it. I know there's way more than one person who made it through the boundaries of your imagination. I will let the prior ones slide, but this happened right before my eyes.

Dusk:
You can stop blowing your own horn just because you're right. It'll be the end of you one day.

Nian:
Remember what I said. There are always ways to turn things around.

Dusk:
Turn things around...

Dusk:
Fine. Very well... You won.

Dusk:
There's no point in making a stand over this... I'll just stand by and see how far you can take it.

Nian:
I guarantee you're in for a surprise, my good little sister.

Dusk:
Hmph.

Nian:
Lava, nice work.

Lava:
Uh, your sister doesn't seem very happy. Should we just leave her alone?

Nian:
Oh, she's fine... She's locked herself away in the paintings for years. Having to deal with this many people is probably asking too much from her right now.

Nian:
Just pretend she's got some anxiety disorder, or that she's shy.

Nian:
Oh, if you're trying to strike up a conversation, you're just gonna get yelled up, Nothing bro. You don't want to bring that on yourself.

Mr. Nothing:
A-Alright.

Kroos:
...So, I guess that wraps up the mission?

Lava:
How did you get here anyway...?

Nian:
I've got my ways...

Lava:
What's our next step?

Nian:
Find ourselves a car or something and head back to Rhodes Island?

Nian:
Might as well take a few stops on the way to get grub. Make it a fun road trip.

Nian:
Kuo-wu is known for its fine, exquisite food. If you ask me, though, I think they're tasteless and boring—

Dusk:
—Blasphemy. You'll find no finer delicacy than the scalebass here toward the end of autumn. They are plump and delicious, the perfect complement to the green mountains and rivers around us.

Nian:
...Oh, scalebass is fine, but it's no match for a hotpot paired with booze.

Dusk:
Heh, I should have the kid show you how wrong you are. The broad variety of Yan cuisine will open your eyes.

Dusk:
Even hotpot is a subject of study and debate. Given how... quick with the tongue you are, I can't imagine you being an expert on the subject.

Nian:
Oh, open my eyes? That's a bit rich, coming from someone who eats nothing but ink.

Dusk:
Please, I wouldn't dare to lecture anyone on cuisine. Look at what you are wearing, though. It reminds me of freshly planted chilies.

Dusk:
......

Nian:
......

Lava:
H-Hey, let's stop it, okay? And here I thought you two finally calmed down! Kroos, help me out here.

Kroos:
I just looked up the route back. We're gonna hit seventeen restaurants well-known for their local specialties. This will do, right?

Lava:
......

Nian:
Yeah, I suppose it'll work.

Dusk:
...Hmph.

Mr. Nothing:
My benefactors! My benefactors! Uh, I have something I would like to mention.

Lava:
What is it now? You're acting so weird, it's freaking me out...

Mr. Nothing:
Well, you see, I was hoping to make my way to Lungmen to find myself a job, but it appears you are all employed by this... 'Rhodes Island.' Is this island maybe hiring?

Mr. Nothing:
I can do anything! I am healthy and hale, quite ripped even! And I most certainly am not afraid of the Infected! I guarantee you'll get your money's worth!

Lava:
Uh... you could come with us and take the exams, but I can't really promise you anything...

Mr. Nothing:
Very well, then please allow me to accompany you on your journey!

Lava:
This is turning into a real party.

Saga:
Master.

Dusk:
Yes?

Saga:
I shall never forget the time I spent within thy scrolls.

Dusk:
You needn't remember it.

Saga:
I am afraid these memories will stay with me for the rest of my life. Unlike thee, life is short for me.

Dusk:
You have my pity.

Dusk:
How's your master now...?

Saga:
My head priest yet lives. Though he is already a century and a score in age, thou wilt find him quite hale and healthy.

Dusk:
Right.

Dusk:
So you're going with them?

Saga:
No, I am afraid not... I wish to continue my travels far and wide, leaving Yan behind.

Saga:
I have a dream.

Saga:
Be that as it may, Lava has been a kind friend. Surely, this Rhodes Island must be a place of many fascinations. Should we have the chance, I wish to pay it a visit.

Saga:
I am afraid I know not when that will be, however.

Dusk:
...Heh. Isn't that nice? You guys have that privilege now.

Saga:
Why, I quite envy thee instead, Master Dusk. Thou need not take a step outside to enjoy the fine landscapes even thousands of miles away.

Dusk:
If you've seen as many mountains as I have, life isn't going to be that much more interesting, no matter how many thousands of miles you travel.

Dusk:
Crude mounts utmost risen.

Dusk:
If you ever meet him again, tell him: this one extra stroke wasn't bad.

Lava:
Mr. Nothing, there's been a car tailing us for a while, right?

Lava:
Looks like they're here for you. Need any help?

Mr. Nothing:
I won't trouble you so... Allow me to take care of this myself.

Kroos:
What happened to the promise to your master?

Mr. Nothing:
Why, I needn't use the fan to take care of these hooligans!

Mr. Nothing:
If they dare do evil beyond the city gates under broad daylight, then there truly is no law and order left in this world! I'll teach them a lesson today—

Lava:
Look, there's two more cars now.

Kroos:
Some of them have weapons too. Looks like they're bent on making a ruckus.

Mr. Nothing:
......

Mr. Nothing:
...M-My benefactors?

Lava:
*Sigh*.

Lava:
Well, if they mean us harm... Let's do this.
