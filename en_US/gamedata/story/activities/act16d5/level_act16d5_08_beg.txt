Ink Spirit:
Guh...

Dawn:
Ink Spirits. Ink... Spirit. What a beautiful name.

Dawn:
Saga is such an bright girl.

Dawn:
Again and again, she protects the things she knows can't be damaged. I wonder if that means they will grow sick of this pointless exercise and give up on that righteousness one of these days?

Dawn:
I suppose she will. After all, if you can restore broken porcelain, then it's not going to be much of a heartbreak at all to see it shatter into pieces.

Dawn:
You might even come to enjoy the feeling of breaking it.

Ink Spirit:
...Gaa?

Dawn:
But do we have to go that far...? Human nature is no match for these trials and tribulations.

Ink Spirit:
...Goh...

Dawn:
Are you watching, Dusk?

Dawn:
You are such a meanie... I only hope don't mind what I have planned.

Lava:
—Hff!

Mr. Nothing:
My benefactors, we've done it at last!

Mr. Nothing:
Forgive me for throwing cold water, but with no end in sight to our daily scuffles with the monsters, surely you agree with me our search for the way out is making hardly any progress?

Lava:
Saga said she'd come up with something.

Mr. Nothing:
And so we will take on the Ink Spirits here day after day? This hardly feels like the best use of our time...

Lava:
It's no big deal to me.

Lava:
Just think of it as a way to hone our techniques.

Kroos:
—Lava, mate.

Lava:
Hmm? What's up?

Kroos:
......

Lava:
Go on?

Kroos:
The Arts you used back there looked just a little bit dangerous.

Lava:
I... Uh...?

Kroos:
See? You burned down quite a few stores.

Kroos:
And you, Nothing, mate.

Kroos:
You pretended you didn't see that small Ink Spirit rush toward town, did you?

Mr. Nothing:
I thought you would have no trouble taking care of it.

Kroos:
No, you thought, 'If something goes wrong, everything will just go back to the way it was tomorrow.'

Mr. Nothing:
......

Mr. Nothing:
I... I can't deny I did... I know what you mean, but...

Kroos:
Today's the seventh day.

Kroos:
I'm not trying to give you a hard time. When you pointlessly protect the same objectives day after day, you're bound to feel that way sooner or later.

Kroos:
Remember Rim Billiton, though... Don't ever forget what that bloody month taught us.

Kroos:
War can wear you down mentally, so we need to be alert.

Lava:
Kroos...

Kroos:
Sorry... Mate, you know that I've always...

Lava:
It's okay. I understand.

Lava:
We'll be fine. We'll get out of here and make it back to Rhodes Island in one piece.

Kroos:
......

Kroos:
Alright~ Be sure to treat me to some Columbian coffee once we're back.

Lava:
Yeah.

Lava:
Is Saga still in the room?

Mr. Nothing:
I stole a glance before leaving this morning. It has been seven days since she started meditating... My benefactor, if we die of starvation or thirst in this painting, do you suppose that... we might truly die?

Lava:
No idea. All Saga said before she shut herself in was something like, 'Leave it to me...'

Lava:
She's the one who understands most what's going on in the painting. We don't have any other choice, or are you volunteering to take a stroll inside the other scrolls, just like what she's doing?

Mr. Nothing:
No, no, no. I'm hardly as determined as the master. I'm afraid I would find myself distracted and never able to return.

Lava:
There just isn't much we can do for her until something happens on her end.

Dawn:
So this is where you've been.

Lava:
Dawn? What's the matter?

Dawn:
I wanted to remind you to never stray from your true conscience.

Dawn:
I once told Saga, 'When deceit is taken for truth, the truth is yet unreal. When naught is taken for aught, there is yet but nil.'

Dawn:
Right, where is she?

Lava:
She's been meditating in the room for days.

Dawn:
I see. She wants to wake up.

Dawn:
There have been very few people who managed to wake up from the scroll on their own volition. Actually, I should say there has never been anyone who has managed to do it.

Dawn:
But... maybe.

Dawn:
Ms. Lava, have you heard of 'firecrackers?'

Dawn:
It's a time-honored tradition in Yan. As you can imagine, it was at first—

Lava:
—For warding off ancient monsters?

Dawn:
Oh... I thought you were born outside of Yan? You know your Yan traditions well.

Lava:
Well, let's just say I've got a friend...

Kroos:
Right, now I remember...

Lava:
Please don't remember.

Kroos:
This is straight out of 'Ancient Forge,' isn't it? I remember something about Nian being scared of firecrackers. The Dark Devastator in the end used cannons as well—

Lava:
—Aahhhh, I can't hear you!

Lava:
Dawn! What do firecrackers have to do with this situation?!

Dawn:
Hm? Oh... I was going to say the Ink Spirits are actually scared of firecrackers.

Dawn:
If we hang some firecrackers up at the village's entrance, they will naturally stay away.

Lava:
Really?!

Mr. Nothing:
Wow, what a lifesaver! My back has been hurting me the past day and a half! At last, I can take the day off from looking for monsters!

Mr. Nothing:
Now, without further ado, let us take to the market—

Dawn:
You won't find them in the market.

Mr. Nothing:
—Quite right. How do we procure some, then?

Dawn:
Well, there is a way...

Dawn:
Do you know why firecrackers are called as such?

Mr. Nothing:
Because the earliest Yan people thought to commemorate their fallen liege's exploits by setting bamboo on fire, and memorialize the great war with its crackling sounds.

Kroos:
You know your stuff.

Mr. Nothing:
Haha, I'm merely well-read on the subject.

Dawn:
There you have it.

Dawn:
Let's give them a surprise unlike any other.

Dawn:
This one will do?

Mr. Nothing:
What a fine bamboo tree. Would be a waste to cut it down!

Dawn:
It will grow anew tomorrow.

Mr. Nothing:
Showing no mercy to the flora, are we...?

Lava:
I'm back! Is this enough?

Dawn:
The more the better.

Kroos:
The Umbrella-Boiler is such a nice guy. He gave us all this bamboo for nothing.

Dawn:
If you're worried about taking the bamboo, I'll pay the storyteller a visit and give him our thanks. No one ever comes back to my pawn shop for their items. I could just give him everything as a sign of our gratitude.

Lava:
Are you sure about that?

Dawn:
It will all be mine again tomorrow.

Kroos:
Hm, I've seen firewood burn and crackle up pretty good, but does bamboo do that too?

Dawn:
Supposedly, wet bamboo after the rain gives the most thunderous pops. The only problem is it never rains here.

Dawn:
Right, just like this... Make a kind of stove with the mud...

Dawn:
Now, as for the fire—

Lava:
—Let me try.

Dawn:
Be careful with the heat. It's a bit more finicky than it seems.

Lava:
I-I'll try my best...

Mr. Nothing:
My benefactor! They are here!

Dawn:
Now!

Lava:
Mph—

Ink Spirit:
Gkh... gkhaa—?!

Mr. Nothing:
We did it! They're dazed!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa—!!

Mr. Nothing:
They ran? Are they truly afraid of it?

Kroos:
Did it really work...? Why is that...?

Lava:
We'll have to ask Nian—

Storyteller:
...Nian?
