Lava:
What are... these things? Infected creatures?

Kroos:
Haven't noticed any signs of infection, though... and you say creatures, but whenever I shoot them, they just turn into black stains and disappear.

Lava:
Some kind of Arts?

Kroos:
Could be.

Lava:
This can't go on. There's too many of them... we need to find the source.

Lava:
Which direction did they enter the village from?

Kroos:
Horizon's getting darker, Lava.

Lava:
I know.

Kroos:
Still gonna chase 'em?

Kroos:
We're still not sure how we even got here... things are a little weird. I'm not a fan of getting in too deep right now.

Kroos:
Even if it's a lead, we don't need to rush that hard.

Lava:
......

Mr. Nothing:
B-Benefactors!

Lava:
Uh, why'd you come with?

Mr. Nothing:
What nonsense! How could I abandon my benefactors and flee alone?

Lava:
Do you know what those things are?

Mr. Nothing:
Iâ€”I've never seen them before either... Look at how my legs are trembling...

Lava:
They're not some kind of... Yan specialty, right?

Mr. Nothing:
As if they could be! If this gallery of oddities were crawling all the lands, they would've long since broken national news!

Lava:
Kroos, Mr. Nothing, listen to me.

Lava:
I 'can't remember at all' what happened after I pushed open that wooden cottage door. When I came back to my senses, I was already in that garden listening to the...

Mr. Nothing:
Umbrella-Boiling Hermit.

Lava:
Right, listening to the Umbrella-Boiling Hermit tell stories. I have absolutely no impression of how I came to be here. Also, I don't know where 'here' is either.

Kroos:
We're all the same.

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor, there's one thing I know for certain. This isn't Ni-weng Village...

Mr. Nothing:
Though I haven't visited Ni-weng in a few years, the way of the land is fashioned quite old. I ran all the way here just now, and I saw not a single electric cable!

Lava:
That makes things even tougher...

Kroos:
It's just like we're dreaming, eh.

Lava:
......

Kroos:
I know what you're thinking, but right now, we've got no other way. We can only trust each other.

Mr. Nothing:
Ho? Benefactors! You shouldn't doubt me now! I'm not the sort of lout that flouts others' graces to him! I'd hardly even be able!

Lava:
That's not what I meant...

Lava:
I'm just taking in the situation. Everything's been too strange.

Kroos:
We're not saying we don't trust you, Nothing, mate, it's just we need to be cool and think about all the possibilities here.

Kroos:
Baseline is it's some kind of trap. Whether everything in front of us is real or not.. is a tough question.

Mr. Nothing:
Now, benefactor, don't treat me like I'm young. I may be carefree as the wind, but I'd still wager I'm older than you...

Lava:
Originium Arts... the possibility's there. But the difficulty's beyond. Is it connected to some specific place? Or did they conjure an outright illusion for us...

Mr. Nothing:
You're quite the eccentrics, my benefactors. Any normal person would never be capable of this line of thought under these pressing circumstances.

Lava:
'Any normal person,' yeah.

Lava:
Even if we don't know where we are, the geography here is way off.

Lava:
The sun and moon are fixed in opposite places, most of the houses are built towards the night side here, while the farms and market are on the other end... but the locals seem totally used to it, and just now, those things...

Lava:
We need information. The faster, the better.

Lava:
The bells are ringing again...?

Kroos:
You only hear bells that sound like this in Yan and Higashi.

Rough Villager:
The bells! The bells! Everyone, it's alright! We're safe now!

Vigilant Villager:
So soon?

Rough Villager:
I didn't notice a hint of those things! I saw those outsiders pushing back those monsters for us!

Vigilant Villager:
They're not even scared of the things?

Rough Villager:
As I see it, we should do this in one go! Charge in the mountains and wipe them at the root! I've had it with how they just come whenever they want!

Storyteller:
Don't be like that. You can't be too difficult.

Rough Villager:
Oh, sir... you're back!

Storyteller:
I-Ch'uan, go now and find those three heroes, and tell them I insist they come to my place for a chat. Lest we neglect them, we must properly convey our thanks.

Rough Villager:
Got it!

???:
Hark, I am most at home when I work this bell! If the old head priest of my monastery knew I were still so diligent in foreign lands, he would surely be comforted severalfold.

???:
Saga!

Saga:
Oh, the Shopkeeper! What is the matter?

Shopkeeper:
I heard the bell; that means it's all over, right?

Shopkeeper:
I heard from Mister I-Ch'uan that some guests from afar helped defend the village. Have you seen them?

Saga:
Nay, I have been posted at the bell all this time, have I not? Yet if I had a belltower like unto the one in my monastery, mayhaps I could have seen them from afar.

Saga:
To speak of which, I have been here for some time now. This is the first time I have seen the Ink Spirits come in such great waves. Is it mere happenstance?

Shopkeeper:
That's why I wanted to ask if you could go meet those strangers.

Saga:
Oh?
