Little Girl:
Uwhhh, *whimper*...

Mr. Nothing:
Young lady, look at how the sky is bright now. We've gone quite a far way, and we'll be there soon. Don't you cry.

Little Girl:
*whimper*...

Mr. Nothing:
Now, now, I'm here with you. You're perfectly safe.

Mr. Nothing:
*Sigh*... don't cry, now, don't cry. Look, you can see the garden. We'll be right there.

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Little Girl:
Yaaahhh—!

Mr. Nothing:
Wh—Why are they here?! Weren't they meant to fear the sun?!

Mr. Nothing:
Come, ride on my back, hold on!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Little Girl:
Mister! Mister, run faster!

Mr. Nothing:
Don't—Don't pull on my hair! My glasses are falling off!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa! Gkhaa!

Kroos:
He runs pretty darn quick, that Mr. Nothing.

Villager:
Hero, what are you talking about?

Kroos:
Hm? Ah, nothing. You get to the garden and hide quick. Leave the outside watch to me.

Kroos:
Hmm...

Kroos:
That miniature Ink Spirit seems a little faster than your garden variety Originium slug... but it also looks like it's gone a little dizzy?

Kroos:
Maybe it really can't catch up to Mr. Nothing...? Who'd have thought?

Ink Spirit:
Gkh... gkhaa... gkhaa...

Mr. Nothing:
Watch this! Hey! Heh! Yah!

Mr. Nothing:
Hahah! Can't get us now, can you!

Ink Spirit:
Gkh!?

Little Girl:
Mister! Run a little faster, come on!

Mr. Nothing:
I've wanted to do that forever! Pull off a little something when you're chased through the streets, just like all those martial arts stars on the silver screen!

Little Girl:
F—Faster! Faster!

Mr. Nothing:
Don't smack me! I'm not a burdenbeast!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaakh—!

Mr. Nothing:
It went around!? With the sun shining on its ass! Didn't they say these things feared sunlight?

Little Girl:
S—Save us!

Mr. Nothing:
Tck! Here, young lady, you go on ahead, I'll—

Ink Spirit:
Gkh!

Ink Spirit:
Gkh!?

Ink Spirit:
Gkh... gkh...

Mr. Nothing:
It's Kroos, my benefactor! Dear me, here, good benefactor, come, if you had a free hand, you could've helped me a little sooner! Er, where, where are you?

Kroos:
Right here.

Little Girl:
Yah...! M—Miss, where did you come from?

Mr. Nothing:
Wow! I'd be remiss not to laud your sniping skills as beyond the blue! You slip about like a ghost, land without a whisper! You really are—

Little Girl:
Miss! Thank you for saving mister!

Mr. Nothing:
Err.

Kroos:
Run on back, quick. Your mum's been looking for you for ages now.

Little Girl:
Mm-hm!

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor, why don't you hurry to Lava and Saga's aid? Let me keep watch here, safeguard the perimeter.

Kroos:
Didn't you just cross your heart you'd return to Lava to help her?

Mr. Nothing:
B—Benefactor, might you have the gift of clairaudience...?

Kroos:
Nope.

Kroos:
Why've you been holding onto that folding fan the whole time?

Mr. Nothing:
Ah, I simply must! This fan is the most precious thing I have, a present to me from my most respected teacher! I'd hate to let it out of my grasp!

Mr. Nothing:
Moreover, here, clasping this fan in my hand, I look quite refined, don't I?

Kroos:
Hmmmgh...

Kroos:
Why'd that Ink Spirit get over here just now without any trouble? It counts as daytime, right?

Mr. Nothing:
I was wondering too! That cretin chased the wind out of me!

Kroos:
Hmm... anyhow, better head for Lava.

Lava:
It's quiet.

Lava:
We're clearly on the fringe of night here. I can only see a crack of dawnlight. Why aren't any monsters charging through?

Saga:
I also thought it strange. It has never been so peaceful, has it?

Dawn:
Isn't it good that it's peaceful?

Saga:
Ha! That is so. I may at last catch my breath!

Saga:
Huff!

Dawn:
Careful you don't crush any goods.

Lava:
......

Lava:
Saga, the Dusk Beauty you mentioned just now... who does that refer to?

Saga:
Naturally, the Dusk Beauty of the well-told 'Dusk Beauty Flying to the Moon' tale. My word, to this day I cannot forget the sight of the eyes of Dusk Beauty—

Lava:
...???

Dawn:
Saga, tell it a little slower. Miss Lava's giving you a funnier and funnier look.

Saga:
Oh, beg pardon, 'twas my impatience. Lava, thou art also tired from withstanding Ink Spirits, art thou not? Ought we perhaps sit down with some tea, and there make proper talk?

Dawn:
Sure. I'll go brew you some tea, then.

Saga:
Right, I would like to ask thee first. Young Dawn, dost thou know any way of leaving this place?

Dawn:
No.

Saga:
Thou dost not?

Dawn:
(Lightly shakes head)
