Lava:
What was that woman called?

Saga:
I know not.

Lava:
He never asked?

Saga:
He never dared.

Lava:
......

Saga:
Moreover, when dreams seem fantasy, truth seems false, when what passes is perhaps a year, yet may be a snap of the fingers—between other worlds—where should one go to ask?

Lava:
......

Saga:
Traveling the country of Yan, I inevitably find myself thinking back on this story. Poring over it, it may have only been my head priest putting on a show for me, haphazardly making up a story.

Saga:
But in my queries all across Yan, I was surprised to find this 'Scene of Crude Mounts Utmost Risen' has some small reputation.

Saga:
'Twas said it was an obscure artist about a hundred years prior who left it, and past relatives of the Emperor could not obtain it with all their riches, giving it its fame.

Saga:
By fortune I was close to Mount Hui-ch'i, and I had the sudden thought to take this chance, to see whether or not I could find the sublime scenery in that painting...

Saga:
Hah hah. I found enchanting hills and waters in the mountains, and before I could react, I had already ended up here.

Lava:
The cottage on Mount Hui-ch'i. That's exactly where we were too...

Lava:
Could this place be a dream?

Saga:
If it were a dream, then to thee, I would only be its illusion, and thou would be unable to trust my words.

Saga:
If thou art unable to trust, then how dost thou judge the scenery before thee, Lava? Is it a dream, or not?

Lava:
Slow down... you're gonna give me a headache...

Lava:
Okay, then do you know how to get out of here?

Saga:
Traveling to this day, I still have not come to understand how I may leave of my own accord.

Lava:
To this day? How long have you been staying in here?

Saga:
For a very, very long time. Allow me to count...

Dawn:
Your tea'll get cold soon. Don't get lost chatting; give the tea a taste.

Lava:
Ah... thank you.

Lava:
(Phew...)

Lava:
Hm? Now that we mention it, Miss Dawn, don't tell me you're also...?

Dawn:
I'm just a local pawnbroker.

Dawn:
Miss Lava... I really appreciate your kindness, and admire your intent to protect the villagers from the Ink Spirits, but please think more about your own safety, if you have the time.

Lava:
Those monsters aren't a threat to Rhodes Island's elite.

Saga:
Words without falsehood. The good Lava is a person of fine ability. You need not worry!

Dawn:
If true, then I suppose it's alright.

Dawn:
Miss Lava, I've got a question, and I'm not sure whether I should ask it.

Lava:
Ask away. You don't really need to be that reserved with me...

Dawn:
Miss Lava, have you ever looked close at the moon in the water?

Dawn:
No matter how the moonlight in the water is torn apart gleaming on the waves, when all comes to a calm, it will still be that same full moon.

Dawn:
If you pity the moonlight in that time it flickers across the water, then it's not at all necessary you wet your shoes and brave the cold.

Dawn:
Miss Lava, so as to fish up that moon in the water, would you... give your utmost thought?

Lava:
I... I don't think I would? There's not much sense in doing things like that, is there?

Lava:
What's got you mentioning this out of nowhere?

Dawn:
I don't know what that bright moon of yours looks like, Miss Lava, and I have no way to point out where you're falling short. But the moon in the water, in the end, is only the moon in the water.

Dawn:
It's not necessary to do it for our sakes.

Lava:
You mean...?

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactors! My benefactors! You're alright, aren't you?

Kroos:
Oh, man, you even got tea going, and you still didn't call me over.

Dawn:
I assume these two are also esteemed guests of P'o-shan Village? I'll go brew the tea, and bring some pastries too. Take your time to chat.

Kroos:
And who might this be?

Lava:
The shopkeeper here. She's called Dawn. Dawn like the daybreak.

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor, what of those Ink Spirits? Oho, I see! Surely, with your invincible might, you drove them all away!

Lava:
—Is that little girl safe yet?

Kroos:
She's safe. Safe and sound.

Mr. Nothing:
Ohh, ohh, benefactor, how could you doubt me so... I've waded through dangers extreme without shedding a tear, and now I am somewhat sad...!

Dawn:
Here's your tea.

Kroos:
Mmm... I can tell it's expensive with just a whiff.

Mr. Nothing:
How insightful, benefactor! Plain folk like me could only reckon it bitter. We'd never make sense of the taste.

Dawn:
It's just ordinary tea. They only sell this one kind in the market. Please forgive me if it doesn't suit you.

Kroos:
Phhaahh~ I might be used to black tea and coffee, but there's just this special kind of taste to Yan tea whenever I try it.

Saga:
My hometown also has tea whose flavor can be said to be unique. If the chance should come, thou must allow me to display my skills.

Lava:
Haaahhh...

Kroos:
Alright there, Lava? You getting sleepy?

Lava:
I'm not. I just kind of chilled out suddenly...

Dawn:
Tea nourishes the heart. What troubles you can't be resolved just by rushing about.

Lava:
We still don't have much of a lead.

Saga:
In the world within the painting, one can only take things slowly.

Lava:
Oh, yeah! Saga, have you ever seen this thing before?

Saga:
I do not know at all... Only, I know not why, but I feel I have seen this object somewhere in the past...

Lava:
Really?!

Saga:
Allow me to think... ho... this texture... this material... I have, somewhen, somewhere, experienced it before...

Dawn:
—!

Kroos:
Huh?

Kroos:
The light reflecting off the tea...

Lava:
What's up?

Mr. Nothing:
Ho-hohh!? What's happening? Why is everyone standing up?

Saga:
The sky?

Dawn:
It's turning day...?

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Villager:
H—How did these things get near here?! This is the noontime street!

Villager:
N—No, the horizon... wh... when did the sun move over there? What's happening in Mount Hung-tung!?

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!!

Villager:
Aaaghhh! These things, they're—they're eating people—! Run, get out of here!

Storyteller:
...It passes on just like this, sun rising and moon setting, as it should be.

Storyteller:
Hmph.

Storyteller:
Does she mean... to disturb my peace?

Lava:
What... what's happening?

Lava:
Why would the sun...?

Kroos:
—This is how the sun's meant to be, Lava.

Lava:
Huh? Well, of course I know that, yeah, I'm just wondering why it went back to normal—

Lava:
Wait. Right. This is what's normal... what I was just thinking...?

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactors, why do I sense a great commotion in the village that way?

Villager:
Help me—help me! Help—

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Lava:
Are you alright?!

Villager:
I'm—I'm alright, so this is where you were, that's great, great! Those monsters just aren't afraid of sunlight anymore now!

Villager:
They're in the village, ea-ea-ea... eating people!
