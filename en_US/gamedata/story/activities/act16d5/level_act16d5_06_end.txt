Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa—!

Lava:
Is it just me or there are fewer of them?

Kroos:
It does look that way, and they don't seem that scary any more.

Mr. Nothing:
Could they have forgotten about us?

Mr. Nothing:
Day after day, year after year, all that they ever do is attack the village for naught... it's wretched, and heartwrenching!

Lava:
How would you know? They don't talk—

Mr. Nothing:
They—I suppose they just might be able to speak.

Saga:
What? The head priest always said we must forever be compassionate. If that really is the case, then we are in quite a pickle...

Lava:
But if this is really just a painting...

Lava:
Maybe we've already found the right place.

Lava:
I should've figured this out sooner. Damn it, Nian... She didn't tell us about this on purpose...

Kroos:
She's probably worried we'd let something slip that would tip Dusk off and let her get away.

Lava:
Would someone that powerful even run? To be honest with you, I'm a little scared of her...

Lava:
Let's not talk about how all of this works for now. She's keeping us live humans hostage in this little world she created for herself. What's this supposed to mean?

Lava:
Anything we eat might as well be real, and not only that, the people here can actually hold a conversation. Is this supposed to mean anything?

Lava:
If she's able to do all this with just Arts, then this sister of Nian's—

Kroos:
You're right about that... I've seen lots of weird Originium Arts before, but this is maybe a little too out there.

Mr. Nothing:
My... Never in a thousand moons would I have imagined the person you are looking for could be so... extraordinary.

Saga:
Is that so? Here I was thinking that, of all the places I've visited, this P'o-shan has to be one of the simplest, most unassuming towns.

Lava:
Where have you been...?

Saga:
Why, I could go all morning about this.

Saga:
During my travels, I have come across many an odd character. I have met someone who would use ale as a blade and betake herself like lightning. I have also seen someone fight with the most peculiar style, able to swim up a waterfall.

Saga:
I have met one so sagacious, he could write a poem in eight steps. Alas, he offended the wrong men, and practically had to bring with him his own coffin to his final audience with his liege.

Saga:
I have seen the famed Boulder of Pei-Hsüan. According to legend, in eras past, the boulder sprang up from the ground, suspending in midair when an emperor of the past ascended to his throne.

Saga:
At first, it was thought to portend the country's prosperous future under his rule, but it was also thought to mean he had a heavy load to bear, and was thus seen as an omen by many.

Saga:
I have visited a mountain that scraped the skies, where, amidst the clusters of Originium left behind by Catastrophes, there stood solemnly a towering pine tree, reaching upwards, as though splitting the sea of clouds in twain.

Saga:
I have seen many a blade piercing chessboards, books sauteed in woks. I have also met a woman of Yan performing the most extraordinary feat, forging a city all on her own. Yet, strangely, it was hazy in appearance, and she would only allow us to view the city from afar, not in its vicinity.

Saga:
I would be remiss to forget the Yan emperor's close friend from faraway lands. He told the Lung of his journey to the west, and of the countless towns and cities his travels took him.

Saga:
Each and every time he spoke, I could see the townscapes before my eyes!

Saga:
—Anyway, I know a thing or two because I've seen a thing or two.

Mr. Nothing:
Uhh, I know of this Boulder of Pei-Hsüan. I was under the impression it was destroyed years ago during a Catastrophe?

Saga:
Exactly the one. I saw it float with my own eyes—

Mr. Nothing:
How many years ago was that?!

Saga:
I just want to make sure. The person you speak of... That's her sister?

Lava:
That's right.

Saga:
How is their relationship...?

Lava:
......

Kroos:
Oh~ Getting right to the meat of it.

Mr. Nothing:
Could it be the sisters are not on the best of terms?

Lava:
Remember the thing I showed you? Nian gave me that. At first, I thought she gave it to us to prove our identities to Dusk...

Saga:
Ohh, the fascinating little trinket? What is its purpose, then?

Lava:
No idea...

Mr. Nothing:
Allow me? Oh, have you shown this to the storyteller?

Saga:
Hm, has he seen it already? Did... Did he say anything about it?

Lava:
He said he's never seen it.

Saga:
I think... we should still have him take a look.

Mr. Nothing:
Err, if I may, there is actually one other thing that has left me quite perplexed...

Lava:
What's up?

Mr. Nothing:
Well, I mean, my benefactor, you saw me take on one of the fiends, did you not?

Lava:
Oh... You mean how it took you forever and a half just to get away from one of the Ink Spirits?

Mr. Nothing:
Precisely!

Saga:
I saw it too, but why that all of a sudden?

Mr. Nothing:
Well... I am but a defenseless layman in the martial arts. Be that as it may, I cracked an entire canister of whoop-ass on the fiend. Surely you too must find that strange!

Kroos:
Uh... You call that a can of whoop-ass?

Mr. Nothing:
—*Cough* *cough*! Umm, well, I have a few tricks up my sleeve—Now, I implore you, don't get the wrong idea. It's not that I don't want to do my part in our battle against the monsters. I just have my reasons—

Lava:
So, your point is...?

Mr. Nothing:
Um, my benefactor, certainly you believe me?

Lava:
I certainly believe you not. You may be good at tricking people, but definitely not me. If I couldn't figure this much out, I wouldn't be any use out here on a mission.

Saga:
Oh, I had my doubts about that too! I saw Master Nothing dart away with the little girl on his back in no time and without a breaking a sweat. I am certain he is no less formidable than my fellow disciples back at the temple!

Mr. Nothing:
H-Haha, please, don't give me that look. I'm trying my best now, am I not?

Mr. Nothing:
Right! It's getting late! Let's make our way to the storyteller and check on him! He is ill, is he not?

Storyteller:
*cough*... Are you here for my tales? My apologies, but I'm afraid I won't have any stories to tell today with the shape I'm in.

Villager:
Please, you must get more rest. Just leave everything to us.

Storyteller:
You need not worry. I'm fine... *cough*... This is the first time we've met, is it not? Where are you from, my friends?

Mr. Nothing:
Why, uh... I'm from quite far away. I'm merely passing through, but with all the men in the village singing the praises of your storytelling, I had to come hear for myself!

Mr. Nothing:
But if you're indisposed, then we could... pay you a visit another day. Yes, we shall return, haha.

Storyteller:
A moment, please. *cough* I cannot fault you for not knowing, but we rarely have any visitors here in P'o-shan, and I am not one to turn away those who wish to hear my stories.

Storyteller:
I have a guest room in my garden. Perhaps you would be so kind as to stay the night?

Lava:
Are you feeling okay?

Storyteller:
I'm not sure myself. It might just be a cold... though it certainly doesn't seem that way. The doctor wasn't sure of the cause either. I suppose it's a sign my body's gotten weaker because I've been neglecting my training. Please, don't pay it any mind.

Storyteller:
I-Ch'uan, take them there.

Villager:
Of course.

Lava:
Well... We'll take you up on the offer, then.

Villager:
Please, this way.

Mr. Nothing:
Why, this is peculiar. I walked out of this very house in the morning and went on a stroll, and now I'm being invited to stay here anew... This really makes no sense!

Mr. Nothing:
Well, my benefactors...

Kroos:
Nothing.

Mr. Nothing:
Uh... Haha... *Ahem*. I am not getting out of this one, am I? I understand.

Mr. Nothing:
Well... Where should I begin...? After all, I've been deceiving the two of you right from the start.

Lava:
That I've more or less figured out.

Mr. Nothing:
Please accept my apologies.

Lava:
You sure know how to switch up your attitude quick, don't you? Oh well, whatever. I understand. You can't just completely trust a person you come across out in the wastes.

Mr. Nothing:
You have my thanks.

Lava:
Are you from Kou-wu?

Mr. Nothing:
No... my hometown is farther north. Just your regular small town.

Mr. Nothing:
I had resigned myself to live a normal, uninteresting life as a plowboy. That summer, a few men from the cities came to our town, led by a fine, magnificent lady. She said I was the one they sought.

Mr. Nothing:
I was just thirteen at the time. They brought me to Kou-wu to a martial arts school, the Liens, and she was its master.

Mr. Nothing:
That's how I met my master, and all there was to it. I had room and board, and when I had the time, I could help out at construction sites and earn some coin to send to my family back home.

Mr. Nothing:
I remained diligent over the past ten years, but never once did I think my master did me a favor for taking me in.

Mr. Nothing:
I made it a point to rely on none but myself. I would rather go without a meal than be looked down upon by my master.

Mr. Nothing:
But... she was getting on in years. I once thought her formidable, matchless, even. But she was seriously ill. Couldn't even get a decent night's sleep.

Mr. Nothing:
That was when I came to realize I could stay there no longer. All my fellow disciples had left, and it was my time to do so as well.

Mr. Nothing:
But... last year, I killed someone by accident. Someone whom I should not have killed.

Mr. Nothing:
I thought it was a friendly match between dojos. It wasn't until much later that I found out the man had sold his life. He was meant to die by my hands.

Mr. Nothing:
The Lien style's reputation was already on its last legs, but they wanted to defame our name nonetheless. It was all a ploy to bring my master to swallow her pride and get her down on her knees.

Mr. Nothing:
—And then—

Mr. Nothing:
My master, her hair white as ash and braided just like my mother's, stood before all and spilled her own blood as the rules dictated!

Saga:
...My goodness!

Mr. Nothing:
'Rules!' It's murder, I tell you!

Mr. Nothing:
I brought my unconscious master back, but they had our school completely surrounded.

Mr. Nothing:
I could not call for an ambulance, let alone my fellow disciples!

Mr. Nothing:
All I could do was watch her body turn cold. Their men stood outside, unmoving until they saw my poor master buried.

Mr. Nothing:
My master left me with this fan. I don't have the courage to use it, and certainly not the moves she taught me.

Mr. Nothing:
The school was lost, and I had no way to get in touch with my fellow disciples. So I concealed my identity, masquerading as a fortune teller, a Messenger.

Mr. Nothing:
But no matter the case, I did whatever it took to leave that city, and I will make my way to the capital or Lungmen, wherever. The more people there, the better—

Mr. Nothing:
—Then, one day, I shall return to Kou-wu City and make things right.

Mr. Nothing:
That is the story... my benefactor, Kroos, what you said on the day of the rescue. You had the right of it.

Mr. Nothing:
All those years I spent in Kou-wu City... I wasted.

Saga:
I heard stories of the Yan martial artists' sense of honor, yet never would I have imagined such a tale...

Lava:
So it wasn't just a traffic accident...

Mr. Nothing:
Correct... the villains had men in every corner of Kou-wu City! I watched in hiding from a nearby village, but luck was not on my side. In the end, my only choice was to find myself a car and skip town—

Kroos:
Your master had gone that far, and they still wouldn't leave you alone?

Mr. Nothing:
Leave me alone?

Mr. Nothing:
If they had their minds set on leaving anyone alone, I doubt they would bend the rules to kill!

Saga:
To think that there are rules this rotten and unreasonable... 'Twould seem there is yet much for me to learn about this world.

Lava:
Alright then... This all sounds like something out of a martial arts novel, but well... I believe you.

Mr. Nothing:
*sobs*, my benefactor! Your reason moves me! As your stalwart underling, rest assured I'll do all that it takes to return the favor, come hell or high water!

Lava:
*Sigh*...

Mr. Nothing:
My benefactor... you wouldn't think I'm still lying, would you?

Lava:
Well, you'd be one hell of a liar if that was a lie.

Lava:
Please, come in.

Storyteller:
*cough*... Full glad am I to find you here, my guests. I thought you would be resting in your room. Could you find our hospitality wanting, perchance...?

Lava:
Uh, no, not at all. We are just talking about something among ourselves.

Storyteller:
*cough*, I see... Pray accept my humblest apologies for interrupting. I merely wished to caution you against visiting Mt. Hung-tung. It is abound with monsters ahead of the New Year.

Lava:
Okay, thanks for the reminder.

Storyteller:
Most certainly. I shall take my leave now... *cough*—

Lava:
Hope you get better soon.

Lava:
......

Kroos:
What's up?

Lava:
The Umbrella-Boiler guy... You think he's from inside the painting?

Lava:
If even this is part of the painting... what about us?
