Villager:
Is there anyone still left here? Hurry over to the storyteller's and hide!

Villager:
To the east, hurry!

Lava:
Ever since we noticed the sky, I've been conscious of how the further west you go, the more nighttime it actually gets...

Mr. Nothing:
If so, are we currently heading 'from the noon to the twilight?' Quite a poetic ring, actually.

Lava:
It's not right. The distance 'from daytime to nighttime' is just too short. We've only gone how far?

Saga:
The length of the painting's scroll does vary, and its every sight is a strange, wonderful turn. The people in the picture have all set customs for their world, but in the end, it is still artificial. That much is unavoidable.

Lava:
And I'm saying—wait, what?

Saga:
What?

Lava:
What did you just s—

???:
Gyaaaaghh—!

Lava:
—! Someone's still here?!

Saga:
This way!

Villager:
S—Save me!

Saga:
Fear not, I am here!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa—

Saga:
Ho, just as expected. Once cut down, it becomes an ink stain. Most strange, most strange.

Mr. Nothing:
Master, I commend your talent!

Saga:
Lower not your guard, good girl, and make haste for the east!

Villager:
Got it! You all be careful too!

Lava:
It looks like quite a few villagers didn't run in time.

Saga:
It was likely too sudden, no chance to—

Little Girl:
Papa? Mama?

Mr. Nothing:
Th—There's a child there!

Saga:
Oh no—get down, now!

Mr. Nothing:
She won't make it!

Little Girl:
Uwaahhh... waaaaaahh...

Little Girl:
Ahh!

Mr. Nothing:
Whoa, there, too close for comfort!

Mr. Nothing:
Are you okay?

Little Girl:
Uwaaahhh... yeah... uwahhh...

Mr. Nothing:
Just... just now, did something stab that creature in the throat...?

Lava:
That would be Kroos. What a tricky angle.

Mr. Nothing:
Where—Where is she?

Lava:
Don't look, you won't find her. As long as we know she's here, that's good enough. Gotta prioritize ensuring every villager makes it out of the night.

Saga:
Ho, quite the profound rapport. My horizons do broaden.

Little Girl:
Wahhh... uwh-uwaah...

Mr. Nothing:
B—But how do we bring this young girl with us?

Lava:
You take her out of here, and to somewhere safe. Okay?

Mr. Nothing:
Verily! As if I couldn't!

Mr. Nothing:
However—I really cannot bear to cast off my benefactors and take refuge alone! The fact I cannot accompany my benefactors in lopping off heads and spilling fresh blood is a true shame—

Lava:
You can take the child to Mr. Umbrella's place first and then come back to us.

Mr. Nothing:
Ahahah... ah... alright, very well now. Very well.

Mr. Nothing:
Young miss, would you care to come with me?

Little Girl:
*Sob*... *whimper*... mister, have you seen my mama...? *whimper*...

Mr. Nothing:
I'll take you to find her, okay?

Little Girl:
Hic... mm-hm... thank you, mister...

Mr. Nothing:
Ahem. Benefactor, shall I depart for now then?

Lava:
Yes.

Storyteller:
......

Villager:
Sir, will we be safe, relying on just Saga and the three heroes?

Storyteller:
......

Villager:
Sir...?

Storyteller:
No matter.

Villager A:
What's wrong with him? Is he in a bad mood today? Did he forget to sleep last night?

Villager B:
Sir has culture and grace. He's not the temperamental kind.

Villager A:
I bet he's tired, worrying all about us. We should give him some space, let him sleep.

Saga:
Cleanse the six senses!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Saga:
Sever all desires!

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Saga:
Aburaage!

Ink Spirit:
Gkh... gkhaa?

Lava:
You're pretty strong yourself.

Saga:
I grew from childhood in the monastery. It influenced me, and I learned a few ways of the sword. That is all.

Lava:
You call that a few?

Saga:
Mind not. Stay while I open a path for thee, Lava!

Ink Spirit:
Gkh... gkhaa!

Lava:
Those monsters are starting to fear you... now that I mention it, do Ink Spirits even have intelligence?

Ink Spirit:
Gkh! Gkhaa! Gkhaakh ghkaa!

Saga:
Ho?

Lava:
Why'd you stop?

Ink Spirit:
Gkh, gkh-gkhaa, gkhaahgkhaa...

Saga:
Hm, hm-hm, hm...

Lava:
Wait?! You can understand what it's saying?!

Saga:
A bare perception. If thou wouldst observe, this Ink Spirit has not committed any wrongdoing, as if it sincerely regrets, and it will no longer torment the village. We shall let it go, then.

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa!

Lava:
Is that okay?

Saga:
It is alright. I know it to be proper.

Ink Spirit:
Gkh...

Lava:
It's fallen quiet now... There shouldn't be any other villagers remaining. Can we have a chat for a moment?

Saga:
Lava, thou art indeed solemn. Perhaps I have done wrong in some way?

Lava:
No, you're fine, it's just what you said before... a painting scroll? It seems like you understand this place.

Saga:
Indeed. I am a wanderer, and have been so for some time.

Lava:
This place doesn't seem to deserve the word 'wandering.'

Saga:
How large can a single scroll be?

Lava:
What do you mean... are we in a picture?

Saga:
That is so.

Lava:
What exactly do you mean?

Saga:
Ah, I understand now. Your party is akin to me, having erred and fallen into these mountains and rivers—

Lava:
Huh?

Saga:
At the outset, I was only passing through the Kou-wu boundary in Yan. Suddenly, I had the thought that I wanted to visit the posterity of the great artist.

Saga:
The sight under the waterfalls of Mount Hui-ch'i is beautiful beyond comprehension, and I slept one night in a thatched cottage in the mountains. I had never thought that next I opened my eyes, I would be here.

Lava:
Hold on, wait. Wait. What do you mean? You were looking for 'Dusk' too?

Saga:
Dusk? I have never heard tell of this name before...

Saga:
The one I sought was the Yan painter for whom 'one stroke crude mounts rose, whence the words, winds, flow.'

Saga:
But working out the days, I feared that painter had already left our world of mortals, and thus thought to call upon their former residence. That is all.

Lava:
In any case, first you went to Mount Hui-ch'i in Kou-wu in Yan, and then you inexplicably ended up here, right?!

Saga:
Ho, that is not false, but why does it agitate thee so?

Lava:
And then you said this place is a painting scroll—

Saga:
Nothing of this world conforms to reason. Lava, didst thou never realize?

Lava:
No, I know that. But why a painting...?

Saga:
It is difficult to explain, but I have traveled this P'o-shan Village across... about a hundred or more scrolls now! At least, I am well aware of where I myself am.

Lava:
Guh... those people are real, living people, the tea has flavor, the fruit is edible...

Lava:
Is this all just some sort of Arts? But if it was... then what kind of...

Saga:
It is completely beyond my reckoning. Had I not the fortune to glimpse the truth of this world, I fear that I too would be unable to realize where I am.

Saga:
No Catastrophe disturbs here, and all living beings follow their own customs, creating their own enclosure, too wondrous for words. Staying here, I have never wanted for ease.

Lava:
That's...

Saga:
Hah-hah, the look on thine face is all too unavoidable. When I first met that dusken Hsi-o, she took the same look as thee...

Lava:
Slow down... who did you say you met?!

Saga:
I met a—wait now. Those lights, could they be the merchant's shop? So she never took refuge! We must act!

Lava:
Wait for me!

Shopkeeper:
......

Ink Spirit:
Gkhaa...

Shopkeeper:
Alright, alright. Don't get so excited.

Shopkeeper:
Why did you come scare the people? What did she tell you?

Shopkeeper:
Ah... I see... she's still the same as ever.

Saga:
Shopkeep!

Shopkeeper:
...Go.

Ink Spirit:
Gkh...

Saga:
Shopkeep, be thou well?

Shopkeeper:
I'm fine... And who is this?

Saga:
Oh, this good person is Lava, one of the outsiders who were all the hubbub earlier.

Shopkeeper:
Nice to meet you.

Saga:
This is the proprietor of this shop. Her sole name is 'Dawn,' as of the daybreak.

Lava:
You didn't get attacked by any weird things?

Dawn:
I'm not aware of any such things.

Lava:
......

Saga:
Young Dawn, I do not know if those Ink Spirits may return again. Wouldst thou permit us to lie in hiding here, to observe for a bare while?

Dawn:
Mm-hm. Alright.
