Amiya:
Huh? Oh, sorry, Doctor. I was spacing out.

Amiya:
Ah, um, there's a matter of some concern.

Amiya:
Doctor, look, it's an internal transfer application.

Amiya:
The applicant is Natalya Rostova.

Amiya:
She wants to transfer from Logistics to the front line.

Amiya:
Right. She's the only member working in Logistics.

Amiya:
I understand they appreciate her talent and efficiency.

Amiya:
Of course you'd be worried about it too. Honestly, I don't really want to approve this one.

Amiya:
I get it. Ursus names are hard. I'm not surprised you forgot.

Amiya:
She's one of the survivors we rescued from Chernobog, and a member of Zima's Ursus Student Self-Governing Group.

Amiya:
In fact, she was the only aristocrat among the refugees.

Amiya:
Do you remember that Zima's team became combat operators at their own request?

Amiya:
I was actually against it at first.

Amiya:
Right. Originally, even though they requested it themselves, I was going to convince Dr. Kal'tsit to veto the application.

Amiya:
It's just...

Amiya:
They get regular psychological counseling and according to the reports, they're generally healthy, notwithstanding the occasional dark spot.

Amiya:
It's just...

Amiya:
Thanks, Doctor.

Amiya:
It's just...

Amiya:
I don't know how to put it better.

Amiya:
...Doctor, can you go check on Miss Rostova?

Amiya:
Thanks, Doctor.

Amiya:
I know it's kind of a pain, but you're the only one who can do it, Doctor.

Amiya:
Doctor, this is really important. Don't be lazy.

Amiya:
And you really don't have to take it too seriously. Just think of it as a little change of scenery.

Amiya:
Oh, it's already lunchtime. No need to rush, you can go see her after you eat.

Zima:
Hey, Doctor.

Zima:
Nothing. Just saying hey, since I saw you.

Zima:
Hey, don't pretend you didn't hear me. I saw you stop.

Zima:
Aren't you like super busy all the time? What are you doing wandering the halls?

Zima:
You don't look busy.

Zima:
I've got a mission. I can't be enjoying a leisurely stroll like you.

Nearl:
I told you not to wander before deployments, Zima.

Zima:
......

Nearl:
Afternoon, Doctor.

Nearl:
Come on, Zima, back to the ready room. It's time to go.

Zima:
Hmph. One day I'm gonna be the captain and boss you around.

Zima:
You too, Doctor. You're gonna answer to me.

Nearl:
I like the ambition. Let's talk about it after you've got one on me.

Nearl:
As for the Doctor, well, you'll have to have won a lot more than one.

Zima:
Eh.

Nearl:
Oh, Doctor, you should know, I've been taking the rookie team lately.

Nearl:
So if you don't have anything else, I'll get going.

Nearl:
Hm?

Nearl:
Hm... Well, you just saw that she doesn't take well to discipline. She's very insubordinate.

Nearl:
And as a warrior, at her age, it's normal to not know what you're fighting, or what you're fighting for.

Nearl:
But it's especially obvious for Zima.

Nearl:
She suffers from a lot of confusion. I don't know exactly what it is, but it's a bad sign and something I'm going to focus on correcting next.

Nearl:
Right. Violence is a protective shell for her.

Nearl:
I wouldn't go so far as to say she has a fragile heart under that shell, but I can say that toughness is very fragile, in front of me.

Nearl:
Don't worry, Doctor. She's still a kid.

Nearl:
I heard she's from Chernobog. I'm sure she's carrying a lot of baggage. But she has a future.

Nearl:
Hah, don't worry, Doctor.

Nearl:
You must know, she doesn't hate you or anything.

Nearl:
In fact, she seems to reflexively attack people close to her.

Nearl:
But I do have to say, I think this kid's all right, Doctor.

Nearl:
In fact, I like her. She's got a strong sense of integrity. So even if she's confused, that integrity will keep her on the right path.

Nearl:
And that's rare.

Nearl:
Okay, I gotta get going. Please excuse me.

Gummy:
Wow, it's the Doctor!

Gummy:
Afternoon, Doctor!

Gummy:
Am I too short?!

Gummy:
Hellooo, Doctor, do you see me?

Gummy:
You're looking good today!

Gummy:
Are you here to eat?

Gummy:
I haven't had any missions lately, so I'm helping out in the kitchen.

Perfumer:
Gummy, I brought the spices.

Gummy:
Oh, thanks, Perfumer! Just put them over there.

Gummy:
Did you want something to eat?

Perfumer:
No thank you. I'm used to cooking for myself in my workshop.

Gummy:
Oooh, can I come eat with you sometime? I really wanna learn to use spices like you do!

Perfumer:
Heh heh. But of course.

Matterhorn:
Gummy, can you lend a hand when you've got a minute?

Gummy:
Coming!

Matterhorn:
Hung is out on a mission and I'm a little short-handed. I need you to take this pot for me.

Gummy:
Sure, Uncle Matterhorn! I'll see you next time, Perfumer. And you eat well too, Doctor!

Perfumer:
Sure. You're welcome anytime.

Vanguard Operator:
Is Gummy cooking today?!

Logistics Operator:
Oh man, what luck!

Logistics Operator:
Too bad I just ate!

Vanguard Operator:
Haha, I'll get seconds!

Gummy:
Settle down, everybody. There's enough to go around!

Perfumer:
Gummy sure has a lot of energy, doesn't she, Doctor?

Perfumer:
One time, when she fell asleep in my workshop, I heard her talking in her sleep. What she said worried me a bit.

Perfumer:
But when I see her like this, adapting so well to life at Rhodes Island, I feel like I have nothing to worry about.

Perfumer:
You can't expect them to heal instantly. But given time, they'll be okay.

Perfumer:
Oh, Doctor, some things call for discretion, you know?

Perfumer:
I'll be keeping that secret for her. But rest assured, she doesn't need comfort, she just needs time.

Perfumer:
You care, Doctor? Heh heh. You really worry about your operators.

Perfumer:
But rest assured, if there was something really important, I wouldn't hold my tongue.

Perfumer:
A girl has her secrets, you know?

Perfumer:
Doctor, don't be so full of yourself that you think you have to take care of everyone.

Perfumer:
We can look after each other too.

Perfumer:
It's time I went back to the office.

Perfumer:
If you ever find yourself tired, Doctor, you can always come sit with me.

Istina:
Hello, Doctor.

Istina:
I've never seen you in the canteen before, Doctor.

Istina:
You look like you have something on your mind, Doctor. I suggest you find a better place to stand and think than the cafeteria doorway.

Istina:
Hm... the rice is a little firm today, and the soup is too sweet. But I'm enjoying the vegetables.

Istina:
If there's nothing more, Doctor, I'll be going.

Istina:
I have class in the afternoon.

Istina:
Yes, Hypatia's history class.

Istina:
After auditing for a while, I found Hypatia's take on history very helpful for me.

Istina:
Hm. No.

Istina:
Oh, I don't mean to refuse you. I'm having trouble explaining, because I'm not very clear either.

Istina:
Hypatia's lectures are very interesting. I think you should take a listen yourself, when you have time.

Istina:
Um, Doctor, did I not hear that you suffer from amnesia?

Istina:
But I appreciate the offer.

Istina:
I'll say, I could use some guidance.

Istina:
In fact, I'm not certain the study of history will help me that much.

Istina:
However, thinking on the experiences of our forebears could provide me some inspiration.

Istina:
I'm off to class then.

Istina:
Natalya...? You're looking for her?

Istina:
Gummy told me she wants to become a front line operator. I haven't heard if her application has been approved, but from what I know of her, she is likely already preparing for the transfer.

Leto:
Your aim sucks, Natalya.

Natalya:
Don't be so sure, Rosalind. I'm going to hit you.

Leto:
Hehe, no way in hell~

Leto:
And you gotta call me Leto now! Operator Rosa~

Natalya:
Okay, Operator Leto. Let us wait and see.

Leto:
And who got you using such a big sucker?

Leto:
You found it in Chernobog, right? Why not throw it away and get something new?

Natalya:
Hup... sentimental value.

Leto:
Okay. More work for you.

Leto:
It kinda looks like you can't move anymore. Why not take a little break?

Natalya:
I can still...

Natalya:
Agh!

Dobermann:
You lack stamina, Natalya.

Dobermann:
Being Ursus gives you a nice base to build on, but you're a long way from combat ready.

Natalya:
Pshh... whew... Sorry. I'll keep trying.

Dobermann:
But your willpower is a lot stronger than I thought. Not bad.

Dobermann:
If you can push through this round of training, it'll be good for you, even if you don't become an operator.

Natalya:
Thanks for that.

Dobermann:
Hm... hm?

Dobermann:
Take five.

Natalya:
Yes, sir!

Dobermann:
Leto, you get out there and train yourself.

Leto:
Yes, sir~

Dobermann:
Grace, keep an eye on her.

Instructor Grace:
Got it.

Dobermann:
Doctor, it's lunchtime. You should be resting. We don't need you here.

Dobermann:
Afternoon, Doctor.

Dobermann:
If you're just here to say hello to me, I've got plenty to get back to.

Dobermann:
You're slowly but surely becoming a leader. That's no bad thing, I have to say.

Dobermann:
You can, but I have to take time to deal with you. I hope it won't be a lot.

Dobermann:
But I guess Amiya told you we have another girl from Zima's group who wants to be an operator, and you wanted to check her out?

Dobermann:
Don't look so surprised.

Dobermann:
Everyone knows Amiya is very concerned about the survivors we rescued from Ursus.

Dobermann:
You must remember Zima, Gummy, Istina, Leto——

Dobermann:
Well, Leto is an exception. Nothing to worry about in the combat department.

Dobermann:
When those four girls applied, Amiya was dead-set against it. She wanted to veto their applications. I don't know why, but she changed her mind at some point in the process.

Dobermann:
And so now that there's another one, it would be out of character for her not to care...

Natalya:
Phew, that's enough rest. Rosalind, practice with me a while.

Leto:
Wow, you're really committed.

Natalya:
Don't underestimate my determination to become an operator.

Leto:
Alright alright.

Instructor Grace:
Natalya, you still need to rest. The most important part of exercise is recovery. If you keep grinding away at it, you're just going to break your body.

Natalya:
Thank you, Instructor Grace, but I think I still have some strength left in me...

Instructor Grace:
Hey, don't worry about Dobermann, I know she looks scary...

Dobermann:
Grace, I can hear you.

Instructor Grace:
Oh, well, you get it.

Natalya:
Yes, but don't worry.

Instructor Grace:
Okay...

Dobermann:
What do you think of her?

Dobermann:
Is she now? I don't think so.

Dobermann:
I've seen her type. They grit their teeth, fighting hard not to think.

Dobermann:
Doesn't it remind you of those three?

Dobermann:
They don't know where courage comes from, so they bite down and take on society, no matter their age.

Dobermann:
But they do seem to be ready.

Dobermann:
Yes she is. Honestly, she exceeds my expectations.

Dobermann:
An aristocratic young lady who can actually work hard for herself... hah.

Dobermann:
I do understand Amiya's instinct to keep them off the battlefield.

Dobermann:
Doctor, no one would be happy to send young people to war. Isn't the point of a soldier like me to protect kids like that?

Dobermann:
I always blame myself for them having to go fight.

Dobermann:
But I've come to terms with the fact that I can't save everyone.

Dobermann:
All I can do is teach them to fight, to protect themselves, and to get home in one piece.

Dobermann:
Think about it, Doctor, what can you do for them?

Amiya:
Welcome back, Doctor.

Amiya:
So what do you think?

Amiya:
...Yes. That's why I've been paying more attention to them.

Amiya:
Sorry, Doctor, I... wasn't sure if I should tell anyone about this.

Amiya:
You know about my ability to sense a person's most powerful emotions, and to even feel them when they're directed at me.

Amiya:
If they're not directed at me, but still strong enough, I can't feel them as clearly, but I can still sense something.

Amiya:
And the Ursus girls... it's hard to say.

Amiya:
Their situation is different.

Amiya:
At times, times that would seem ordinary to us, I will sense immense, overpowering emotion from them.

Amiya:
Of course, their emotions are different, but they share some commonalities.

Amiya:
If I had to put a name to the main emotion, I think I'd have to say 'helplessness.'

Amiya:
They are not so sad, not pained, not angry, not hopeless...

Amiya:
Maybe it's not the right word. It's like... like there's an invisible wall.

Amiya:
It's usually invisible and intangible, but it blocks them whenever they try to move forward. And they're stuck.

Amiya:
No.

Amiya:
We are in no position to help them now, Doctor.

Amiya:
What each operator is willing to tell us when they register their file, that's all we 'can' know about them.

Amiya:
They may be hiding something from us. But if so, we have even less reason to dig it up.

Amiya:
Of course, that doesn't include things that might adversely affect Rhodes Island. But I don't think Zima's group falls into that category.

Amiya:
Also...

Amiya:
I'm not sure us suddenly reaching out to help them would actually be helpful.

Amiya:
Yes, I think so too.

Amiya:
Maybe it's just that I'm a little afraid to do it.

Amiya:
Oh, Doctor, you're teasing again.

Amiya:
If only it were that simple.

Amiya:
I feel like 'I understand you' isn't worth much.

Amiya:
But people love to say it. As if it fulfills their duty to provide comfort, or that it will make someone open up to them.

Amiya:
It's hard to understand someone's feelings, let alone help them.

Amiya:
Many operators on board this vessel are the same, actually.

Amiya:
We don't share any particular experience with them, our words don't get through to them, and what we do, even if it's right, won't be what they want.

Amiya:
Right.

Amiya:
After sensing their emotions, I changed my mind.

Amiya:
Forcing them to safety may seem to us like the right move, like it's best for them. And it probably would keep them safe, in practice.

Amiya:
But that would not help them heal.

Amiya:
Doctor, I really don't want to say that time heals all wounds.

Amiya:
But I don't know any other way.

Amiya:
All I can do is respect their choice, and protect them in my own, Rhodes Island way.

Amiya:
When I think about it like that, I feel kind of full of myself...

Amiya:
Yes, but I always hope I can do more.

Amiya:
Doctor, how to or whether to treat someone, from a physical perspective, is rarely something that needs consideration.

Amiya:
But when it comes to mental health, it becomes a more difficult problem.

Amiya:
For now, I can give only a vague answer.

Amiya:
Yes, you're right.

Amiya:
If we aren't in a position to help someone, we must create the position.

Amiya:
I'm just a little frustrated.

Amiya:
Medicine is for pain, to heal wounds. And some medicines can heal. But in any case, they can't erase the pain and suffering endured before the medicine is applied.

Amiya:
I've always wondered if Rhodes Island could help some people, even if only a few, to forget, or at least let go of the trauma they've suffered in the past.

Amiya:
I've realized along the way that it's really hard.

Amiya:
Developing the drug is only the most basic first step. There's so much more we would have to do to be able to achieve this.

Amiya:
Yeah. At least we are.

Amiya:
Thanks, Doctor.

Amiya:
I'm kind of embarrassed that you're comforting and encouraging me over someone else's business...

Amiya:
Anyway, to business, I'm approving Miss Rostova's application.

Amiya:
I hope that one day she and her friends are willing to open up to us. I hope that one day, we are able to help them.

Amiya:
I hope that one day... Rhodes Island can become their now home.
