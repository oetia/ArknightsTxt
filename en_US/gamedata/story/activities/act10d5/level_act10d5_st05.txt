Rhodes Island Training Center

One-on-One Close Combat Training Room

Leto:
Hyah!

Beehunter:
Too slow.

Leto:
Really? Then why'd you block? Save the talk.

Beehunter:
Throw us in the ring and I'll have you on the ground in round one.

Leto:
I'm not so sure.

Beehunter:
How about this, Leto: You gimme another set. You land a good hit, and I give you a prize. Sound good?

Leto:
Yeah, sure.

Leto:
Take this!

Beehunter:
Yeah, not bad. More power in there.

Beehunter:
Steady breathing too.

Beehunter:
My turn. For the prize!

Beehunter:
Oraoraora!

Leto:
Mmh!

Leto:
Phew, *cough,* *hack...*

Leto:
Shura! You...!

Leto:
*Cough* *cough* *hack...* Phew... whew.

Leto:
Can you teach me that move?!

Beehunter:
Oh I can teach. But can you learn?

Leto:
It's just throwing your fists around a bit. What's to learn?

Beehunter:
It's a trick I use against those 'bugs' when I'm diggin' out honey. Does good work on the thorny bastards in the ring too.

Leto:
Really?

Beehunter:
Oh yeah. Total knockout, every time. How else could it go?

Beehunter:
If you really wanna learn, head outside and dig out some honey. You'll get it quick.

Beehunter:
Trust me.

Leto:
Eh? Nah, screw that.

Leto:
You're the Beehunter.

Beehunter:
The Beehunter's an Ursus who fights for her life. But if we're talkin' about the future? My money's on little Leto.

Leto:
Hehe, now that's what I like to hear.

Beehunter:
Okay, break's over, come fight me.

Beehunter:
'course, if you'd rather take a beating, we can do that too. I'm okay spendin' the rest of our training room time makin' you my punching bag.

Leto:
Just you wait, Shura. I'm gonna get you this time!

Beehunter:
Ooh——

Beehunter:
If you can't hit me with your fists, why not get a weapon?

Leto:
C'mon, I have my pride, Shura.

Leto:
Although, the training room weapons all have safety features. Getting hit with 'em just hurts a bit.

Leto:
You grab one too. We'll spar.

Beehunter:
Sure.

Leto:
Knucklers for you?

Beehunter:
Plenty of folks in the ring like polearms.

Leto:
Hum, finally getting serious, are we?

Beehunter:
There's two ways to deal with somebody using a polearm, you know?

Leto:
I dunno. Teach me.

Beehunter:
Sure.

Announcement:
You have——twenty minutes——of time left in this training room. Use your time wisely and prepare the room for use by other operators. Repeat: You have——

Beehunter:
Runnin' outta time. Okay, let's go!

Leto:
C'mon!

Leto:
So fast!

Leto:
Gah.

Beehunter:
Gulp——

Leto:
Gulp gulp, aaahhh——that's sweet.

Beehunter:
Don't chug so much water right after training. You'll get midnight cramps.

Leto:
That's Future Leto's problem. Right now it feels amazing.

Beehunter:
How 'bout it? You learn something today?

Leto:
Yeah.

Beehunter:
Hehe. Lay it on me.

Leto:
Never, ever get close to a boxer.

Beehunter:
The knucklers are just there to scare ya.

Beehunter:
I only came at you with my shoulders and elbows. Plus you got safety gear. No way you got hurt.

Leto:
But I couldn't block you at all, Shura.

Leto:
What kind of training did you do to get so fast? You have to teach me.

Beehunter:
I fought a lot, I didn't die. Ta-dah.

Beehunter:
Take enough beatings and you'll learn how somebody's gonna wanna come at you.

Beehunter:
And if you don't, you get dumpstered pretty quick.

Leto:
What about me? Am I dumpstered?

Beehunter:
You've got me and your sisters lookin' out for you. You ever end up in a dumpster, we'll come fish you out.

Leto:
You say that like I'm garbage.

Beehunter:
Hahaha. Don't sweat it, Leto. You're still a kid. Get some experience under your belt and you'll be a lot stronger. No question.

Leto:
Don't patronize me! I even——!

Leto:
(Muttering) I even stood up to Reunion.

Beehunter:
Huh?

Beehunter:
(Quietly) Why haven't I heard this before? You're not makin' it up, are ya?

Leto:
No way.

Leto:
How about this? Let's go wash up, get something to eat, make ourselves comfortable, and I'll tell you the whole story.

Beehunter:
Sounds good. I asked Logistics to make me up a honey drink a couple days ago. Perfect timing.

Beehunter:
And Dur-nar, I hear she did up some wild snacks the other day. Word on the street is she'll sell you some if you give her the password.

Beehunter:
Ready? Break.

Leto:
Okay. See you back at the dorm.

Leto:
Hey, wait!

Beehunter:
What's up?

Leto:
Duh.

Leto:
(Quietly) What's the password? It was always Gummy and Her Worship who did stuff like this. I dunno how.

Beehunter:
Oh, come here, I'll tell ya.

Beehunter:
(Quietly) Listen up. I'm only gonna say it once. Don't ask questions.

Leto:
(Quietly) Got it.

Beehunter:
(Quietly) Dur-nar's Snack Network covers all of Rhodes Island. But for security, you can only get access by invitation from somebody the network trusts. I usually work through Haze. She's hella discreet.

Beehunter:
(Quietly) You knock six times. Long, short, long, long, short, long. Get it?

Leto:
(Quietly) Got it.

Beehunter:
(Quietly) Then you make conversation when they open the door. When they say the word 'glockenspiel,' you gotta immediately reply, 'this one's pretty good.' Then you'll get the price and you're golden.

Beehunter:
(Quietly) Don't forget: 'Glockennnspiel,' long in the middle, short at the end.

Beehunter:
(Quietly) Get it?

Leto:
(Quietly) Got it.

Beehunter:
Good. I gotta shower. Later.

Leto:
See ya.

Leto:
Hmmm——

Leto:
I gotta go through all that just to get some snacks?

Leto:
That's a pain in the ass. I'll just get Gummy to do it.

One hour later...

Rhodes Island Dormitories

Leto and Beehunter's Room

Leto:
Shura, I got the——Hey, you started drinking already!

Beehunter:
I got bored waiting for you. But I bought lots. Why can't I do a little pregaming?

Leto:
Yeah all right. I actually nibbled on the snacks a bit on my way back. They're good.

Beehunter:
You think the Beehunter would stand for less?

Beehunter:
C'mon, let's eat, play a hand or two to warm up, and then you tell us about your big adventure.

Leto:
Okay.

Beehunter:
Pair of 7s.

Leto:
Pair of kings.

Beehunter:
Royal.

Leto:
Four-of-a-kind.

Beehunter:
Straight flush.

Leto:
Royal flush.

Beehunter:
20, stand.

Leto:
Ace, 4. Tough call.

Leto:
Hit me.

Leto:
5.

Beehunter:
Push? Okay, let's go again.

Leto:
Hold!

Leto:
Hit me.

Leto:
7.

Leto:
Hit.

Leto:
3.

Leto:
Hit.

Leto:
Ace.

Leto:
I win.

Beehunter:
I'm done!

Beehunter:
Wait.

Beehunter:
What's goin' on today?

Beehunter:
You always have shitty luck at cards.

Leto:
Huh——?

Beehunter:
Hey——

Beehunter:
Is your face red?

Leto:
Red?

Leto:
Am I drunk?

Leto:
No way.

Beehunter:
We're only three or four cans in, and this is non-alcoholic.

Beehunter:
You must be drunk on honey just like me!

Leto:
Is that a thing?

Beehunter:
Yeah! And it's hittin' you a lot harder than it hits me.

Beehunter:
And here I thought I was the only one who got honey drunk. Heh, hahahaha!

Beehunter:
Oh this is awesome!

Leto:
What're you talking about? The great and mighty Leto would never get *hic* drunk!

Beehunter:
Yes, yes, God-Empress Leto. All hail! Hahahahaha!

Leto:
What are you laughing at? If we're done with the cards then get over here and listen to the story of Leto the Great.

Beehunter:
Yes, Your *snicker* Majesty, Leto the Great. Hehe.

Leto:
Listen well, Bee——Beehunter. The G-great One speaks.

Leto:
Nnnng——

Leto:
Right, let's start from the beginning!

Beehunter:
I'm havin' way too much fun today. I gotta record this.

Leto:
Where are you going, Beehunter?!

Beehunter:
To get the Great One something to wet her whistle!

Leto:
Oh?

Leto:
Who dares?!

Zima:
Me. Gummy said you sent her to get snacks. I'm here for my cut.

Leto:
Oh!

Leto:
Sure, here you go.

Zima:
Cool. Thanks.

Zima:
Hm?

Zima:
......

Leto:
What? Is there something on the Great... err, my face?

Zima:
Did you eat honey?

Leto:
Oh, honey? N- no. Don't be silly.

Zima:
Where's Beehunter?

Leto:
She's, uh, not here.

Beehunter:
Oh Mighty Leto——I've brought your refreshments.

Beehunter:
Hey, Zima, how ya doin'?

Zima:
Hmph.

Zima:
Beehunter, come. Let me ask you something.

Beehunter:
Oh? What is it?

Zima:
What's up with her?

Beehunter:
Her? Oh, she's honey drunk.

Beehunter:
And it's hittin' her way harder than it ever does me. She's supposed to be telling me some story about her adventures before.

Beehunter:
You wanna listen in too? Or I could just record it for ya.

Zima:
Nah.

Leto:
Zima——gimme back Beehunter——

Leto:
I gotta——nng, I gotta tell her my glorious war stories——

Zima:
Yeah, sure, you can have her.

Zima:
I'm out. Have a good time, Leto.

Leto:
Okay!

Leto:
See ya, General Zima!

Beehunter:
*Sigh*.

Beehunter:
C'mon, Leto. Stop standin' in the door makin' a fool of yourself.

Leto:
Leto what?

Beehunter:
Fine, fine. Leto the Great and Mighty, get inside already.

Leto:
Good enough.

???:
Um, excuse me?

Beehunter & Leto:
Huh?

Beehunter:
What's up, Mousse?

Mousse:
Um, well, I'm sorry to bother you so late. But, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, do you think you could have your conversation inside your room?

Leto:
That's exactly what I wanna doooooo.

Beehunter:
I am so sorry about the noise. Lemme just close our door there.

Mousse:
I'm the one who's sorry!

Beehunter:
No, really.

Leto:
Nnnnnng!

Beehunter:
Phew, you're drunker than drunk.

Leto:
If you say so.

Leto:
Beehunter!

Leto:
Another can!

Beehunter:
Sure, why not? Go big or go home.

Leto:
GLUG——GLUG——Ahhh!

Leto:
Awesome.

Beehunter:
That good?

Beehunter:
Let's hear the story.

Leto:
Yeah, where were we?

Beehunter:
Hadn't even started.

Leto:
Oh, huh. Then I guess I better hike up my skirt and start again.

Leto:
Hm...

Leto:
But I should probably drink something first.

Beehunter:
Hey!

Rosalind:
Ah——

Rosalind:
I could go for another ice soda.

Rosalind:
If only that gang of nobles hadn't taken apart the vending machine.

Rosalind:
Glug, glug glug.

Rosalind:
Phew——

Rosalind:
Hm?

Rosalind:
Somebody else thinks they can make it out of the campus?

Rosalind:
The masked dudes just pushed 'em back in. Tsk.

Student A:
Hey, aren't you Rosalind from class 3?

Rosalind:
Yeah, that's me.

Student B:
We're from the Peterheim Benevolent Society. Our boss, Big Andrey, wants you to join us.

Student B:
How about it? Give it some thought?

Rosalind:
Nah. Not interested.

Student A:
Are you really turning us down?

Rosalind:
In the past two days, like four or five different gangs have tried to poach me?

Rosalind:
I don't even get why we have so many little groups. And they all have such big, tough names.

Student B:
Huh? What's that supposed to mean...?

Student A:
Woah, don't provoke her.

Student A:
Rosalind, there's kids from a whole bunch of different schools here now. Even a bunch from a noble school got sent to ours.

Student A:
You know how many of our classmates get pushed around by those noble pricks.

Student A:
Isn't it time for us all to band together?

Student A:
Andrey says as long as you come along, he'll treat you right.

Student A:
You'll have food, drinks, anything leftover can go to you too.

Student A:
Just think about it, 'General Leto.'

Rosalind:
Hm...

Rosalind:
Well...

Rosalind:
Okay, I agree to your terms.

Student B:
Awesome! Thanks for being so reasonable!

Rosalind:
Hold on a sec. Don't get too excited.

Rosalind:
You gotta get me what I want.

Student A:
Go on.

Rosalind:
Find Sonya and get her to ask me to join.

Student A:
Err...

Rosalind:
That's all you gotta do, and I'll wear your armband.

Student A:
......

Student A:
......

Student A:
We need to think this one over.

Rosalind:
Sure. Take your time.

Rosalind:
See ya.

Rosalind:
I deal with these boring punks every day.

Rosalind:
Pain in my ass.

Rosalind:
Hm?

Rosalind:
Come on, did I drink that much just now?

Rosalind:
There's no more?

Rosalind:
*Sigh*.

Rosalind:
This sucks.

Noble Student:
You're Rosalind.

Rosalind:
Here we go again...

Rosalind:
Yeah, that's me.

Noble Student:
You, you, and you, go.

Rosalind:
Oh, we're fighting?

Rosalind:
Wow.

Rosalind:
Well okay then.

Rosalind:
This is way more fun than talking!

Leto:
I never had these before. Always too lazy to deal with the shell.

Leto:
Mm, I never knew these nuts were so good.

Beehunter:
So that means it wasn't just kids from your school in there already?

Leto:
They took students from a bunch of different nearby schools and locked them in with us.

Leto:
Including the gopniks from Her Worship's school.

Beehunter:
Sorry, which one are you talking about there?

Leto:
Oh, that's Natalya. One of the Ursus girls with us.

Leto:
I just got used to calling her that.

Leto:
She's not a bad girl. But back then she was into some real messed up shit.

Leto:
We all remember.

Leto:
Hey, Beehunter, do the thing for me again.

Beehunter:
Which?

Leto:
The thing you just did.

Leto:
That trick where you crack the nuts with your hands.

Beehunter:
Gimme one.

Leto:
Here.

Beehunter:
Watch.

Student:
D- don't kill me!

Student:
Aieeeee!

Rosalind:
Coward.

Rosalind:
*Spit*.

Rosalind:
You all suck at putting out fires, but you sure are good at stealing.

Rosalind:
Wait, no.

Rosalind:
I don't have any food here either. Why are they always coming at me?

Rosalind:
They're all gopniks from our school.

Rosalind:
None of these punks have armbands. How am I supposed to know if they're with Andrey or Vasily?

Rosalind:
I'll take a few bits, just to fill my stomach.

Rosalind:
I can't keep going like this. They bug me every night.

Rosalind:
The garbage from #4 took over the cafeteria cold storage, and the other canteen went up in smoke.

Rosalind:
Drinks are gonna be the least of my problems if this keeps up. I won't have food or water.

Rosalind:
Gotta think...

Rosalind:
Hm...

Rosalind:
What if I went to Sonya?

Rosalind:
She's already got a couple kids over there, right?

Rosalind:
She won't mind taking one more.

Rosalind:
Yeah, that's it. That could work.

Rosalind:
I offer up a few cans and she'll let me right in.

Rosalind:
Good idea.

Rosalind:
That'll be a little more 'stable' at least.

Rosalind:
......

Rosalind:
Never would've thought the the world's second strongest would have to go beg first place for help.

Rosalind:
......

Rosalind:
But I'd be able to get a good night's sleep over there...

Rosalind:
Hey, Sonya, are you here? I wanna talk to you.

Rosalind:
Sonya?

Rosalind:
It's me...

Rosalind:
Eep?!

Sonya:
......

Rosalind:
Sonya? Wh- what happened?

Rosalind:
Pfft.

Rosalind:
Err, really, I'm coming in.

Sonya:
...Hm?

Rosalind:
I, uh, didn't mean... I just wanted to, err, I want to join you.

Rosalind:
Sonya?

Sonya:
Rosalind, I need a hand.

Sonya:
The ones slumped up against the wall. Take them out for me.

Rosalind:
Hey, you didn't really...

Sonya:
I have to guard this place. I'm protecting them. I can't leave.

Sonya:
I'll owe you.

Rosalind:
Uh...

Rosalind:
Okay. You're the boss.

Rosalind:
I brought you a few cans. They're yours.

Rosalind:
And I'll deal with... them.

Sonya:
Thanks.

Rosalind:
......

Rosalind:
You've changed.

Leto:
Did you fall in, Shura? Who takes that long in the bathroom?!

Beehunter:
I drank too much.

Leto:
Ahahaha! Too fun.

Leto:
Your face is all red too.

Beehunter:
You're pretty fun yourself.

Beehunter:
Huh?

Beehunter:
Look at you, you can barely talk anymore.

Leto:
What?! I've still got a story to tell.

Leto:
Where was I?

Leto:
The second fire?

Beehunter:
Fire? What fire? Where's the fire?

Leto:
Oh, oh yeah. Now I remember.

Leto:
Hey, Beehunter.

Beehunter:
What?

Leto:
That life-sized Ursus doll you got, you think you can let me hug her tonight?

Beehunter:
Sure. You can have her right now.

Beehunter:
Think fast.

Leto:
Woah, don't throw her! I can't catch like this!

Leto:
So heavy...

Leto:
Aaaahh!

Rosalind:
Heh. Is that all you got?

Rosalind:
Get up, Andrey. Where'd all your big talk go?!

Andrey:
......

Rosalind:
He passed out?

Rosalind:
Well, at least you won't be hungry.

Rosalind:
Am I right? Huh?!

Rosalind:
Okay, that's the boss down. Anybody else...?

Rosalind:
Gah!

Rosalind:
*Cough*, all right, so you can fight dirty.

Student:
Gah!

Rosalind:
You think I'm that easy?

Rosalind:
You think I take one hit to the back of the head and go down like in the movies?

Rosalind:
Huh?

Rosalind:
Ura!

Student:
Ngah!

Student:
......

Rosalind:
What.

Rosalind:
Is that it?

Rosalind:
Hmph. What a waste.

Rosalind:
Guess this is my food now.

Rosalind:
Ugh... what a headache.

Anna:
Sorry... This is our fault...

Rosalind:
Naw, we're a team. It's what I'm here for.

Rosalind:
And look, she isn't in great shape right now.

Rosalind:
So it's up to me, as Peterheim's second strongest, toAAAAAAaaaaghh that hurts!

Lada:
Just a little bit longer. Almost done.

Lada:
Okay, there!

Rosalind:
Thanks.

Rosalind:
That Youth Scout training comes in handy, huh?

Lada:
Hehe, thank you.

Rosalind:
The world's running out of good people. Lucky to have you.

Rosalind:
Really. You're great.

Rosalind:
If that cop had run into kids like you, things would've turned out different.

Rosalind:
......

Lada:
......

Anna:
......

Rosalind:
(We can't keep this up.)

Rosalind:
(We don't have enough food. Don't have enough people.)

Rosalind:
(Even with me and Sonya.)

Rosalind:
(Both the food stores are gone. There's just not enough to eat.)

Rosalind:
(What if a gang shows up to our door someday?)

Rosalind:
(Even with Sonya...)

Rosalind:
(I have to think of something...)

Rosalind:
(......)

Rosalind:
(I guess I could go talk to the mask dudes?)

Rosalind:
(No way. What if they turn me into one of those rock-covered monsters?)

Rosalind:
(......)

Rosalind:
(I might as well give it a shot.)

Rosalind:
(You only live once, right?)

Rosalind:
Hey Anna.

Rosalind:
We don't have much left in the way of rations. I'm gonna go out for more tonight.

Anna:
You can't. You're hurt. If you go out again you'll——

Rosalind:
I'm tough. I can handle it.

Rosalind:
I won't go far. And I won't take anyone's last bite.

Rosalind:
Don't worry.

That night...

Rosalind:
It's been so long since I've come here. I'm kind of excited.

My heart's really pounding.

Reunion Member:
Stop.

Rosalind:
This is my old dorm. Why can't I go in?

Reunion Member:
Do you want to die?

Rosalind:
If I was afraid to die, I'd try to find a way out of the school. No reason to come here.

Rosalind:
I'm Rosalind, and I wanna talk to your leader.

Reunion Member:
Only if you're Infected.

Reunion Member:
Otherwise, no dice.

Rosalind:
And if I insist?

I'm scared. Scared to death. But my mouth is still going.

I feel like I'm staring into the mouth of hell for the sake of my own pride.

And   I   love   it.

Reunion Member:
(Drawing his weapon).

???:
Let her through.

Reunion Member:
?

Reunion Member:
(Lowering his weapon).

???:
You, come with me.

Rosalind:
Hehe, thanks.

Why did I think it was a good idea to meet the leader of Reunion again?

Was it because I'd say a few words to him and he'd let us all go, or give us food?

Or was I gonna threaten him?

This tiny middle school student?

......

But at least...

I had to try.

......

Leto:
And... and then...

Beehunter:
Zzzzz......

Leto:
And then the little white-haired kid with the creepy smile said a few things to me and let me go.

Leto:
I can't remember too well.

Leto:
Something like, 'your suffering has only just begun' or 'enjoy life' or whatever.

Beehunter:
Zzzzz......

Leto:
How was I supposed to understand?

Leto:
Then he let me go, just let me go.

Leto:
I went back to the classroom and slept for a while. The next day, the mask dudes were gone.

Beehunter:
Zzzzz......

Leto:
Things didn't get better after that.

Leto:
We thought life in the school was rough.

Leto:
When we got out, we realized that was just the appetizer.

Leto:
Those stories, they'll eat you alive.

Leto:
Beehunter, say something.

Leto:
Beehunter?

Beehunter:
Zzzzz......

Leto:
And here you said, you said I was honey drunk. You're the drunk one!

Leto:
Cam't benieve it. You just fall ashleep without saying anything.

Leto:
Whatever.

Leto:
Where's the stage?

Leto:
I wanna jam!

Leto:
Aah, here's my stage.

Leto:
Beehunter's asleep, so you get to hear the rest of my story.

Leto:
I got so, sho mush to say.

Leto:
Phew... whew...

Leto:
Zzzzz......

Beehunter:
Zzzzz......

Dawn the next day...

Leto:
——

Leto:
!

Leto:
Why I am in bed?

Leto:
When did I fall asleep?

Beehunter:
Get up.

Leto:
What happened, Shura?

Beehunter:
What?

Beehunter:
You're gonna ask me what happened?

Beehunter:
You guzzled honey drink until you were dead drunk, then you stole my big doll, collapsed on top of her, and drooled out everything you drank.

Leto:
Huh?

Leto:
You didn't toss her to me?

Beehunter:
Feel for yourself, you dura.

Leto:
Don't have to.

Leto:
Sorry, Shura.

Beehunter:
Just wash her for me.

Leto:
Yeah, of course, no problem.

Beehunter:
I'm gonna take out the garbage. You get cleaning.

Leto:
Right away!

Beehunter:
I'm out. Don't forget afternoon class!

Leto:
I won't!

Leto:
What did I say to her yesterday?

Leto:
Probably something pretty fun.

Leto:
That's why I woke up so refreshed today.

Leto:
Gotta clean up, have breakfast, then find somebody to help me wash this big girl.

Leto:
Yeah. Not bad.

Leto:
I'll see about drinking with Beehunter again in a couple days.

Leto:
Hold on.

Leto:
Why is my guitar out?

Leto:
......

Leto:
Might as well strum a few chords.
