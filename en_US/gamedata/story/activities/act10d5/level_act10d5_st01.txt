Gummy is the second one in her dorm to wake up every morning. And she has a habit.

As soon as Istina wakes her, they share a handshake. Gummy then goes next door to wake Zima in the same fashion.

Whether 'The General' decides to shake her hand or not depends entirely on her mood.

6:30 a.m.

Rhodes Island Dormitories - Istina and Gummy's Room

Gummy:
Zzz...zzz...

Gummy:
(It's morning.)

Gummy:
(Istina should be here soon.)

Gummy:
Zzz...zzz...

Gummy:
(But she sure is taking her time today. Maybe she's been working too hard?)

Gummy:
(But I'm gonna be late if I keep waiting for her. C'mon, Gummy, just get up already!)

Gummy:
Zzz...zzz...

Gummy:
(You can do it, girl!)

Gummy:
Zzz... Nnhhah!

Gummy:
I'm up!

Gummy:
It's so dark...

Gummy:
What happened to my night light?

Gummy:
Istina? Istina!

Gummy:
Weird... Did she head out already?

Gummy:
Better go check on her.

Gummy:
......

Gummy:
Yeah, she's not here.

Gummy:
I guess she had something important to do.

Gummy:
I wonder what it was?

Gummy:
Oh...

Gummy:
What's this...?

Gummy:
'Gummy, we went out. Won't be back until evening. Please look after yourself.'

Gummy:
'Signed, Istina...'

Gummy:
'...and Zima.'

Gummy:
Hmph! Look at them treating me like a kid again. Of course I can take care of myself!

Gummy:
That means Zima's already up too.

Gummy:
Hmm...

Gummy:
Oops, I better hurry up and report in or I'm gonna be late.

Gummy:
Just gotta grab my trusty shield and frying pan...

Gummy:
Right, that's everything.

Gummy:
Time to go!!

11:28 a.m.

Rhodes Island Cafeteria - Kitchen

*Rumble~*

Gummy:
I'm kinda hungry...

Gummy:
I left in a hurry this morning and didn't have time to fill up my tummy.

Gummy:
But I guess I should focus on work first and grab some food afterwards.

Gummy:
Um...

Gummy:
Order up! Ready for the counter!

Dur-nar:
On it!

Gummy:
Gotta do a shchi next? Okay, I'll have it right out!

Gummy:
......

Gummy:
Done!

Gummy:
Food's ready! Please take it to the dining area!

Gummy:
Next up is... Mhm, we got another fried pelmeni.

Gummy:
Just need someone to take this order, then I crank out the pelmeni and I'm good to go.

Dur-nar:
Gummy, I have my hands full over here! Put that out for me?

Gummy:
Sure thing!

Gummy:
Phew...

Gummy:
I got this. It's way lighter than my shield.

Gummy:
But where does it go?

Gummy:
Dur-nar!

Gummy:
......

Gummy:
Dur-nar?

Gummy:
Weird...

Gummy:
Why is everyone in such a hurry today? I turn my head for a second and she's gone...

Gummy:
Oh well, guess I'll just ask where to put it.

Gummy:
It's gotta go around here somewhere. The lady at the cash register, that's... Gitano, right?

Gummy:
Hey, Gitano.

Gitano:
Good day, Little Cub.

Gitano:
Why are you out here with your frying pan? Do you need my help?

Gummy:
Just one thing. Could you tell me where to put the shchi? It's getting cold!

Ceobe:
......

Gitano:
Shchi, huh? If I recall correctly, it goes there in the middle, where Courier is standing.

Gummy:
Got it!

Gitano:
Are you sure you don't need any help, Little Cub?

Gummy:
I'm perfectly fine! See you later, Gitano!

Gitano:
......

Spot:
Forget it. You couldn't lift it anyway.

Gitano:
Yes, I know.

Courier:
Welcome, what can I get for you?

Courier:
Braised pork and vegetables? Coming right up. And a steamed egg with your stir-fried vegetables? No problem.

Courier:
All right, here you go.

Courier:
Please be careful. It's hot.

Courier:
Mhm, see you~

Gummy:
Courier, I got the food!

Courier:
Great! Thank you, Gummy.

Gummy:
You're welcome~

Courier:
Huff!

Courier:
Phew! That's all for now.

Courier:
Sorry to bother you, Gummy, but would you mind taking this pot back to the kitchen?

Gummy:
Okay, Courier!

*Rumble~~~*

Gummy:
Ughh...

Courier:
You've really outdone yourself, Gummy. C'mere, I have a cookie for you. You must be hungry, right?

Gummy:
Thank you very much, Courier!

Courier:
It's my pleasure. Make sure to have a proper meal after this, all right?

Gummy:
Will do!

Gummy:
See you later, Gitano. I need to head back and get some stuff done.

Gitano:
Stay safe.

Gummy:
Will do!

*Rumble~~~~*

Gummy:
(Just hold out a bit longer... It's almost time to eat!)

Ceobe:
Yummy goodies, here I come!

Gummy:
Wooaahh! Kay, you can't go in there!

Ceobe:
I can't?

Gummy:
You can't! Don't you see the sign on the door?

Ceobe:
I see it.

Ceobe:
I see a red circle with a tilty red line going through it.

Ceobe:
I also see Kay.

Gummy:
That means 'Kay is not allowed in here.' Got it?

Ceobe:
Got it.

Gummy:
If you get it, why are you still going in?!

Ceobe:
Hungry.

Gummy:
If you're hungry, you can just get in line and order something to eat.

Ceobe:
Hungry.

Gummy:
Y- You're not allowed in there!

Ceobe:
But I'm hungry!

Gummy:
Fine, fine! I'll think of something!!

Gummy:
Hmm...

Gummy:
What if I...

Gummy:
If I give you this cookie, will you promise not to go inside?

Ceobe:
*sniff* *sniff*

Ceobe:
Mm!

Ceobe:
Okay, okay!

Gummy:
Here...

Ceobe:
Thanks!

Gummy:
You're welcome...

Gummy:
*sigh*... She finally left...

*Grrrrrrrrrrrrr~~~~*

Gummy:
There's... there's still... one more to go...

Gummy:
Just hold on... just a little longer!

*Grrrrrrrrrrrrr~~~~*

Gummy:
Why's the ladle so heavy......

Gummy:
I can't even scoop up the food......

Gummy:
......

Gummy:
I can't do this anymore. I have to eat something!

Gummy has a habit. When she's famished, something takes hold of her,

And she can't resist her urge to eat...

...anything and everything.

Gummy:
......

Gummy:
What's this?

???:
The hell ya doin', Gummy?

Gummy:
So soft... Mmmhh.... It must be delicious.

Gummy:
Ah, mm....

Gummy:
*chomp*

Dur-nar:
Gyahhhhhhh!!!

Gummy:
Eh?

Dur-nar:
Gummy, why are you chewing on my hip?

Gummy:
Ah, mm, hmm...

Gummy:
S-sorry, Instructor!

11:55 a.m.

Rhodes Island Cafeteria - Dining Area

Gummy:
(Gummy is practically inhaling the bread in her hands...)

Gummy:
(...washing it down with a swig of soup.)

Dur-nar:
C-calm down, Gummy, the food's not going anywhere. And we got training in the afternoon, y'know.

Gummy:
(She doesn't leave a single scrap on her plate...)

Gummy:
(...and doesn't hesitate to reach for seconds.)

Dur-nar:
Gummy?

Gummy:
(In no time, she's gobbled up an entire table full of food.)

Dur-nar:
Guess you're not feeling talkative...

Dur-nar:
I'll get back to you later.

Gummy:
Whew. I feel like a whole new Gummy!

Gummy:
Instructor, don't you want to eat?

Dur-nar:
Sure do. But somehow all the food I brought out disappeared into your belly.

Gummy:
I'm so sorry, Instructor!!

Dur-nar:
Don't worry about it, I can always get more.

Dur-nar:
By the way, how'd you end up so hungry? You skip breakfast or something?

Gummy:
I overslept this morning and didn't have time to eat, so...

Dur-nar:
Y'know, you might just be that type of girl. With a bottomless pit for a stomach.

Gummy:
Really?

Dur-nar:
Yup, just like that one over there.

Gummy:
Kay? She's charging the kitchen again?! I better—

Dur-nar:
Relax, we got someone keeping an eye on her. Plus, they laid out some goodies near the door just in case she gets in. She won't make it to anything important.

Gummy:
Oh, I thought those were welcome baskets for new recruits...

Dur-nar:
Yeah that too. Whatever gets the job done.

Dur-nar:
See, she's done.

Dur-nar:
If we sealed that door, it'd hurt her feelings. Letting her in every now and then lets her feel like she won. And it doesn't cost us much.

Gummy:
Oh...

Gummy:
Um, so who's in charge of keeping an eye on her?

Dur-nar:
Gitano's on duty today.

Gummy:
Good choice. She's always got it together.

Dur-nar:
That reminds me, I have to ask you something. It has to do with training.

Gummy:
Mm, sure. What is it?

Dur-nar:
I notice you have trouble moving your arms, especially in quick, repetitive motions. Why is that?

Gummy:
Eh?

Dur-nar:
I've watched you in combat, and it's the same in the kitchen. You get two good strokes in and then you have to stop.

Gummy:
I guess... it's a habit?

Dur-nar:
Huh—? Well, that's a bad habit if I ever saw one. Can we fix it?

Dur-nar:
Because stopping like that on the battlefield is gonna get you killed.

Dur-nar:
But if we can cure you, I'm sure you've got the next Rhodes Island Chopping Competition in the bag.

Gummy:
......

Dur-nar:
Give it a try?

Gummy:
......

Gummy:
Okay... I'll try...

Dur-nar:
Good. We'll get to it after defender practice.

Dur-nar:
We won't know if we can fix that habit until we try.

Dur-nar:
But for now...

Dur-nar:
We gotta eat.

Gummy:
Yeah.

3:00  p.m.

Rhode Island Training Center - Defender Training Room

Dur-nar:
Last round of the day. Let's power through.

Dur-nar:
I want four sets of planks, time—

Dur-nar:
Start!

Dur-nar:
Ten seconds!

Dur-nar:
Three, two, one!

Dur-nar:
Stop!

Dur-nar:
Okay, we're done. Go cool off.

Defender Operators:
Woo!

Dur-nar:
Gummy.

Gummy:
Yes, ma'am!

Dur-nar:
You ready? What we talked about at lunch?

Gummy:
Yes, ma'am!

Dur-nar:
I'll get the training shield, and you can use your weapon there.

Dur-nar:
Now relax. That's gonna be an important part of your rehab.

Gummy:
Right!

Dur-nar:
Okay, Gummy. I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

Dur-nar:
I know you're tired from afternoon training, but it's actually the perfect time to work on this.

Dur-nar:
You get me?

Gummy:
I get you.

Dur-nar:
Great. Now gimme whatever's left in the tank.

Gummy:
Hyah!

Dur-nar:
Again.

Gummy:
Hyah!

Dur-nar:
Again.

Gummy:
Nngh!

Dur-nar:
Again! Keep going!

Gummy:
Gah!!

Dur-nar:
Again!

Dur-nar:
(If it's a conditioned reflex, that should have shaken out some more swings.)

Dur-nar:
(Is she stopping herself involuntarily?)

Dur-nar:
(But why?)

Dur-nar:
Gummy, swing!

Gummy:
I can't do it!

Dur-nar:
Swing!

Gummy:
I can't!

Dur-nar:
That's an order!

Dur-nar:
Gummy!

Dur-nar:
I order you to——

Gummy is a good cook, but she has a habit.

She chops only twice. Should she ever chop a third time——

She'll chop straight through the cutting board, right into the counter itself.

Dur-nar:
Ngah!

Dur-nar:
Nng... Phew...

Gummy:
Instructor!

Dur-nar:
I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just been a long time since I took a hit like that.

Dur-nar:
Is this another one of your 'habits'?

Gummy:
Sorry, Instructor...

Dur-nar:
Relax. I told you, I'm fine.

Dur-nar:
But it looks like this problem of yours is more complicated than I thought.

Dur-nar:
On your third swing, you subconsciously put your full strength into it. Is that right?

Gummy:
Yeah...

Dur-nar:
And I'm guessing that takes a fourth swing off the table.

Dur-nar:
If we were in the kitchen just now, you'd've chopped that cutting board into a nice, clean pair.

Dur-nar:
Here I thought we just had to push you over the edge... Turns out there's something else going on here.

Dur-nar:
I jumped headfirst into this without really feeling it out. Sorry, Gummy.

Gummy:
It's... it's fine.

Gummy:
It's my fault for being a lousy student.

Dur-nar:
Let's call it for today. You go home and rest up. Give me some time to noodle on this.

Dur-nar:
But if you want to try again, you know where to find me.

Gummy:
I could use a break.

Gummy:
See you later, Instructor.

Dur-nar:
Bye-bye.

Dur-nar:
......

Dur-nar:
(I can't feel my arm.)

Dur-nar:
(It's totally numb.)

Dur-nar:
(Those Ursus Youth Scouts are stupid strong.)

Dur-nar:
(I better pay Gavial a visit in Medical.)

Dur-nar:
(I'll grab her something to eat on the way.)

4:30 p.m.

Rhodes Island Dormitories - Zima, Istina, and Gummy's Quarters

Gummy goes back home alone.

She does not turn on the lights.

She hangs her 'shield' in the corner,

And makes her way inside.

She did nothing wrong.

And yet she is sad.

She wants to do better, for everyone who does so much to help her.

She failed.

Since coming to Rhodes Island, Gummy's 'habits' only bred more habits.

And she knows those habits bother the people around her.

But she can't change.

She can do nothing but keep on being 'Gummy.'

And Gummy has a habit.

She carries a safe door and a frying pan with her everywhere she goes.

Gummy has a habit.

She uses the entire tube of toothpaste, going so far as to suck out the last few drops.

Gummy has a habit.

When up somewhere high, she keeps far away from the edge, even if there's a guardrail.

???:
......

Gummy has a habit.

When she's famished, she has to fight the urge to devour the nearest object. Should she fail...

???:
......？

Gummy has a habit.

If she finds herself in the dark too long...

Zima:
Oh, Gummy, you're back? Why didn't you turn on the lights?

However...

Gummy has a habit.

All her myriad habits dissipate as soon as she sees Zima and Istina.

Gummy:
Ah?!

Istina:
No doubt she was sniveling alone in the corner after something shook her.

Gummy:
(Snivelingly) Was not!!

Istina:
See?

Zima:
What am I gonna do with you?

Zima:
Gummy, start cleaning. Leto is coming.

Gummy:
You got it, Zima!

Istina:
Hey.

Zima:
Hmph.

Zima:
Gummy, come here.

Gummy:
Yes, Zima?

Zima:
Come.

Gummy:
Mmm.

Gummy:
I can do it myself.

Zima:
Don't move.

Gummy:
Mmmf...

Zima:
There. Give Istina back her handkerchief after you wash it.

Gummy:
Okay.

Zima:
Now tell me what happened.

Gummy:
Erm...

Istina:
Zima.

Zima:
What?

Istina:
(Shhh...)

Zima:
Right. Forget it.

Zima:
Get to work, Gummy. I did the shopping. The rest is up to you two.

Gummy:
Okay. What's so special about today anyway?

Istina:
It's been exactly one year since we came to Rhodes Island. Zima even woke up early for the occasion. If you believe it.

Zima:
Phew— I'm beat. I'm gonna lay down for a bit. Call me when Leto gets here.

Istina:
Oh no you're not. There's too much to be done.

Zima:
Nah. I'm tired.

Istina:
Gummy, do the thing.

Gummy:
Do I have to?

Istina:
I'll go prepare the refreshments. You're responsible for getting Zima up.

Gummy:
Okay.

Gummy:
Hrm.

Gummy:
Ziiimaaaa...

Zima:
What.

Gummy:
Gummy loooooooves yooou~

Zima:
Spare me the schmaltz. I'm sleepy.

Gummy:
Ziiimaaaa~ Hehe~

Zima:
Get off me!

Gummy:
Tickle tickle.

Zima:
Fine! I'm up! I'm up!

Gummy:
Job's done, Istina!

Istina:
Good. Now put her to work. I have my hands full.

Zima:
Ugh. I just carried all those bags. Why do I have to work more?

Istina:
Call it the burden of command.

Gummy:
Because you're our leader! Hehe.

Zima:
Aahh... Damn it.

Zima:
It's open.

Zima:
Come on in and give me a hand.

Zima:
We'll celebrate once everything's done.

Leto:
Can't believe you remembered.

Leto:
Ooh, is that...?!

Leto:
My favorite!

Leto:
That stuff isn't cheap.

Zima:
My treat.

Leto:
Hehe, thanks.

Zima:
What're you standing around for? Get busy.

Leto:
All right, all right.

Leto:
Can I put this here?

Zima:
I just put that out!

Gummy:
Hahahahaha!

Gummy has a habit.

When she's happy, she laughs.

It's a laugh from the very depths of her soul.

And she wants everyone to share such a laugh.

Istina:
Done.

Istina:
Zima, say a few words.

Zima:
'A few words.' Eat up.

Zima:
Ura!

Istina:
Ura.

Leto:
Ura!!

Gummy:
Ura!

Gummy:
(It's been a long time since we all got together.)

Gummy:
（......）

Gummy:
(I hope Rosa can come next time.)

Zima:
It's open.

Ceobe:
(Ceobe pokes her head in)

Ceobe:
Is the Little Cub here?

Gummy:
Hm?

Ceobe:
There you are!

Gummy:
Eh?

Ceobe:
Hiya.

Ceobe:
I ate your cookie earlier, so I got you a new one.

Ceobe:
Vulcan taught me how to make it. It's fresh outta the oven.

Gummy:
Isn't it... kinda big?

Ceobe:
Hurry up and eat it before it gets cold.

Ceobe:
Bye.

Gummy:
Oh. Bye!

Gummy:
She's gone.

Leto:
Nichego sebe, that's one hell of a cookie.

Zima:
A cookie's a cookie.

Zima:
Well? Eat it already.

Gummy:
(I'm eating well tonight.)

Gummy:
(Yay.)

9:00 p.m.

Rhodes Island Dormitories - Zima, Istina, and Gummy's Quarters

Gummy:
Phew. That was great. But now it's bedtime.

Gummy:
Just need my trusty night light...

Gummy:
Huh? It's not turning on?

Gummy:
Did the bulb burn out?

Gummy:
Now that I think of it, it wasn't on this morning either.

Gummy:
So when did it break?

Gummy:
Uh oh...

Gummy has a habit.

She absolutely must sleep with a night light.

Istina:
Gummy.

Gummy:
What's up, Istina?

Istina:
Can I sleep with you tonight?

Gummy:
Y- yeah!

Istina:
Zima.

Gummy:
Are you sleeping with us too?

Zima:
Uh, I guess so.

Zima:
Hey, Istina?

Zima:
Can the three of us really fit in Gummy's bed?

Istina:
Just squeeze in tight.

Zima:
Guess we're making a Gummy bear sandwich.

Gummy:
Fine by me.

Zima:
All right. Just tell me if it gets too hot and stuffy. I'll go back to my room.

Gummy:
Okay.

Istina:
I'm turning out the lights. Good night.

Zima:
Night.

Gummy:
Nighty night.

Zima:
When was the last time we all slept together like this?

Istina:
I can't even remember. I don't even want to remember.

Gummy:
Me either.

Zima:
Forget I asked. Just get some sleep.

Istina:
Zzz......

Zima:
As soon as her head hits the pillow, huh?

Gummy:
......

Zima:
Gummy?

Gummy:
Zzzzzz......

Zima:
Guess I'm the only one who doesn't pass right out.

Zima:
*Sigh*......

Zima:
Settle down, brain. We got a busy day tomorrow. Ugh.

Zima:
......

Gummy:
(Hehe~)

Gummy:
(Zima's so cute.)

Gummy:
(Nighty night~)

Gummy has a habit.

......

You know the Ursus Student Self-Governing Group?

Zima and Istina?

They're the habit Gummy just can't quit.
