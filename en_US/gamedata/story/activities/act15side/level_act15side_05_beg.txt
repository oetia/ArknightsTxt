The breeze in the mountains is ever crisp and cool.

And mornings as refreshing as these are always fine for settling muddy, murky matters.

In a mountain-sat village, when kitchen's smoke has just sprung up, the snow still unreceded in spring, one old and one young stand off against each other.

The only sound, the single strike of a faraway gong.

Innkeeper Zheng:
You've kept me waiting.

Blacknight:
Tch. Bloody lout... Light, stay cool for the moment.

Innkeeper Zheng:
I've seen you before. Hmm. So it was you.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Unexpected, for sure. A Rim Billitonian, silently lurking in Shangshu since the very beginning.

Blacknight:
I can't understand you, sorry.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Hmph.

Blacknight:
Light!

Blacknight:
What—?!

Innkeeper Zheng:
A snare?

Innkeeper Zheng:
You train these slumberfoots well. An ordinary woman would be headfirst in the ground by now.

Blacknight:
(He didn't just notice the snare behind him, he stepped on the rope without hesitation... Bastard...)

Innkeeper Zheng:
Don't worry, I won't make this hard for you, girl.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Do you know what that goblet you're holding is?

Blacknight:
It's not my concern, or my interest. It's newbie bounty hunters that ask too many questions.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Then you have only yourself to blame.

Blacknight:
Don't get so full of yourself! Helmet! Drill!

Blacknight:
—

Innkeeper Zheng:
If you don't know what it is, then be wise and hand it over. Don't be used for nothing.

Blacknight:
H-How dare you do that to Helmet—! You asked for it!

Innkeeper Zheng:
...A headless bolt.

Blacknight:
(H-He caught it barehanded? At this distance?! And I *just* changed the string on my crossbow—!)

Innkeeper Zheng:
Fine.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Seeing how you're unwilling to take my life, I'll give you one chance.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Hand over the goblet to me, and then tell the one instructing you: Tread carefully. Don't be selfish.

Blacknight:
Hmph. You know who hired me?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Whether I know or not doesn't matter. What matters is I can stop you, right here.

Blacknight:
Why should I listen to you?

Innkeeper Zheng:
You have no choice.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Maybe you can run, but you could never bear to see these beasts of yours meet a sorry fate.

Blacknight:
You're threatening me?

Innkeeper Zheng:
You have skill. But aside from your crossbow, you've got nothing in a fight.

Innkeeper Zheng:
You can pull out before you're in too deep. You need a good eye and the right people, if you want to survive here.

Blacknight:
True. They never told me someone as capable as you would get in the way.

Innkeeper Zheng:
If I had someone do something dangerous for me, I wouldn't give them the whole picture either.

Innkeeper Zheng:
It's just a job to you, stranger. Why stake your life on it?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Give the cup to me, and I vow on the Escorts' name that whatever they're paying you, we'll double it.

Blacknight:
Hah, I was taking a loss anyway with all my volunteer work.

Blacknight:
Call this a favor for a friend.

Innkeeper Zheng:
A friend.

Innkeeper Zheng:
So even you bandits of the wild don't mind a sacrifice for a friend.

Blacknight:
Sounds like you've got something against us.

Innkeeper Zheng:
No... not at all.

Innkeeper Zheng:
The longer you do business, the more fine people you meet, the less friends you end up with.

Blacknight:
Then be smart, and go back to your business.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Yes, business is always easiest done in the mountains.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Three Mounts, Seventeen Peaks, hundreds of passes. Is there any road without a teahouse and station for travelers to rest their feet? Is there any road... without our people?

Blacknight:
......

Innkeeper Zheng:
I hope you see clear now, girl.

Blacknight:
You really don't think anything of me.

Blacknight:
A direct confrontation might not be my style, but you've pissed me off just far enough... isn't that right, my darlings?

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) The old todger wants to have a go, let's give 'im a go! We've been around the paddock a few times, we're no strangers!

Innkeeper Zheng:
*Sigh*...

Innkeeper Zheng:
Some just refuse to learn.

Innkeeper Zheng:
If that's your answer, then you'll pay the—

Even if a third party was stood there watching, they wouldn't have a clue just how the coming step came to land.

Simply put, the man is adept in walking passes, in climbing mountains. The steps he lifts and places, day after day after day, are truly too many to count.

In one clean noise, clay bricks shatter in the ground. Before him, dust drifts down. By his gaze is a simple, common bamboo-wood carrying pole. His gaze itself, faint rage.

Far away, the gong strikes again.

Innkeeper Zheng:
......

Blacknight:
—H-How... Where did he come from... Wait, Light, calm down! And Drill! Back to me...!

Innkeeper Zheng:
...It's you.

Pole-Carrier:
You finally came to the mountains.

Pole-Carrier:
So I came to find you.

Innkeeper Zheng:
*Sigh*...

Innkeeper Zheng:
What comes will come. Nothing's avoidable forever. Is there a need to be so hasty?

Pole-Carrier:
Hey. Miss.

Blacknight:
...Are you talking to me?

Blacknight:
(His movement—is that wooden stick one of their carrying poles? What did he do just now... to shatter bricks made of stone?)

Pole-Carrier:
Do you know him?

Blacknight:
No.

Pole-Carrier:
Then there's some problem between you.

Innkeeper Zheng:
I only see you between us.

Pole-Carrier:
You're right. I'm your problem, then.

Innkeeper Zheng:
When I'm done here, I'll come see you. But not now.

Pole-Carrier:
Miss. Does this relate to the item in your hands?

Blacknight:
Uh... it does...

Innkeeper Zheng:
This is personal business. And major at that. Stay out of it.

Pole-Carrier:
How major?

Innkeeper Zheng:
The safety of the nation is at stake! Life and death!

Blacknight:
......!

Pole-Carrier:
Since that rainy night those years ago, I've rarely heard you use such a tone.

Pole-Carrier:
I see. How could you be the villain here? What a chivalrous swordsman. What a dutiful innkeeper.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Then get out of the way—

Pole-Carrier:
—But I know just who you are, and that's why you'll never see me.

Pole-Carrier:
And if you won't, then it changes nothing if I find you. That's why I never came down from the mountains.

Pole-Carrier:
So. If...

Blacknight:
Hey! You—!

Pole-Carrier:
......

Blacknight:
Give that back!

Pole-Carrier:
......

Pole-Carrier:
......

Pole-Carrier:
It was ten years.

Pole-Carrier:
Ten years ago, you watched as my son died... so you could protect this goblet.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Shang Zhong!

Pole-Carrier:
Miss. This is nothing to do with you now.

Blacknight:
You steal my things while I'm not looking, and then tell me it's not my business?!

Pole-Carrier:
This was never yours.

Blacknight:
Hmm...

Innkeeper Zheng:
Shang Zhong, have you lost it?!

Pole-Carrier:
You're free to go now.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Shang Zhong!

Pole-Carrier:
Leave!

Blacknight:
Grr...!

Blacknight:
Mark my words, you two... I'll be back for it!

Pole-Carrier:
Zheng Qingyue... Where's your blade?

Innkeeper Zheng:
At home.

Pole-Carrier:
I see. At home.

Pole-Carrier:
That rainy night, in the escort, over a dozen lost their lives. There was a boy among them, and a father.

Pole-Carrier:
The boy was a Shang. My boy. The father was a Du. Du Yaoye's father.

Pole-Carrier:
That's why you don't carry your blade.

Pole-Carrier:
What a tremendous joke.

Innkeeper Zheng:
You still hate me to this day.

Pole-Carrier:
I don't hate you. I know you didn't mean to. The blame lies with you, but no fault.

Pole-Carrier:
'Save the goods, then the men,' hm?

Pole-Carrier:
Yet the goods are gone now, and so are the men. Am I still not allowed to condemn you?

Pole-Carrier:
I must ask you give justification, or else I cannot live on.

Innkeeper Zheng:
I will. Give me the goblet. Do you know what it entails—

Pole-Carrier:
No. He died for this cup then. I'll bury it beside him today.

Pole-Carrier:
I'll be waiting atop the mountain, for you to fetch your blade.

Kroos:
Master Shen!

Boatman:
Mm? What brought you over here? I was about to look for you at Liang's.

Boatman:
Where's young Lee?

Kroos:
The goblet got stolen. Mr. Lee sent us to fetch you.

Kroos:
Did he tell you anything about this?

Boatman:
He asked you to come get me, but not to first find Mr. Liang?

Boatman:
To be clear, you came from the Liang residence?

Kroos:
Er... yeah.

Boatman:
...*Sigh*. The fact he didn't send you to find Liang Xun means deep down, he already knows...

Boatman:
Gifted, how gifted. How truly gifted.

Zuo Le:
You're back, Uncle?

Zuo Le:
How were things?

Taihe:
In regards to her, thoughtful of etiquette, true as can be.

Zuo Le:
If she was so ready to display etiquette, that shows there's still room for mediation.

Zuo Le:
This is regardless of how she acts, or what intentions she harbors. Master Tai's instructions lie here, and they can't be false.

Taihe:
She's clever.

Taihe:
Since I visited in an official's capacity, she should have realized to some extent.

Zuo Le:
Very well.

Taihe:
Both sides are now strained to breaking point. We stand on a hair trigger.

Taihe:
We can only resolve this incident before we draw even more dispute.

Zuo Le:
If we really do want everyone to trust that our methods can forever rid Yan of the sword hanging over her head, then we naturally must obey those magic words—

Zuo Le:
—Frank and forthright.
