...Mm.

My head, poor head... what makes this clamor now... hm?

Ah... it was a folk song of bamboo, clapping away.

He shelves his game, knows not of ages' change. From dreams I wake, ask only of the years... what years... what years...

Urgh...

Why is my wine gone?

What cruelty is this.

Shang Zhong feels at the herbal plaster on his neck, as is his habit.

His ten years taking up his pole every day, climbing up and down the mountain, was his habit too.

Qujiang Peak is incontestably tall and perilous. So tall it lacks any human habitation, so perilous not a sound can be heard.

He's lost count of how many springtimes he's now passed in Shangshu. He raises his head to look afar, and at the end of a pass with no human's former trace, he sees but one person.

A person who has been waiting for him, for a very long time.

Pole-Carrier:
...In the end, we meet again.

Innkeeper Zheng:
We only just met.

Pole-Carrier:
You didn't have your blade then, so we didn't meet.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Well, I've brought it now.

Pole-Carrier:
I'll be clear.

Pole-Carrier:
I know the fault isn't yours. I also know, that rainy night, it wasn't just my son who died.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Of course you know.

Pole-Carrier:
You took in his daughter. How is she now?

Innkeeper Zheng:
I plan for her to continue my work.

Pole-Carrier:
Your work as an escort? Or do you want her comfortable as an innkeeper, like you've been these past years?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Either or. Whatever she likes.

Pole-Carrier:
Has she found a sweetheart?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Not yet.

Pole-Carrier:
A shame.

Pole-Carrier:
You won't live to see the day she becomes a bride.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Maybe we don't need to jump to the killing today?

Pole-Carrier:
Impossible. I know how you are. Your heart is heavy, but mine holds a grudge.

Pole-Carrier:
A grudge of ten years.

Innkeeper Zheng:
...So?

Pole-Carrier:
So you never planned to win against me today. The restaurants, teahouses, inns, aren't they all ways out to leave to your daughter?

Pole-Carrier:
You know the escort is a profession of wrongs. You also know the state the escorts will be in, with you gone.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Don't forget. You've gone outside the rules, with a blade strapped to you. People will sympathize with you. But by reason, you'll still be a traitor.

Pole-Carrier:
If you bore the guilt and led the escorts onward after that night, how could I be betraying it?!

Pole-Carrier:
My son walked that path. How could I not know? But your actions, opening inns and restaurants? Aren't you trampling upon their deaths?

Pole-Carrier:
It was you! You fell at a stroke, and ran from your past!

Innkeeper Zheng:
I did... I know that. But we've said a little more than enough now.

Innkeeper Zheng:
I am Head of the Xingyu Escort Assocation, Asker to the Frost, Zheng Qingyue.

Pole-Carrier:
...Polearm of the Shangs, Shang Zhong.

In early spring, twilight approaches. The trees' shadows sway, the fallen snow like silver.

A gust of wind blows, and a blade falls.

Innkeeper Zheng:
...Mm.

Pole-Carrier:
You've rested far too long, Zheng Qingyue.

Innkeeper Zheng:
It might not be my rest. Maybe you've climbed too many mountains, improved your footwork again.

Pole-Carrier:
It's hard to know.

Innkeeper Zheng:
But heroes like you are doomed to spend your older years unable to walk. It's such a shame.

Pole-Carrier:
So your blade flowed quick, the snow's gleam hit my eyes, you cut open my trouser leg, and you think now I can't walk?

Innkeeper Zheng:
You won't be able to block the next slash. That pole isn't any family treasure, you know. It's nothing but a stick of lousy bamboo.

Pole-Carrier:
......

Innkeeper Zheng:
......

Miss Du:
—Dad!

Innkeeper Zheng:
Ye?! What are you...

Pole-Carrier:
So you were Du Yaoye after all. In the blink of an eye, you've grown so tall...

Pole-Carrier:
Oh.

Lee:
You two are quite free, if it's getting dark and you still have the time to be... practicing kung fu here.

Pole-Carrier:
It's you. What are you doing here?

Lee:
I'll tell you straight, Master Shang. My friend tasked me to find that goblet on your belt. I'm looking for a pavilion, and I just can't do without that cup.

Lee:
I worry, see, since swords don't discriminate. If you... glanced off of it in your scuffle, it'd hardly be worth it when the dust settles.

Pole-Carrier:
......

Miss Du:
Dad, what are you even doing—!

Innkeeper Zheng:
...Ye, I...

Pole-Carrier:
Ten years ago, the Xingyu Escort Association took on a great commission. But heavy rains came on the way, and they were attacked by bandits in the wild.

Pole-Carrier:
To protect the goods, Zheng Qingyue abandoned his fellow escorts. A dozen brothers were killed. Among them was my son, and your... blood father.

Pole-Carrier:
Zheng Qingyue let them die without trying. Not only did he let them die, he didn't protect the goods in the end. He didn't protect the escorts' reputation.

Miss Du:
I—

Pole-Carrier:
And after all that, he even turned a blind eye to their decline, and fled from his failure. Did you know that?

Pole-Carrier:
After that, your mother left Shangshu, and went back to her home.

Pole-Carrier:
Du Yaoye... Can you swear you knew any of this?

Miss Du:
......

Innkeeper Zheng:
Ye. This has nothing to do with you. Your dad's going to—

Miss Du:
Then you're... Master Shang.

Miss Du:
No.

Miss Du:
The traitor Shang Zhong.

Pole-Carrier:
......

Miss Du:
Who the hell do you think I am? You think I spent all my life sheltered like some clueless idiot?

Miss Du:
Yeah, I knew all about my mom and dad. I know better than you what old Zheng's done all these years and how he's done it.

Pole-Carrier:
......

Miss Du:
And that's precisely why I need to tell you two today—

Miss Du:
—Association this and inn that, they'll all be Du's sooner or later.

Miss Du:
Now, if you two oldies can stop making trouble for me.

Innkeeper Zheng:
......

Pole-Carrier:
If you don't step aside, you'll regret it.

Miss Du:
—!

Lee:
If you've got something to say, say it...

Pole-Carrier:
A coin-sword?

Pole-Carrier:
You're joking. Are you going to cast some kind of magic in front of me or something?

Lee:
Ah, excuse me, now, I'm not handy in close combat at all... it's just...

Pole-Carrier:
If you really want this thing, then take it. Catch.

Lee:
—!

Innkeeper Zheng:
––Hold it!

Pole-Carrier:
Zheng Qingyue! No more distractions!

Miss Du:
—Don't touch my dad!

Pole-Carrier:
Rngh! Out of the way!

Miss Du:
Urgh!

Innkeeper Zheng:
Ye!

Innkeeper Zheng:
Shang Zhong, you've lost it! Using violence on the young!

Pole-Carrier:
—!

A clang.

A sweep of the pole holds back the sharp gleam, but without obstruction, Zheng Qingyue's blade now sweeps elsewhere.

And that goblet proves its sturdiness again, for how could earthenware anywhere take a strike from Zheng Qingyue's blade without a stroke of harm?

But with that strike, that goblet, black as the night, is sent flying away.

Lee:
—The cup!

Miss Du:
Just leave us! Go do your thing!

Lee:
But you're...

Miss Du:
This is family business!

Lee:
Fine.

Lee:
Just hold on for a bit, I'll be right there.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Ye, don't let him go!

Miss Du:
This stupid old man wants your life and you're still obsessed with that lousy thing!

Pole-Carrier:
Du Yaoye is right. Ten years ago, you lost this goblet on a mountain ridge. Now, you've lost it again. How does it feel?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Shang Zhong...!

Pole-Carrier:
If you want me aside, the answer's simple.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Tch.

Taihe:
This is far enough!

Zuo Le:
Mr. Zheng!

Innkeeper Zheng:
—The goblet's been knocked down the cliff. That Lungmenite's already after it. Move it, both of you!

Zuo Le:
Thank you, sir.

Zuo Le:
Taihe.

Taihe:
Understood.

Miss Du:
—Cheh.

Zuo Le:
Miss Du, what's your business here?

Miss Du:
I'm not letting you go.

Zuo Le:
Why not?

Miss Du:
There's been Mr. Liang and that Lee man and both of you impossible-looking mandarins, and—

Miss Du:
After all my bystanding, I've finally gotten things straight.

Miss Du:
Besides, I made an agreement with Lee. We value our promises, and that's how it works.

Zuo Le:
......

Innkeeper Zheng:
Ye! Enough troublemaking!

Pole-Carrier:
...What a gaggle.

Pole-Carrier:
There shouldn't have been this many people today. But no matter...

Pole-Carrier:
Having you is enough to settle things.

Innkeeper Zheng:
—Tch!

Zuo Le:
Miss Du, you should know we handle affairs impartially.

Miss Du:
I don't think you're all that 'impartial.'

Zuo Le:
Please, step aside.

Miss Du:
No.

Zuo Le:
Then you'll have to excuse me!

Miss Du:
—

Mr. Nothing:
Now, now, don't be hasty! It won't do for a great lord like you to be meting out such force on a young girl, will it?

Zuo Le:
—The Yin-ch'ing Fan of the Liens. As fine a kung fu as expected.

Mr. Nothing:
......!

Taihe:
Ingrate.

Taihe:
Lord Zuo, are you alright?

Zuo Le:
I'm fine.

Mr. Nothing:
Ugh! Ow-ow-ow... It's truly fearsome you should throw such vast bricks with ease.

Taihe:
You had your chance. No excuses.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Crossbow bolts! Who was that?

Pole-Carrier:
......

Kroos:
Here I am. You're looking the wrong way.

Innkeeper Zheng:
You're...

Pole-Carrier:
Don't get in the way, rabbit.

Zuo Le:
So Rhodes Island doesn't intend on assisting the Sui Regulator?

Kroos:
We don't.

Kroos:
Maybe your compass points the same way as ours, but Nian and us have gotten on for a long while. I know her character in and out.

Zuo Le:
A beast's heart is hardly fathomed. What can her character be worth?

Kroos:
Maybe not much else, for all I know. But at the very least, it's worth me.

Mr. Nothing:
And me. Dusk tore my confusion with a stroke, and gave me what I'll describe as a blunt awakening... I might like to stand to the side of things, but the occasion's fine, and I know to pay a grace back.

Taihe:
The Lien clan's Yin-ch'ing Fan.

Mr. Nothing:
You gave me a good scare last time, rooted me straight to the spot. Much thanks for the opportunity now, yes, much thanks.

Taihe:
Hmm...

Pole-Carrier:
If you want to fight over your cup, get lost before you do.

Innkeeper Zheng:
This goblet has huge significance to the Association. If I could just leave it like that, I may as well be dead, you understand?

Pole-Carrier:
You may as well be dead right now.

Innkeeper Zheng:
......

Pole-Carrier:
Good, good, good. That's the look of Zheng Qingyue. Is it because your daughter's here, or because of your escort prestige?

Pole-Carrier:
You always were someone who wanted to live on. Now our battle finally has meaning.

Miss Du:
Shang Zhong.

Miss Du:
If your son in spirit knew what you were doing today, would he be happy?

Pole-Carrier:
Don't you throw that concept at me. Even if he was alive here and now, he wouldn't be able to hold back his father!

Liang Xun:
Master Shen, why are you here?

Boatman:
I sent those few people to the top, and came back down. I thought I'd run into you eventually, Mr. Liang.

Boatman:
So you're making your way too?

Liang Xun:
It's been a while since I came. I'm taking a look around the vicinity.

Boatman:
How about Miss Ning?

Liang Xun:
She's aware, or perhaps was long since aware.

Liang Xun:
The theft in the study was her own devising, likely.

Boatman:
You'd better try and appease her, sir, please.

Boatman:
Forget all the others, you can't ever let that old Bai potter wade into the fight.

Liang Xun:
Tianshi Bai...

Boatman:
If he calls a strike of lightning down, he'll have blasted straight over the Sui Regulator and the Ministry of Rites. We don't know where the Tianshi stand on this.

Liang Xun:
I thank you for your concern, Master Shen.

Boatman:
*Sigh*... I'm only a boatman, for all my concern is.

Boatman:
I guarded the north for a few years. I chatted with the other soldiers, talking home and the times and so on, throughout all the cold days with nothing to do.

Boatman:
We all devoted out hearts to Yan, but a little foolishness here and there hardly needed to get away from us.

Liang Xun:
Such is the prudence of the ordinary man.

Boatman:
That's what I am. Aren't you too, Mr. Liang?

Liang Xun:
The land is vast and wide, all things free. Under heaven's infinity, all are ordinary men.

Boatman:
*Sigh*... What do you hope for me to do?

Liang Xun:
I hope you'll protect the peace and safety of Shangshu, Master Shen. If any setbacks should happen in the end... I hope you'll leap in to pacify the dispute, before Miss Ning and the other five act.

Boatman:
There's the old saying. Ultimately, human affairs all depend on heaven's mandate.

Liang Xun:
A shame.

Liang Xun:
This is the first adage I learned from Yan's court: 'Heaven's mandate lies in man.'
