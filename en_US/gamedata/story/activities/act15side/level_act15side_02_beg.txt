The cold spell of springtide.

It hearkens me back to many scenes of the past: my academic pursuits, my career in business, my training in the martial arts, and my entrance into politics.

In those bygone times, we were inseparable. Kind friends and mentors were always there for us, each of them hoping to realize their own grand aspirations.

What about now?

The green bricks have yet to be cleaned. Spring has long since begun, yet the snow lingers, white as pearls.

It is impossible to know what the man behind the door thinks when it is shut. All you are certain of is that, when it opens, what you know is merely what he wants you to know.

He lifts his head. The door lets out a creak.

Unfrivolous Man:
......

Boatman:
Mr. Liang.

Lee:
Liang Xun... Long time no see.

Liang Xun:
Indeed. It's been a while.

Liang Xun:
You've ventured far, Lee.

Lee:
It was a long journey, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't arduous. How gaudy of you then, Mr. Liang, to have me travel all this way just to deliver this small trinket.

Liang Xun:
All will be explained as soon as I have the time.

Liang Xun:
I must thank you too, Master Shen. It's early spring. There must be many a traveler seeking to make their way across the waters.

Boatman:
Not at all. I accepted the job, so naturally it's my top priority.

Boatman:
But now that I've brought him... I think I'll head back to the docks.

Boatman:
Oh right. We ran into a bit of trouble in the city. Lee can fill you in on the details.

Liang Xun:
Trouble...?

Boatman:
You'd best be careful too, sir.

Boatman:
I'll take my leave. The docks must be low on manpower by now. I should hurry back.

Liang Xun:
Right. Thank you for your work.

Lee:
'Make your way to Shangshu via Zhengshan, and find a boatman named Shen.'

Lee:
See how far your reputation gets you, Mr. Liang? You sent for me with just that one sentence.

Liang Xun:
This isn't exactly your first time visiting Shangshu.

Lee:
So what kind of man is this Master Shen?

Liang Xun:
Just a trustworthy boatman. And experienced boatmen can be trusted with your life.

Lee:
Fair enough.

Liang Xun:
Come to think of it, I haven't been introduced to these two...

Mr. Nothing:
(Good gracious, how did I not notice? So this 'Mr. Liang' is the magistrate of Shangshu?!)

Kroos:
(I'm getting pretty used to you overreacting to stuff you missed. What's that mean for us, though?)

Mr. Nothing:
(He's the head of the city!)

Kroos:
(Knowing how Yan ranks officials, though, doesn't that make him a whole lot lower than Wei Yenwu?)

Lee:
These two are my... business partners.

Mr. Nothing:
It is an honor, Mr. Liang. I'm Ch'u...

Mr. Nothing:
Wu-yu. Please call me Mr. Nothing.

Kroos:
And I'm Kroos. I'm an Operator on deployment from Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals, which has an ongoing business relationship with Mr. Lee.

Kroos:
We only bumped into each other in Shangshu by chance, though. Anyway, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Liang.

Liang Xun:
By chance? And here I thought you hired Messengers to escort you from Lungmen...

Lee:
So you ARE aware that Messengers exist? Then perhaps you should've hired them to run your errands instead of me.

Liang Xun:
It was no trivial matter, and the journey was long. I couldn't trust just anyone.

Lee:
But you could trust me? Give me a break. What was I supposed to do if I ran into bandits on the way?

Liang Xun:
If you thought it a hassle, you could have written back and refused.

Lee:
Please, like there'd be another chance with that trinket of yours. By the time your letter made it to me, the smugglers were already in Lungmen.

Lee:
When did I have time to write back and tell you to find somebody else? I had to get someone looking into them straight away, smashing up their hideout too, while we were at it.

Lee:
*Sigh* Fortunately, the kids working for me are more than capable of holding the fort. Otherwise I wouldn't have time for this errand of yours.

Kroos:
(Sounds like Waai Fu's MO to me... and I'm guessing Mr. Lee took this as an excuse to skip town rather than deal with everything on his plate.)

Liang Xun:
Seeing as you are Lee's business partners, we shouldn't be discussing this at the door. Please, come in. We have enough guest rooms for everyone.

Lee:
What an honor to be personally received by Shangshu's magistrate. Best we accept, then.

Liang Xun:
Please, this way.

Mr. Nothing:
You have our thanks, Mr. Liang.

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor, we were just worrying about where to stay the night, and there's still some time until our meeting. Why not get some rest here?

Kroos:
Hmm...

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor?

Kroos:
Nothing... Guess I'm just tired.

Kroos:
Mr. Lee, do we have to tell Mr. Liang about what just happened?

Lee:
Yes, we should...

Lee:
Look at the sky. It's filled with clouds. It'll probably rain tonight—

Lee:
—

Liang Xun:
...? What's the matter, Lee?

Lee:
Nothing...

Lee:
Some landscapes flashed through my mind, is all... Maybe it's been way too long since I last visited Shangshu, and the nostalgia is getting to me.

Street Youth:
Miss Du... How did it go?

Miss Du:
How did what go? That ugly old Zheng gave me an earful.

Street Youth:
What should we do, then?

Miss Du:
I told you. We can't always listen to them.

Miss Du:
If that's all we ever do, we won't have a future.

Miss Du:
Just do as I say.

Street Youth:
Alright. I'll call everyone up.

Miss Du:
Mm-hm.

Street Youth:
How will you deal with the Lungmenite now?

Miss Du:
I'll go see him myself.

Miss Du:
Some things are best discussed with an open heart.

Lee:
How about a drink?

Liang Xun:
I'll pass. I have work later.

Lee:
You had me travel thousands of li to bring you a wine cup, and you won't indulge me with one little drink?

Lee:
I went through hell and high water for this thing, you know.

Liang Xun:
Drink makes fools of us all.

Lee:
Ah, 'drink makes fools of us all...'

Lee:
One of the Liang Xun of yesteryear's favorite sayings. Full glad I am to know that Mr. Liang still cannot hold his liquor.

Liang Xun:
And full glad I am to know that you're still that good old foulmouthed Lee.

Liang Xun:
I've sent someone to investigate what happened at Xingyu Inn.

Lee:
I doubt things are as simple as they seem. If you really don't know, then no need to stir up the hornet's nest. Such is the society we live in.

Lee:
Especially when simply waiting for me to leave the city would more or less solve all our troubles.

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
Are you sure you don't need to check on the cup? The roads were bumpy. I could very well have flattened it under my posterior.

Liang Xun:
If you didn't feel it worth mentioning, then it must be safe and sound.

Lee:
Haha...

Lee:
I say you take a look anyway. I hand-delivered this beauty all the way from Lungmen, after all.

Liang Xun:
So this is it...

Lee:
Now, indulge my curiosity: what makes it so special? At the price it was going for in the smugglers' auctions, it may as well have been a buy-one-get-one-free sale.

Lee:
A rumor circulating among the smugglers did catch my attention though. Apparently, this thing was at the center of a ghost story in the village it was found.

Liang Xun:
Do tell.

Lee:
They say the cup can make the things around it... come to life.

Liang Xun:
Is there any proof?

Lee:
If there were any proof to a ghost story, you'd have heard about it on the news by now. I only know the rumors.

Liang Xun:
And what of the smugglers?

Lee:
All taken to the L.G.D.

Liang Xun:
That's good to hear.

Liang Xun:
Actually, there is another matter I would like you to take care of.

Lee:
Well, you summoned me all the way from Lungmen. You may as well get your money's worth while I'm here.

Lee:
But for now...

Liang Xun:
Hoh... It seems you won't let me go without sharing a drink with you.

Liang Xun:
We'll save business for later, then. You haven't changed, old friend. Carefree as always.

Lee:
Come, sit.

Liang Xun:
Now you're the master?

Liang Xun:
How are your days in Lungmen? I heard you're a private investigator now?

Lee:
Right... And Huai's daughter is staying with me, too. You know, Huai, the kung fu lunatic.

Liang Xun:
Ah, no wonder you asked me to look into his whereabouts all of a sudden.

Lee:
I've been taking care of Waai Fu for a while now, actually. I even went to her university graduation ceremony in his place. Am I supposed to walk her down the aisle when she gets married too?

Lee:
Waai Fu's a good girl, but she's got a terrible father.

Liang Xun:
His daughter... She's grown so much.

Lee:
Time flies, Liang Xun.

Liang Xun:
Indeed...

Lee:
I heard you took up a job in government, and with your personality and skills I figured you had a bright future ahead of you. Never did I imagine that our reunion would take so many years though.

Liang Xun:
I'm sure everyone will be happy to hear you managed to get back on your feet.

Lee:
Hardly. I just realized that some things aren't nearly as much of a headache as figuring out how to put food on the table.

Liang Xun:
It's been a while since I had your cooking...

Lee:
You're a big shot who governs a large city. Stop looking back so fondly on the tough times we struggled through.

Lee:
Instead, think back to the times when we lacked opportunities to use our talents, and make sure the youngsters in your city have them. Isn't that what used to vex you the most?

Liang Xun:
Indeed...

Lee:
Hmm, still, glad to see you're still the type to never, ever, hold a woman.

Lee:
I was worried I'd come to Shangshu only to find you'd started a family. Which would make me—

Gentle Female Voice:
Mr. Liang... You have a guest?

Lee:
......

Liang Xun:
*Cough*...

Liang Xun:
Miss Ning... I'm afraid now is not a good time...

Lee:
—What do you mean, now isn't a good time? I'm just a Messenger. I'll be taking my leave soon!

Miss Ning:
Good evening, Mr. Liang... and... Mr. Messenger?

Lee:
That's right, young miss.

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
(Explain.)

Liang Xun:
(She's a coworker.)

Lee:
(Mighty fine coworker you have over at this hour.)

Liang Xun:
(It's barely past dinnertime.)

Miss Ning:
Oh.

Miss Ning:
Might you have forgotten our engagement tonight?

Liang Xun:
No, it's just...

Lee:
Please, don't mind me. I have a few errands that just came to mind.

Lee:
I'll leave you to it, Mr. Liang. If you need anything else... Ugh, try to finish your business first.

Liang Xun:
Wait, Lee—

Lee:
Well, seems I'm in trouble.

Kroos:
Nothing, mate... We're just looking for some grub. Does this really need to be such a big deal?

Kroos:
It's not like Nian's here. I'm fine with whatever. No one's going to complain.

Mr. Nothing:
Absolutely not, my benefactor! I must apologize for what happened earlier by finding you the very finest establishment!

Kroos:
Okay... so how come we're in some empty alley?

Mr. Nothing:
You don't understand. Everyone in Yan has a handful of hole-in-the-wall eateries they hold dear to their hearts. Flavors that simply cannot be enjoyed anywhere else, no matter how reputable.

Mr. Nothing:
You savor the memories, and taste the feelings, and, uh...

Kroos:
You're not even a local... How can anywhere here be dear to your heart?

Kroos:
Now put that travel guide away.

Mr. Nothing:
If you insist.

Kroos:
Do you have some kind of four-dimensional pocket? Where are you keeping all those weird books...?

Kroos:
And you keep taking us down alleyways too... Trying to lure out the people who attacked us earlier?

Mr. Nothing:
We're wards of the city's magistrate! What do we have to be afraid of?

Mr. Nothing:
Besides, they are hardly the upstanding sort! Rather than wait for them to come to us, I say we nip this in the bud before our rendezvous with the others.

Kroos:
The safest play would be to hole up in the Liang estate and contact the closest field office to send Operators to meet us in Shangshu... Hmm...

Mr. Nothing:
I've been meaning to ask, but are there many Yanese at Rhodes Island?

Kroos:
Now that you mention it, I don't think there's all that many, but it also feels like I run into them just about everywhere. It's strange—

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor, watch out—

Kroos:
Urgh—

Imposing Man:
Such a lightning-fast reaction.

Imposing Man:
What a surprise.

Mr. Nothing:
What is this about—

Mr. Nothing:
—!

Mr. Nothing thinks fast and moves even faster, as do most kung fu practitioners.

However, the brawny man strikes more quickly than even the skip of Mr. Nothing's heartbeat, reaching his throat.

Imposing Man:
Don't try anything funny.

Kroos:
Nothing! Don't do it, mate!

Imposing Man:
Do you know your companion's identity? Did you know she belongs to an Infected organization?

Mr. Nothing:
Haha... Benefactor, to be quite honest, I'm afraid I couldn't do anything even if I wanted to...

Mr. Nothing:
What's more... This is a government official.

Imposing Man:
What a strange fan you wield. You are a master of your techniques, but you have yet to kill.

Imposing Man:
At least you are aware of your weaknesses.

Kroos:
Have we met...?

Imposing Man:
We have not.

Imposing Man:
However, it seems you two are somehow connected to the deputy minister of the Central Judicial Office.

Kroos:
You mean... Leizi?

Kroos:
Right! I saw you in our Operational Records before! You're...!

Taihe:
Taihe, Deputy Monitor Censor of the Department of Discipline and Supervision.

Mr. Nothing:
De-department of Discipline and Supervision...?!

Taihe:
Infected, what is your purpose here in Shangshu?

Taihe:
What happened at Kou-wu City? Why did Dusk leave the mountains?

Taihe:
And how is Rhodes Island involved?

Mr. Nothing:
(Benefactor, is this... about Miss Dusk?)

Kroos:
......

Taihe:
Keeping quiet, are we?

Kroos:
There is no need to probe Rhodes Island, sir. We've already gone through all the formalities... as Infected.

Taihe:
......

Kroos:
If you want to know about our Operators' private lives, though, there is truly nothing I can tell you.

Kroos:
Not that I know anything anyway.

Taihe:
Operators...?

Taihe:
A bestial Sui taking an office job? Unheard of.

Taihe:
It seems the Central Judicial Office was highly negligent in its handling of Rhodes Island.

Kroos:
So you tailed us, huh...?

Taihe:
Not at all.

Kroos:
But you won't let us go?

Taihe:
That depends on how cooperative you are.

Kroos:
......

Young Male Voice:
No need to be so confrontational, Uncle Taihe.

Kroos:
—!

Taihe:
Lord Zuo.

Amiable Young Man:
I've spoken with the other Candleholders to better understand the situation. These... Rhodes Island-related individuals are currently guests of the Shangshu magistrate.

Amiable Young Man:
They may be involved with the Mount Hui-ch'i incident, but they clearly mean no offense. We needn't come to blows.

Taihe:
......

Amiable Young Man:
My apologies. Uncle Taihe is usually a quiet man, but for whatever reason he is unusually agitated today.

Zuo Le:
I am Zuo Le, a... court Messenger. We will leave it at that.

Kroos:
I'm Kroos, a Rhodes Island Operator.

Mr. Nothing:
Chu Wuyou, otherwise known as Rhodes Island Operator Nothing. Although not yet officially.

Zuo Le:
Ms. Kroos, Mr. Nothing. Please accept my apologies.

Zuo Le:
I understand the transgression was Uncle Taihe's, but allow me to remind you:

Zuo Le:
If you are not too involved with those sisters, I suggest you put an end to that relationship while you still can.

Kroos:
Nian's my friend and coworker, and Dusk's my friend's pain-in-the-rear sister. So is that in the 'while we still can' stage or not?

Zuo Le:
To tell the truth... You've likely already crossed the line.

Kroos:
Thanks for the tip, then.

Zuo Le:
Heh.

Zuo Le:
Ms. Kroos, you're a woman of extraordinary courage and skill.

Zuo Le:
Now we have other business to attend to. Please excuse us.

Taihe:
I hope Magistrate Liang will give the Department of Discipline and Supervision an acceptable answer regarding the Rhodes Island affair.

Taihe:
Excuse us.

Kroos:
...Mm...

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor! Are you okay?

Kroos:
Haha... That gave me such a start, I sprained my ankle. I'm okay, though.

Kroos:
Nothing, mate.

Mr. Nothing:
Hmm...

Mr. Nothing:
A Messenger accompanied by the Department of Discipline and Supervision's Deputy Monitir Censor as his retainer... What a load of poppycock. They really took us for fools.

Mr. Nothing:
It seems they're also well aware of the bizarre events in which we found ourselves at Kou-wu City and Mount Hui-ch'i.

Mr. Nothing:
Even a fool can glean that the sisters are no ordinary beings, but all this is a little... uh... beyond imagination.

Kroos:
Let's head back to the Liang estate first.

Kroos:
Now's not the time to be wandering around. We need to meet up with them as soon as possible...

Kroos:
Huh...?

Mr. Nothing:
What about him?

Kroos:
Nah... It was probably just some small critter.

Liang Xun:
*Sigh*.

Miss Ning:
'Tis not like you to sigh so much.

Miss Ning:
Are you so unhappy to see me tonight, my lord?

Liang Xun:
I...

Liang Xun:
No.

Liang Xun:
Is something the matter?

Miss Ning:
Must I have urgent matters to seek your companionship?

Liang Xun:
No...

Miss Ning:
When shall we take to the mountains and see the plays?

Liang Xun:
The weather is still cold. I heard you've been ill as of late. You should be avoiding the mountains.

Miss Ning:
'Tis always the case in early spring. It makes me long for the hot tea served at Shuzhou Peak.

Liang Xun:
Right. I will go with you when I have the time.

Miss Ning:
That was your guest, was he not? You were never one to engage in small talk with Messengers.

Miss Ning:
Perhaps you might settle for 'leave the goods there. Stop wasting my time.'?

Miss Ning:
No, I doubt you would say that last part. After all, you are a man of proper etiquette, my lord.

Liang Xun:
Nothing escapes you, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
Where is he from?

Liang Xun:
Lungmen.

Miss Ning:
So far away! Ah... He came all this way to see you. I should not have intruded.

Liang Xun:
Not at all. He's not one to mind such trivialities.

Miss Ning:
My, how strange... To think you'd say that about someone.

Miss Ning:
Here I thought you would be the same aloof man to everyone.

Liang Xun:
*Cough*... I don't...

Miss Ning:
What is he doing here?

Liang Xun:
I... I entrusted some matters to him.

Miss Ning:
......

Miss Ning:
What sorts of matters?

Liang Xun:
All trivial.

Miss Ning:
So you invited an old friend from a thousand li away only for trivial matters...

Liang Xun:
......

Miss Ning:
If you will not tell me, I shan't ask.

Miss Ning:
However, this world is full of hardships. Such is life. If you were to anguish over each and every one of them...

Miss Ning:
You would only be overburdening yourself.

Lee:
Hm?

Lee:
Didn't Liang say this guest room was for me to use as I please?

Lee:
Let's ignore the fact that you came into my room uninvited. Why are you making tea? MY tea, mind you.

Miss Du:
It's not yours, it's Mr. Liang's.

Miss Du:
And I made you a cup too. Satisfied?

Lee:
So you plan to continue your accusations, Miss Du?

Miss Du:
Take a guess.

Lee:
I don't suppose you're bold enough to try anything in such a pretty mansion.

Lee:
Why don't you start by telling me why you're here?

Miss Du:
Heh, aren't you the confident one? Still carefree enough to make conversation with me.

Lee:
Well, you made tea.

Miss Du:
Alright, fine.

Miss Du:
I'll get to the point. I'm here because I need your help.

Lee:
Alright.

Miss Du:
Huh?

Miss Du:
Now that's odd. I thought you'd be more cautious. Why so agreeable?

Lee:
Liang Xun let you into his home. What is there to worry about?

Lee:
Do you know him?

Miss Du:
I pleaded him to let me in, that's all... My father's always had a good relationship with the government.

Lee:
I see.

Miss Du:
Last time we met, I was going to steal your cup.

Lee:
Not mine. Mr. Liang's.

Lee:
Let him deal with the troublesome stuff. I only bother with whatever troubles come my way.

Miss Du:
So you'll believe me...?

Lee:
What reason do I have to hold a grudge against a young lady?

Lee:
*Sigh*... All of us were young once, and all of us have had to put up an act just to save face.

Miss Du:
—W-Who's saving face?! I was—

Lee:
Did you get in a fight with the innkeeper?

Miss Du:
Heh.

Miss Du:
I'm starting to understand just what a terrifying person you are.

Miss Du:
You seem lax and carefree, but you actually know everything like the back of your hand—People like you are the most terrifying.

Lee:
At the very least, I wouldn't attack someone with a chair on our first meeting.

Miss Du:
......

Lee:
Now, tell me what this is about. And be honest, this is a negotiation.

Miss Du:
Innkeeper Zheng... My father took on a job from a court noble. They want that wine cup of yours.

Lee:
About what I figured, but earlier you were helping him with that. Why the sudden change of heart?

Miss Du:
I won't go into the details. It's just... I don't want him to succeed.

Lee:
So?

Miss Du:
Will you not believe me if I don't tell you why?

Lee:
Try not to ask questions that you already know the answer to. You want to come across as sincere.

Miss Du:
If he succeeds, it doesn't matter how big a role I played. He'll make me take full credit for it.

Miss Du:
The Escort Association has made itself a lot of enemies, and, for all the weight it has to throw around, it's stuck by the old rules even now that the Messenger industry has taken off. They're always left out for being slower to react than everyone else.

Miss Du:
That's why my father always told me to keep my mouth shut, to hide my shortcomings.

Miss Du:
He wants me to act like a frivolous playgirl who pisses away his riches. All so no one will give me a second thought.

Miss Du:
Then, I'd secretly run errands for the court, both to curry favor and win over my lackeys.

Miss Du:
Only then will he finally entrust me with the family business.

Lee:
Well, that's an innkeeper for you. Always so calculating.

Miss Du:
But I'm not part of the equation.

Miss Du:
Whether it's the Du Yaoye who will inherit the Association, or the Miss Du who's always throwing money around, both are what others expect me to be.

Lee:
So you want to take this chance to ensure your old man has to stay put and right the ship. That way you won't need to take over as the new innkeeper. Am I getting this right?

Miss Du:
Not quite.

Miss Du:
The royal court doesn't often come to the Association with a job. If this deal falls through, there is no way my father is going to hand me the keys to the Association just yet.

Miss Du:
Most people my age look to me for a way out. I told them that if my father's deal falls through, the Association won't expect anything from us youngsters anymore.

Lee:
But either way you're still waiting for your old man to pass the baton to you. What's the difference?

Miss Du:
That's nothing more than an arrangement to keep us in line. Once I inherit the Association, I will have to follow the rules.

Miss Du:
And the 'rules' go way beyond my father.

Lee:
That's why you've come to me to... uh, help you put on this play of yours?

Miss Du:
That it is.

Lee:
Du Yaoye... Is that your name, my lady?

Miss Du:
W-What about it?

Lee:
'On this silent autumn night, lingering sorrows yet grapple my heart. A long night that never ceases.' Yaoye refers to the long night from that lovely poem.

Miss Du:
Too bad, I prefer going out at twilight.

Lee:
Since this is a deal though... what's in it for me?

Miss Du:
There's somebody out there, from the royal court, who wants what you have. But you didn't let them have it. Do you understand what that means?

Lee:
My friend never told me to hand it over. Besides, isn't he a member of said court?

Miss Du:
Mr. Liang had you come all this way. He has something else for you, doesn't he?

Lee:
Only trivial matters.

Miss Du:
Whatever. I don't really care. It's just, now that it's come to this you won't be able to pretend you've got nothing to do with it anymore. No matter what you intend.

Miss Du:
I can help you. At the very least, I can guarantee you'll make it back to Lungmen in one piece.

Lee:
Fair point...

Lee:
It's a deal, then.

Miss Du:
It's a deal...

Miss Du:
Heh, talking to you is easier than I expected.

Miss Du:
Relax, I may not want to be the innkeeper, but all my friends my age have more than a few things to say about our elders. And all of them follow my orders.

Lee:
You say you don't want to take over the Association, but aren't you doing the same thing...?

Miss Du:
Times have changed.

Lee:
Right, right.

Miss Du:
I can't help but feel you're hiding something, but fine. It'll be nothing but trouble if they find me here.

Miss Du:
Uhh...

Lee:
Call me Lee.

Miss Du:
—Alright, Lee. We'll meet again!

Lee:
The innkeeper may seem a kind, amiable man, but his daughter...

Lee:
......

Waai Fu:
Uncle Lee...

Lee:
Hm?

Waai Fu:
You're visiting Uncle Liang, right?

Lee:
Right... *Sigh*... I really don't want to go on this trip...

Waai Fu:
I...

Lee:
I'll keep an eye out for your dad.

Lee:
With any luck, I might even drag him back here.

Waai Fu:
Hmm...

Waai Fu:
Thanks.

Lee:
Oh, don't be like that... Don't expect too much either.

Lee:
Yan is a big place, too big to find someone that easily.

Waai Fu:
......

Lee:
Waai Fu...

Lee:
Look, I need you to know. It doesn't matter if you're going to tell him off, hammer him with questions, or let bygones be bygones and fawn over him. If I do find him, you'll need to face him on your own.

Lee:
It's only when you catch your fool of a dad's shadow that he'll turn back to look at you. That's the kind of man he is.

Waai Fu:
......

Lee:
I'll be in Shangshu for a while. If I hear anything about him, I'll let you know.

Lee:
And... once you're ready, come find me.

Waai Fu:
I...

Waai Fu:
I understand.

Lee:
*Sigh*.

Lee:
That prick Liang Xun... neglecting his guest like this without so much as telling me his next move...

Lee:
Hm... the tea isn't the best I've had, but the pot is quite the work of art. A fine teapot, indeed...

Lee:
Hmm... A full calligraphy set too... Fairly old-fashioned for a guest room. I see Liang Xun's tastes haven't changed.

Lee:
(Yawn)

Lee:
Phew... That journey took it all out of me.

Lee:
I'm past due for a break. After all that abuse I've taken from him, I'm pooped—

Lee:
—

Lee:
—Where am I?

Strange Object:
Ao...
