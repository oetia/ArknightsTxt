Lee:
Let's not trouble our Mr. Liang for now.

Lee:
But I am curious. Are you just allowed in or out of the Liang estate whenever? Liang Xun might not put on government airs, but this has to be a little too careless.

Lee:
*Sigh*...

Miss Du:
Stop there!

Travel-Weary Woman:
(Rim Billitonian) Crikey, my list didn't have nothin' about this sheila!

Miss Du:
Hmph. Nowhere to run.

Miss Du:
Who sent you?!

Travel-Weary Woman:
......

Miss Du:
Wait, you're not even Yanese! Where did you come from?

Lee:
What's going on?

Miss Du:
Here I was thinking you kicked the bucket in your sleep.

Lee:
You're...

Lee:
(Are these beasts long-snouted slumberfoots?)

Travel-Weary Woman:
......

Miss Du:
She was clearly scheming something outside your room. You think do-gooders do that?

Travel-Weary Woman:
(Rim Billitonian) I'm not secret here anymore, so it's in for a penny, in for a pound...

Lee:
Er, okay, Rim Billitonian woman, hold your beasts...

Lee:
This is the Shangshu magistrate's land. I don't mind either way, but getting on the court man's bad side won't do you any favors.

Travel-Weary Woman:
(Rim Billitonian) You're able to rabbit on in the ol' Rim Bil?

Lee:
Roughly.

Lee:
May I have your name, young woman? And what are you paying your very bold visit here for?

Travel-Weary Woman:
......

Blacknight:
Ye Ban. Blacknight.

Miss Du:
Why were you ignoring me if you could speak Yanese?!

Lee:
You're a Rim Billitonian, but you have a Yanese name?

Blacknight:
That's not the point. I really don't end up in these situations, but I'm not looking for too much trouble in this city anyway.

Blacknight:
A hunt with no traps and no plan is a hunt just waiting to fail.

Miss Du:
Give it up. You're not pulling any schemes here with me on the scene.

Lee:
Miss Du's a temperamental sort.

Blacknight:
So you two are working together.

Blacknight:
This works out just fine, actually. While you've been focusing on me...

Blacknight:
Light, Drill!

Nearby Howl:
Wrroooaw—!

Lee:
(There's more slumberfoots!)

Miss Du:
Gah! It's got the goblet in its mouth!

Blacknight:
See you never!

Miss Du:
Hold it right there!!

Miss Du:
Hey! What dimension are you living in? After her!

Lee:
Long-snouted slumberfoots don't live in Yan, let alone keeping a cadre of tame ones as your partners in crime. This woman's probably come chasing us from somewhere else entirely.

Lee:
Hmm...

Miss Du:
What are you still thinking about? If I didn't help you, she would've trapped you to death right there!

Lee:
No, I wouldn't say she was after my life.

Miss Du:
Cool, you lost the goblet, and you don't even act like you care. Aren't you scared Mr. Liang's gonna chew you out?

Lee:
Now I've lost the cup, and your hopes have come true. Isn't that just dandy?

Miss Du:
Tch... Fine, I said that, but if this spirals out of our control, what do we do then?

Miss Du:
I just wanted my dad to suck it for once. I didn't think the whole Association would be done for.

Lee:
Where's Liang Xun?

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor, this... matter you raise... it's far beyond the pale. You'll have to let me absorb this slowly.

Kroos:
Don't blame you. I've known Nian forever, but I still need some time to take this in.

Mr. Nothing:
And you told me without the slightest reservation.

Kroos:
You're a Rhodes Island operator too.

Mr. Nothing:
Right you are, benefactor.

Kroos:
But... whether or not we agree with it, having a nation's top organizations watching Rhodes Island so closely... doesn't make for easy sleeping at night.

Mr. Nothing:
The Sui Regulator, the Ministry of Rites. Just their names alone are intimidating.

Mr. Nothing:
Yet I didn't quite pick up on any malice when they spoke to us, you know?

Kroos:
Perhaps we've taken 'Nian's household affairs' too simply.

Kroos:
Eugh. Should at least have Amiya and the Doctor know about this before we make any calls...

Kroos:
But it's not like Closure and Amiya'd have no idea about this, right...? But they agreed to Nian's requests too, back then...

Kroos:
And who knows if Lava's given the branch office a shout yet.

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor, given things are currently brewing up a storm, perhaps we should put our own safeties first, don't you think, or...?

Kroos:
We'll discuss this with Mr. Lee first. Nian be damned, but Dusk's not somebody who makes things mysterious on purpose.

Kroos:
If what she said was true, then it looks like this whole thing has a lot more moving parts than we thought...

Mr. Nothing:
A safe proposition. That's my benefactor.

Kroos:
You say that when Yan's Sui Regulator's already come knocking. Don't think safe's the day of the word here—

Kroos:
—

Strange Object:
......

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor...? What has you furrowing your brow?

Kroos:
This thing's—

Strange Object:
Ao!

Kroos:
—! Nothing, move it!

Mr. Nothing:
...Oho!

Mr. Nothing:
Wh—What in the world...?!

Strange Object:
Fphhh...

Kroos:
What? Is this some... metal animal?

Kroos:
W—Wait, that's a teapot, that's a painting frame... Are these things alive—?!

Mr. Nothing:
Where did these things crawl out from—h-hold on, has that teapot grown legs?

Strange Object:
Wrroooaw—!

Kroos:
Wargh!

Mr. Nothing:
Watch out, benefactor!

Mr. Nothing:
A fair, square hit!

Strange Object:
(Wails)—!

Kroos:
Looks like that works—!

Mr. Nothing:
—Slow down, this—thing's turned back into a common paperweight...?

Kroos:
(Damn—they're all over the place here—!)

Strange Object:
Aaaaow!

Kroos:
Urgh!

Mr. Nothing:
—Benefactor!

Curious Passerby:
What's happening? You're making lots of noise here... um, uh, why's that flowerpot moving...?

Panicked Passerby:
Waaaagh—what's going on?! What are these things?!

Mr. Nothing:
Where did this miscellany all come from...?!

Mr. Nothing:
(Oh! What did I just step on?)

Mr. Nothing:
Did this—fall out of my benefactor's bag?

Mr. Nothing:
—!

Strange Object:
Pfhh?

Kroos:
Nothing!

Strange Object:
Ao—!!

Mr. Nothing:
Geh!

Mr. Nothing:
What are you all charging at me for?!

Kroos:
There's one more!

Mr. Nothing:
!

Mr. Nothing:
That one was narrow! Much thanks, benefactor!

Kroos:
Ow—ow, ow...

Mr. Nothing:
But what could possibly be happening? Could there possibly even be more scoundrels working against us?

Kroos:
I've got this feeling I've seen these things somewhere before...

Mr. Nothing:
Erk, you're right! They practically seem an homage to Miss Dusk's Ink Spirits!

Strange Object:
Fphhh...

Mr. Nothing:
Wargh! Were there still leftovers?

Kroos:
They're all coming at the charm Nian gave to Lava. That settles it—

Kroos:
—They have to be pretty much like Ink Spirits!

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
Liang Xun...!

Liang Xun:
Lee.

Lee:
The cup got stolen?

Liang Xun:
I was careless. It seemed to be a beastmaster's tame beast that did it...

Lee:
Wasteland long-snouted slumberfoots have a special organ in them. There's some kind of hypnotic substance they can secrete.

Lee:
But none of the sort live in Shangshu. Someone skilled, strong, and in command of beasts that put people to sleep? A fine accomplice if you're out to steal a cup.

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
And the thief's not even with the inn people.

Liang Xun:
You ascertain that much?

Lee:
You're not surprised at all. You figured it out long before I could, I'm guessing?

Liang Xun:
...Hm.

Lee:
The look on your face tells me this one was definitely unexpected.

Lee:
Any immediate suspicions?

Liang Xun:
I didn't tell anyone at all where the cup was hidden.

Lee:
I think you told someone else I had it on me.

Liang Xun:
I did indeed say that.

Lee:
That's good, then.

Lee:
But look at this study. Completely neat and tidy, just missing that case you hid the cup in.

Lee:
So who can get into your study, and who could send someone to sticky-finger the cup on such short notice?

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
—Don't—Don't tell me too much. I'm scared I'll get my feet caught in your bureaucratic vines.

Lee:
Do you need my help to bring the one behind that thief to light?

Liang Xun:
Reclaiming the goblet should come first.

Liang Xun:
Moreover, hunting that one down... would be too hasty.

Lee:
Hey, little girl.

Miss Du:
I have a name!

Miss Du:
You're so slow about everything... What did Mr. Liang say to you?

Lee:
Some quite perplexing things, but absolutely not to do with your old dad this time.

Miss Du:
Tch...

Lee:
Seems our Miss Du Yaoye does like her father after all.

Lee:
You said how you were all for young against old, and how you didn't even want to take this job, but you've got other ideas too, don't you?

Miss Du:
N-No talking about me for now! You know what's happening, so think how we can haul her back in, quick!

Lee:
Easy enough.

Miss Du:
That Blacknight had real freak skills. You think it's so simple to get her?

Lee:
We're just in luck. The better the skills, the easier they take the bait.

Lee:
But what's important is, as a Rim Billitonian, how she chased her way into Shangshu. And who it is controlling her behind the scenes.

Miss Du:
She's not from Lungmen?

Lee:
I didn't hurry too fast from Lungmen to Shangshu. If she really was out tracking me down, she could've pulled things off at any Messenger station. Why wait to move until I'm on the Liang estate?

Lee:
Not to mention, a Rim Billitonian wantonly raiding a Yan magistrate? Either she's an idiot, or someone's using her.

Miss Du:
Hah. Doesn't that make her an idiot either way?

Lee:
Not necessarily. People do act naive at times.

Miss Du:
When?

Lee:
When they want something from someone very badly.

Miss Du:
Are you trying to tell me something?

Lee:
You're imagining things.

Miss Du:
Will Rhodes Island really do something just because you left that letter in your room?

Lee:
We have a level of trust.

Miss Du:
Do you know them that well?

Lee:
Good people always know each other well.

Kroos:
His door's open... but where's Mr. Lee?

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor, there's two letters here. It seems one's meant for us.

Kroos:
Let's see...

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor, I admit I've been holding in my curiosity. Just what kind of person is this Brother Lee?

Kroos:
...Err.

Kroos:
He's a detective. Had dealings with Rhodes Island since a while ago now... well, mainly the kids from his agency have.

Kroos:
But little by little, him and us have gotten familiar.

Mr. Nothing:
I see, a detective... no wonder he's so meticulously minded. By his wardrobe, I would've guessed him to be some manner of tianshi with a mild hand for Originium Arts.

Mr. Nothing:
What did Brother Lee write, then?

Kroos:
Says...

Kroos:
Read it for yourself.

Mr. Nothing:
'Cup was taken. Find Master Shen at ferry crossing,' and...

Mr. Nothing:
W... Well, he really hasn't taken us for outsiders. Master Shen would be that boatman of some admittedly suspicious intrigue, no?

Kroos:
If we don't get this sorted properly, Rhodes Island can kiss goodbye to not getting involved. Better we listen to Mr. Lee for now.

Kroos:
He predicted this situation'd get more complex, so that's why he didn't want us involved at the beginning... Does this really mean he saw all this coming?

Lee:
......

Miss Du:
How come you're out of things to say now? Really? We haven't run that far yet.

Miss Du:
And can you tell me how you know they're gonna listen to your letter at all?

Lee:
If I start telling a youngster like you, Miss Du, it'll be your fault when you get bored.

Miss Du:
You love pretending you're so mature... That's why I hate all you kung fu nutjobs.

Lee:
You've got the wrong idea there. I run a licensed detective agency.

Miss Du:
Does being the boss of one guarantee you're a detective?

Lee:
Er...

Miss Du:
What, you're wasting all this effort just to find this goblet's owner and nothing else? You swear?

Lee:
Of course there's more. I want my own answers, too.

Miss Du:
Y-You know, if what you say is true, couldn't that Blacknight bandit seriously just leave Shangshu?

Lee:
A thief with knowledge of how Magistrate Liang's study is laid out? She must be somewhere nearby, off to meet her puppet master.

Miss Du:
And on the off chance she scrams?

Lee:
If a Rim Billitonian can get out safely after stealing the magistrate's property, then someone wants her leaving—or to put it the other way around, she's going absolutely nowhere.

Miss Du:
Guaranteed?

Lee:
Not that guaranteed, actually. It'll just be a gamble.

Miss Du:
Then we're too late then, aren't we?!

Lee:
If worst comes to worst and she did scarper on us, then with your help, we'll just get her back.

Miss Du:
Easy for you to say! How am I meant to know which way she went?

Lee:
Well, if they've come prepared, then how do you find a single person in a Shangshu-sized haystack? Is one pair of eyes and one pair of legs going to do the trick for you, Miss Du?

Miss Du:
Then what can... wait...

Lee:
It's not me who wants that lousy goblet, either.

Lee:
Someone's stolen it? Brilliant. We'll go see just what fins those anglers are trying to fish up with it.

Miss Du:
Do you already have guesses for who they are...?

Lee:
All I'll do is ask is that you all take your seats.

Miss Ning:
Very rare you should call for me so early in the morning, my Lord.

Liang Xun:
Miss Ning...

Miss Ning:
The camellias in the roadside garden have bloomed. Have you seen them?

Liang Xun:
You were the one who planted them.

Miss Ning:
Yes, much thanks to your tender care for them.

Miss Ning:
You truly let your own garden run wild. 'Tis become a means for me to kill my time.

Miss Ning:
I will sprinkle a few red plums next time, then.

Liang Xun:
As you wish.

Miss Ning:
Why such agitation, my Lord?

Liang Xun:
There's something I wish to consult you on, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
......

Liang Xun:
......

Miss Ning:
Well, will you say it? Since when could you no longer say things straight, Liang Xun?

Liang Xun:
It's to do with that friend of mine.

Miss Ning:
Do you not trust me?

Liang Xun:
I have always trusted you, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
Really? If so, why do you ask to confirm before you speak?

Liang Xun:
Er. You are completely right...

Miss Ning:
Though I do not mind the walk to see you, 'twould not be just to ask me some questions that you called for me, so rare that is?

Liang Xun:
If I have displeased you, I humbly apologize.

Miss Ning:
Haha. Why the nervousness? Am I so frightening?

Liang Xun:
......

Miss Ning:
Yesterday morning, I went to old Zhao's jewelers', and had repairs on the bracelet you gave me. At noon, I went to Miss Wen's shop to pick furniture; I have long wanted a larger dining table...

Miss Ning:
After, I went with Miss Wen to meet her husband at the dock.

Miss Ning:
In the afternoon, we ate our meal at Chef Hu's, talked of everyday domestics...

Liang Xun:
......

Miss Ning:
Finally, I went to Uncle Bai's, watched him teach his potter apprentices, and went on a stroll with him.

Miss Ning:
Is there anything you still wanted to ask, my Lord?

Liang Xun:
The bracelet I gave you was just an ordinary silver one. It's not of great worth.

Miss Ning:
Really, may I not like it if it is not of great worth?

Liang Xun:
I hear Uncle Bai has had a cold the last few days. He's admittedly getting on in years; he's at the point he should be minding his health.

Miss Ning:
He will.

Miss Ning:
But Uncle Bai has been pottering in Shangshu for ten years now, every afternoon and for six hours. Thunder could not move him.

Miss Ning:
Habits become nature; there will be no exhorting him now.

Liang Xun:
You met all five of them, throughout all of yesterday?

Miss Ning:
'Tis routine matters.

Liang Xun:
I understand now.

Miss Ning:
So, now you have finished questioning me, you shall next be heading out, my Lord, shall you not?

Liang Xun:
It's almost daybreak.

Miss Ning:
'Tis early to be visiting the theater, no?

Liang Xun:
Not a suitable time, indeed.

Miss Ning:
And you know my body is frail...

Liang Xun:
I will go and brew some tea, then. You wait.

Miss Ning:
Mm.

Liang Xun:
Oh, yes. Miss Ning, the book you borrowed yesterday from my study... have you finished reading it?

Miss Du:
It's day now.

Lee:
But the snow still hasn't melted.

Lee:
I have something I need to ask you too.

Miss Du:
What?

Lee:
Do you see these... little whatsits multiplying?

Strange Object:
Phhh... ao!

Miss Du:
What is this?

Strange Object:
Fphhh...

Lee:
......

Lee:
If these things appear because of that goblet...

Lee:
Then that means we bet on the right street.

Blacknight:
(...They haven't followed me? I'm finding this too easy.)

Blacknight:
(Let's see this letter... that storyteller has seemingly changed profession? Pottery? Pottery what...)

???:
Where are you going?

Blacknight:
—Who is that?!

Innkeeper Zheng:
Why is that 'unaccounted-for' goblet in your grasp?

Ink Spirit:
Gkh...

Strange Object:
Ao?

Ink Spirit:
Gkh...?!

Strange Object:
Wrrao!

Ink Spirit:
Gkh... gkh...?

Ink Spirit:
Gkh...

Strange Object:
Ao...

Dusk:
......

Dusk:
So you *are* here.
