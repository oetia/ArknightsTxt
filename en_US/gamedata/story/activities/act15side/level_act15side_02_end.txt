'The Shangshu Mountains are full of walkways, winding through its steep peaks among the clouds.'

A conspicuous sign stands here. The sign itself is new, and so are the letters written upon it. The words, however, are old.

The mountain is old, and so are the stone steps. The cable cars and the people, however, are all new.

I scratch my head and am surprised to find my hair less of a damp mess than expected. It is as though some indescribable sensation is enlightening my entire body and soul.

All one's vivid daytime memories quickly fade away. Yet, they thoughtfully drift back when needed.

I decide to make my way up.

I am not sure why I do so, but even if these steps took me immediately heavenward, I would still ascend.

As if in response to my sincerity, I find yet another sign around the corner.

A new sign, this time accompanied by new words. It resembles one that advertises scenic spots for tourists.

'Zuanjiang Peak'

Lee:
Zuanjiang Peak... Is that where I am?

Lee:
Hello—Anybody home—

Lee:
......

Faint Echo:
Hello... Anybody home...

Lee:
Fine. Now that I'm here, might as well make the best of this.

Lee:
(There seems to be a pavilion in the distance.)

Lee:
(Strange... I feels like I've seen this place before...)

Snowsweeping Stranger:
We don't often get visitors here. Are you heading to the pavilion?

Lee:
Oh, no... I'm just going to take a peek.

Lee:
What is this place...?

Snowsweeping Stranger:
Zuanjiang Peak.

Lee:
One of Shangshu's Three Mounts and Seventeen Peaks?

Snowsweeping Stranger:
Eighteen, not Seventeen.

Snowsweeping Stranger:
The path to the pavilion isn't an easy one. Someone must have had a lot of free time to build it up there.

Lee:
Looks like there's somebody up there though...?

Snowsweeping Stranger:
Of course. Why else would you build a pavilion?

Lee:
And you're sweeping snow here?

Snowsweeping Stranger:
Correct.

Lee:
There's nobody here.

Snowsweeping Stranger:
They'll only come after the snow is cleared.

Lee:
Who will?

Snowsweeping Stranger:
Who knows, but you're here now, aren't you?

Snowsweeping Stranger:
Isn't the one at the pavilion beckoning you?

Lee:
Oh...?

Snowsweeping Stranger:
Watch your step.

Snowsweeping Stranger:
The path is slippery when it's snowy.

Miss Du:
Is everyone here?

Street Youth:
Correct.

Street Youth:
The masters won't let us in on the fun, and the innkeeper is always busy with his customers. The only ones missing are those still sitting around waiting for table scraps.

Feeble Apprentice:
Are you sure we don't have to listen to I-Innkeeper Zheng...? Can we back out?

Street Youth:
Huh? You still wanna follow him? Might as well quit martial arts and work as one of his cooks!

Street Youth:
All the logistics companies have gotta be swimming in dough, with how busy they are. But, no, the old man is so in love with his rules that he'd rather open a restaurant than compete! He must be senile or something!

Feeble Apprentice:
To Innkeeper Zheng, a restaurant is an upstanding business, while attaching the word 'logistics' to the Xingyu name would merely sully the Association. He'd never accept that.

Street Youth:
And why does he think that?

Feeble Apprentice:
How would I know?

Miss Du:
We all know old man Zheng's scared of everything these days. After all those years running the Escort Association, only now when he's about to kick the bucket does he realize how many people he's offended for nothing.

Miss Du:
At this rate, the Association is done for, with or without anyone kicking down our doors.

Street Youth:
But this is a huge job from the court, right? You sure it's okay to screw it up on purpose?

Miss Du:
This will only work because it's a huge job. I know what I'm doing.

Distant Shout:
Help! Thief!

Distant Shout:
Don't let him get away!

Street Youth:
Uh... is that part of your plan too, Miss Du?

Miss Du:
Of course not! Let's go!

Miss Ning:
It seems your friend is asleep.

Liang Xun:
Well, it's getting awfully late...

Miss Ning:
After nothing but small talk?

Miss Ning:
Then what of the play...?

Liang Xun:
We'll discuss this another time. You should rest. Try not to go outside so often.

Liang Xun:
You need to take care of yourself.

Miss Ning:
I visit because there are matters more pressing to me than my health.

Liang Xun:
You mean the plays...?

Miss Ning:
Mm-hm.

Liang Xun:
I can't leave while I still have duties to attend to.

Miss Ning:
Is that your way of berating me for idling about all day?

Liang Xun:
Of course not.

Distant Shout:
Help! Thief!

Liang Xun:
Hm... A thief?

Miss Ning:
How bizarre... A thief at the Liang estate?

Liang Xun:
You head on inside. I will take a look.

Miss Ning:
......

Liang Xun:
What is going on here?

Mr. Nothing:
Oh, Mr. Liang. I just arrived myself.

Liang Xun:
You two are Lee's guests, and that makes you my guests as well. As your host, I apologize for the disturbance.

Part-Timer:
M-Mr. Liang. I was just preparing to leave for the day, when all of a sudden I saw a silhouette up on the wall...

Liang Xun:
A silhouette?

Part-Timer:
Y-Yes, and it looked like it was holding a box...

Liang Xun:
......!

Liang Xun:
To Lee's room! Hurry!

Lee:
The lady sweeping snow was right, it was a difficult climb. And now that I made it, the person I saw is gone.

Lee:
Hey, are you still here—?

Lee:
What is this place anyway...?

Lee:
Why did you summon me here?

Lee:
I did?

Lee:
I...

Lee?:
Right...

Lee?:
I'm here... to reminisce with you, about the old days.

Lee?:
I'll pass... There's no suspense to it, much less any enjoyment.

Lee?:
I'm here to give you a small gift.

Lee?:
Only a few decades. Like the snap of a finger.

Lee?:
A pair, one black and one white, like light and shadow coexisting in harmony.

Lee?:
Pick one, and I'll keep the other.

Lee?:
What's the matter? Not to your liking?

Lee?:
I am, yet also not.

Lee?:
Besides, I didn't exactly have a choice—

Lee:
—!

Lee:
Hm... Was that... all a dream?

Liang Xun:
Are you okay?

Lee:
I'm not so old that you need to worry about me kicking the bucket in my sleep... What's the matter?

Mr. Nothing:
Sir, someone just spotted a thief making off with a case that looked just like yours!

Liang Xun:
Is the case gone?

Lee:
You mean the wine cup...? Don't worry. It's right here.

Liang Xun:
How did you...?

Lee:
The box only contains an ordinary teapot I took from the cupboard, painted black with ink.

Lee:
I'm not stupid enough to leave it out in the open, knowing someone is after it.

Mr. Nothing:
My good man, you are every bit the cunning genius that Kroos described.

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
Mr. Liang.

Lee:
Someone out there is bold enough to provoke the magistrate for an old antique. If every thief were this brazen, the L.G.D. would only need to guard street food stands.

Lee:
So isn't it time you told me what this is about?

Liang Xun:
I will tell you everything you need to know.

Liang Xun:
Which also coincides with the other matter I need your help with.

Liang Xun:
Find its owner.

Lee:
I see... Some actual detective work this time.

Lee:
Before that though... Mr. Nothing, where's that benefactor of yours, Kroos?

Mr. Nothing:
Uh... D-Did she chase after them?!

Mr. Nothing:
I'll go check on her!

Kroos:
......

Kroos:
(I followed them all the way to this night market, but isn't it a bit too lively?)

Kroos:
(Did I lose 'em?)

Kroos:
(Let me check this direction...)

Kroos:
Oops, my bad—

Miss Du:
—You're from this afternoon—

Kroos:
......

Miss Du:
I don't suppose you'd believe me if I said I had nothing to do with this?

Kroos:
I haven't even said anything yet.

Kroos:
But put yourself in my shoes. Soon as I arrive in Shangshu, I run into someone trying to rob a friend. And now again. Would YOU believe that's a coincidence?

Kroos:
Don't worry though, I'll give you plenty of time to work out your excuse.

Miss Du:
Hmph.

Miss Du:
Might as well save my breath, then!

Lee:
I'll go this way. You check over there.

Mr. Nothing:
Right then! I'm counting on you, Brother Lee.

Lee:
Hold on.

Mr. Nothing:
Is something the matter?

Lee:
What's that... beside your feet?

Mr. Nothing:
Hm? I don't see anything.

Lee:
......

Lee:
Must be my eyes playing tricks... Maybe someone's pet?

Lee:
Let's go.

Strange Object:
......
