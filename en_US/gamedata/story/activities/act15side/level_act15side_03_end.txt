Midday. The skies are clear, as though the heavy rains the night before had been nothing but a lie.

The second tallest of Shangshu's Three Mounts is Mount Juqi. Juqi is home to only two of the Seventeen Peaks, the lesser of which is Nini Peak.

There are twenty two hundred and twenty two steps leading up to Nini Peak. While this may seem like a fascinating coincidence, additional steps were added specifically for the gimmick.

The steps lead heavenward through the clouds. The higher you get, the fewer visitors can be found. A lush, green mountain, rarely ever trodden by footsteps.

A few men can be seen here and there; all of them appear to be pole-carriers on first glance.

Teahouse Stopperby:
This is no Mount T'ien, but truly, what a fine summit.

Teahouse Stopperby:
How do you suppose they built a teahouse up here in the mountains, when the roads aren't so much as paved?

Teahouse Tourist:
Hmm. By hand. How else?

Teahouse Tourist:
On our way up here, we saw a pole-carrier walking down the mountain, didn't we? They do this every day, carrying anything from foodstuffs to bricks up from the base of the mountain.

Teahouse Tourist:
From what I hear, a single trip takes them a good few hours. It's very toilsome work. Even today, some remote mountains still rely on pole-carriers for their survival...

Teahouse Stopperby:
Can't they build a ropeway for some cable cars or something?

Teahouse Tourist:
First they'd need a plot of land to build it on, wouldn't they?

Teahouse Stopperby:
Right, not that I know the first thing about building ropeways... Those guys really are amazing, though.

Teahouse Stopperby:
They probably rake in quite a bit dough, don't they?

Teahouse Tourist:
Not until recently. I saw on the news not too long ago that the Shangshu magistrate thinks very highly of the coolies. The government's even footing the bill for the teahouses' tea... Uhh?

Pole-Carrier:
Pardon... 'Scuse me.

Pole-Carrier:
Noon tea.

Teahouse Assistant:
You got it, Master Shang.

Teahouse Assistant:
Haven't seen you for a couple days. How've you been?

Pole-Carrier:
Same old.

Teahouse Assistant:
What were you up to?

Pole-Carrier:
Saw my son.

Teahouse Assistant:
Oh... It's that time again... I'd forgotten.

Teahouse Assistant:
If you'd told me sooner, we could've gone together.

Pole-Carrier:
Don't worry about it...

Pole-Carrier:
He likes it quiet.

Teahouse Assistant:
*Sigh*... It's been years now... I'm only saying this because we know each other so well, and I mean no disrespect, but well...

Teahouse Assistant:
We can't be stuck in the past.

Pole-Carrier:
You speaking for Zheng Qingyue?

Teahouse Assistant:
Come on, you know he personally invested in all the teahouses here.

Pole-Carrier:
You're on his payroll. You speak for him. No offense taken.

Teahouse Assistant:
That's half my own opinion too.

Pole-Carrier:
Half-offended then.

Teahouse Assistant:
It's been years already. Just hear me out.

Teahouse Assistant:
Have some tea and think it through.

Pole-Carrier:
......

Teahouse Stopperby:
Isn't that the man we saw go down the mountain earlier...?

Teahouse Tourist:
I-I think so? It hasn't been that long, has it? He's back already?

Teahouse Tourist:
He and his buddies must have some kind of relay system so he only has to go down halfway. That's the only plausible explanation.

Kroos:
No good... Can't get through to 'em.

Kroos:
There's no response, which means Nian and Dusk aren't in Shangshu yet... They might not be following the mission directives.

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor...

Kroos:
Yeah, I know what you're about to say.

Mr. Nothing:
I'm hardly a clever man, and I certainly can't claim to remember everything I see, but if my eyes did not deceive me...

Mr. Nothing:
The case that Mr. Lee handed to Mr. Liang... carried the same pattern as the trinket that Nian had.

Kroos:
Must have something to do with them suddenly breaking off from the team.

Mr. Nothing:
What should we do?

Kroos:
Hm... Well, I kind of saw this coming too.

Kroos:
I talked to Lava, you see. Asked her to contact the Operators near Shangshu and have them come get us as soon as she made it to the office.

Mr. Nothing:
Oh? So you came prepared?

Kroos:
Nian was acting awfully dodgy the whole way. I figured she was up to something.

Mr. Nothing:
Are you suggesting we stay here for the time being then?

Kroos:
We bumped into Mr. Lee. Naturally we have to help him. It's in the contract and everything.

Mr. Nothing:
I see. You'll handle this fairly and impartially, while remaining vigilant and conscientious. You continue to command my utmost respect, benefactor.

Kroos:
But Mr. Lee's a smart man... He never bothered requesting Rhodes Island's assistance ever since we ran into him at the inn. Maybe he's been trying to tell us not to get involved.

Kroos:
If this really does have to do with Nian, though... Not to mention Taihe and Zuo Le...

Kroos:
Anyway, we'll check out the rendezvous point when the time comes. Nian's probably gonna be a no-show, but Dusk isn't that kind of girl. We might see her there.

Mr. Nothing:
Right. Dusk is likely to drop a hint or two, at least.

Kroos:
*Sigh*.

Kroos:
No matter how I slice it, though, sometimes things are just too—

Mr. Nothing:
—Too coincidental?

Kroos:
Nothing, mate, you didn't have any particular reason for choosing that inn, right?

Mr. Nothing:
Oh, you jest. Suppose I had an ulterior motive, how could I have counted on a Gloompincer knocking my car over and then us running into each other?

Kroos:
Then just who is it that made everything line up so perfectly?

Kroos:
Oh...

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor... that WAS a jest, right? A joke, a jape? You couldn't possibly be suspecting me, could you? Benefactor?!

Miss Du:
Dad.

Innkeeper Zheng:
What's the matter...?

Miss Du:
I thought I was in charge of this whole thing?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Someone has to clean up the mess.

Miss Du:
......!

Miss Du:
If you can do it, then clearly I could too—

Innkeeper Zheng:
Wrong.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Even if you could, you can't. As long as you're still Du Yaoye and not Du, Head of the Escort Association, there is absolutely no way.

Miss Du:
Why?!

Innkeeper Zheng:
Do you still fail to realize why I didn't seize the target when he was at the inn? Why I stopped you, even?

Miss Du:
It was because of that Cautus with the skills, and that Nothing dude—

Innkeeper Zheng:
It seems you still have much to learn.

Miss Du:
What do you mean...?

Innkeeper Zheng:
You have no eye for people.

Miss Du:
Dad!

Miss Du:
Do you want me to inherit the Association, or do you want me to be the naive Miss Du my whole life?!

Innkeeper Zheng:
An escort has many enemies. You don't understand.

Miss Du:
And so I should continue to be the stupid, ignorant daughter of the Association's head?

Miss Du:
I'm supposed to let everyone think that Zheng, Head of the Escort Association, is now just an honest businessman, and I'm a successor who's not up to snuff?

Miss Du:
You know that's not who I am.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Ye, my girl...

Miss Du:
Do you know the size of the bone the young people at the Escort Association have to pick with you?

Innkeeper Zheng:
What do they know?

Miss Du:
And what do you know?

Innkeeper Zheng:
......

Miss Du:
You're trying to wash your hands of the business, yet you don't even realize how long the younger generation has been unhappy with the current state of the Association.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Then are you telling me, in all honesty, that starting a new association with those inexperienced disciples is what you truly want?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Is that who you are now?

Miss Du:
All I know is that you made me do this, Dad. And that if I succeed, not only will they all bow down to me, I'll have a fine new addition to my rap sheet.

Innkeeper Zheng:
I'm worried that you might not have what it takes.

Innkeeper Zheng:
And I'm even more worried that you're actually trying to mess this up.

Miss Du:
I don't know what you're talking about...

Miss Du:
If you've changed your mind, then hurry up and tell me. And if you haven't, then...

Miss Du:
Stop worrying about me.

Street Youth:
How did it go, Miss...? What did the innkeeper say?

Miss Du:
Hmph, how do you think it went?

Miss Du:
Zheng got played. They switched it out with a decoy.

Street Youth:
At least we don't have to screw this one up ourselves. Sounds like he's already on top of it.

Miss Du:
Not necessarily.

Miss Du:
He knows what we're up to.

Street Youth:
H-Huh?

Street Youth:
He knows? What should we do, then? If our masters ground us, we can't do nothing!

Miss Du:
Solving a problem like this can take a while, but creating a new one is simple enough.

Lee:
I had this same thought when I first visited Shangshu years ago, but the people here are really quite something.

Lee:
From Xinluan to Liuyun, how many wondrous peaks and precipitous paths will we have to cross? The city is dispersed along the mountain chain, and there are settlements scattered all across. What a wondrous sight.

Boatman:
So... have you come to understand why you came to be robbed?

Lee:
I'm not stupid.

Lee:
Though I trust Liang Xun, and therefore I trust you, Master Shen.

Boatman:
*Sigh*... Well, you've got smarts, I'll give you that.

Lee:
Is that what Liang Xun said about me?

Boatman:
I came to that conclusion myself. Where does Mr. Liang come into this?

Lee:
He once told me that I put up a front and my predictions never come true, but I have a good eye for people.

Boatman:
That's what I meant.

Lee:
It's all a matter of experience.

Boatman:
Let's go. This is as high as Huntan Peak gets, and we haven't seen any pavilions on our way up here.

Boatman:
Qujiang Peak isn't far from here, but why pick that one? If we're looking for someone, shouldn't we start where more people live?

Lee:
What did they used to call Qujiang?

Boatman:
Zuanjiang Peak. It was difficult to write, so they changed it when it got turned into a tourist spot.

Lee:
Bingo.

Lee:
I had a dream that I was looking for someone on the peak.

Boatman:
Now if that isn't strange... Sure you didn't learn about the old name on your last trip to Shangshu?

Lee:
Maybe... Or perhaps...

Lee:
...I have a mountain spirit guiding me.

Boatman:
You know how to use Arts, right?

Boatman:
Think they call 'em Originium Arts now? An inkhorn of a name, I tell you, but they've always been around, and may as well be the gods and spirits you speak of.

Lee:
Now that's not quite right, Master Shen. It is man who uses Fulu, and thus it is man who triumphs over nature.

Lee?:
'It is man who triumphs over nature'?

Lee?:
I think I like that saying.

Lee:
......!

Boatman:
Alright, alright. Originium Arts it is. I don't really get these Originium studies... Hm? What are you spacing out for?

Lee:
Did I... Did I just say something...?

Boatman:
'Man who triumphs over nature'?

Lee:
No...

Lee:
Never mind... I was probably daydreaming.

Liang Xun:
Qujiang Peak... Zuanjiang Peak.

Liang Xun:
We looked there numerous times, but the search always came up emptyhanded.

Taihe:
Naturally.

Liang Xun:
Yet the Sui Regulator has nonetheless come to a decision.

Taihe:
Yes.

Liang Xun:
Has her presence in Shangshu all these years ever proven to be a transgression, though?

Taihe:
......

Liang Xun:
Why, then, did she lend Yan her strength, defending her borders dozens of times?

Taihe:
Over such a long stretch of time, it certainly defies common sense.

Taihe:
But the situation at hand seems to be going against your wishes, Mr. Liang.

Liang Xun:
If she is a shadow, then the goblet from Lungmen must be a flicker of light.

Liang Xun:
Did the light come first, or did the shadow? A difficult, yet meaningless question.

Taihe:
What is truly difficult are the people who try to answer this question.

Liang Xun:
The Sui Regulator came to me directly, to reason with me in person. Naturally, I understand the gravity of the circumstances.

Taihe:
You promised General Zuo that when the cup arrived in Shangshu, you would feign its theft, allowing it to make its way to his son, Lord Zuo.

Liang Xun:
All to fool certain individuals.

Taihe:
Correct.

Liang Xun:
Though I couldn't possibly have explained this all to Old Lee, an outsider.

Taihe:
Then you should not have chosen a Lungmenite to handle this.

Liang Xun:
Given my status, I can't act rashly. It would do more harm than good if it blemishes the early spring festivities.

Liang Xun:
And as the magistrate, all matters, both large and small, are of the utmost importance to me.

Taihe:
Is he not a friend of yours?

Liang Xun:
He is my friend, but he is also an outsider.

Taihe:
We can hardly blame you, there are too many eyes.

Taihe:
What of the cup?

Liang Xun:
......

Liang Xun:
As I entrusted my friend with the matter, naturally it is with him.

Taihe:
You wish to have the Lungmenite uncover Ling's whereabouts without lifting a finger yourself?

Liang Xun:
Correct.

Taihe:
Oh...

Taihe:
Rumor has it that the cup can possess the things around it. Is it true?

Liang Xun:
Mr. Taihe... I have a question myself.

Taihe:
Please, go ahead.

Liang Xun:
Let us cast aside our status and speak as equals.

Liang Xun:
The Sui Regulator bypassed the Ministry of Rites for this matter, far overstepping its bounds. Once the Ministry learns of this, there will likely be quite the quarrel between the two parties.

Liang Xun:
You are the Deputy Monitor Censor of the Department of Discipline and Supervision. What are your thoughts?

Taihe:
I am indebted to the general, and I am merely repaying the favor.

Liang Xun:
It comes down to personal feelings, then?

Taihe:
That is correct.

Liang Xun:
The Department of Discipline and Supervision's Monitor Censor oversees hundreds of officers and champions integrity. It seems to me there should be no place for personal feelings.

Taihe:
......

Liang Xun:
If the Department of Discipline and Supervision learns of this and finds the Ministry of Rites in the right and the Sui Regulator in the wrong, what will become of those personal feelings?

Taihe:
Garner loyalty and forsake righteousness.

Liang Xun:
There wasn't even the slightest hesitation in your answer, Mr. Taihe.

Taihe:
Naturally.

Taihe:
It was the general himself who taught me those words.

Liang Xun:
Truly a fine man, then.

Taihe:
You needn't worry, however.

Taihe:
General Zuo is a Yanese soldier. He would never do anything illegal.

Liang Xun:
Did something force the Sui Regulator's hand, then? Even if it means bypassing the Ministry of Rites?

Liang Xun:
Right... Lord Exorcist Zuo Xuanliao is a man who normally gives the affairs in the borderlands his utmost attention. Who could have diverted his attention to a mere goblet?

Taihe:
It's no trivial matter, but hardly a significant one either.

Taihe:
And I am certain you already know who it is.

Liang Xun:
*sharp exhale*

Taihe:
Please take care, Mr. Liang.

Liang Xun:
It seems this spring will be colder than expected.

Boatman:
Here we are.

Boatman:
Aside from a few houses here and there, this is the only town near Quijiang Peak.

Lee:
What kind of place is this?

Boatman:
Before Shangshu City was built, it was near the border. The mountain was full of mineral resources, and many blacksmiths and stonemasons worked here.

Lee:
What about now?

Boatman:
With the world at peace, the nomadic cities are all parked around the mountain range. Aside from the few forges kept around as tourist spots, the town is mostly bed-and-breakfasts now.

Lee:
What lies at the top of Qujiang Peak, then...?

Boatman:
No idea.

Lee:
Hm... Perhaps just a place for wine and chess?

Lee:
After all, if it were scenic, there'd be no need to go look for them. Most likely it's a remote place no one ever visits.

Boatman:
I know Shangshu's mounts and waters like the back of my hand... Never heard of any pavilions off the beaten path though.

Boatman:
Qujiang Peak has only an empty swath of land. The legend goes that a god, staring into the deep waters there, attained enlightenment by forgetting the waters surrounding it. From then on, everyone called it the 'Field of Forgotten Water.'

Lee:
I see...

Lee:
Sounds like our friend won't be easy to find, then... How about we start with the wine shops? Might be futile without knowing what they look like though.

Lee:
Any ideas, Master Shen?

Boatman:
When seeking a man, there is this one simple trick that has worked since ancient times.

Boatman:
Have them seek you out instead.

Lee:
True, but a little passive for my tastes.

Lee:
I have an idea, though—

Lee:
Hm...

Pole-Carrier:
What is it?

Pole-Carrier:
Need something?

Liang Xun:
Miss Ning...

Miss Ning:
Reading for leisure, I see. Fine tastes as always, my lord.

Liang Xun:
Reading for leisure enriches the mind.

Miss Ning:
......

Liang Xun:
If there is something you would like to ask, please go ahead.

Miss Ning:
My lord, is something weighing on your mind?

Liang Xun:
Hm... What do you mean?

Miss Ning:
Your friend from Lungmen.

Liang Xun:
There's no hiding anything from you, Miss Ning. There is a minor matter, though it's entirely personal.

Miss Ning:
What does it concern?

Liang Xun:
We are looking for someone.

Miss Ning:
Hm... What kind of someone?

Liang Xun:
An old friend of ours. A practitioner of the martial arts.

Miss Ning:
I see. Is that all?

Liang Xun:
His name is Huai.

Miss Ning:
It seems a simple thing.

Liang Xun:
I did say it was a minor matter... You needn't worry.

Miss Ning:
You should hide no secrets from me, my lord.

Liang Xun:
And I have none to hide.

Miss Ning:
Very well, then.

Liang Xun:
......

The lady before him walks across the room and takes a glance at the bookshelf. She appears engulfed in a sense of defeat.

Fortunately, her mood quickly lightens.

It often changes rapidly.

Miss Ning:
My lord, the book you were reading... Is it a historical record?

Liang Xun:
It's about an old Catastrophe that happened within the bounds of Shangshu's Three Mounts.

Miss Ning:
You seem to be very fond of that piece of history.

Liang Xun:
I saw it with my own eyes. I can never forget it.

Miss Ning:
If I remember correctly... 'Tale of the Three Mounts?'

Liang Xun:
I'm surprised you remember. It seems I've reread that book far too many times.

Miss Ning:
I only happened to notice.

Miss Ning:
May I borrow it? I will be paying Uncle Bai a visit. I can read it in my down time.

Liang Xun:
As you wish.

Miss Ning:
Very well... But...

Liang Xun:
Oh, forgive me...

Liang Xun:
Let me get it for you. I haven't been able to read it much lately, so I placed it fairly high on the shelf.

Miss Ning:
Thank you.

Liang Xun:
So you'll be visiting Bai, the potter?

Miss Ning:
Yes.

Liang Xun:
Please give him my regards.

Miss Ning:
Of course.

Miss Ning:
I will take my leave now.

Miss Ning:
'Tale of the Three Mounts...'

Miss Ning:
My lord, I am sure you never realized, but I have actually already taken a peek at your bookshelf, once when you worked late into the night and fell asleep in your study.

Miss Ning:
(He's never put this book so high up...)

Miss Ning:
(There was a new case on the shelf too... What could be inside?)
