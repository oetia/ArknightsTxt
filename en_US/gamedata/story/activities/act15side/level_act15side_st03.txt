Ling:
What of Rhodes Island's plans after this?

Kroos:
Uh... er... huh? Did I ever introduce myself?

Ling:
What of your plans, even?

Lee:
I've been planning to get this all behind me, go back and ask that aloof Mr. Liang... to pay my bills well.

Ling:
Mm.

Ling:
Perhaps he was right. You and we are not solely together brought for this.

Ling:
Only...

Kroos:
Leizi, how'd you...

Leizi:
I happened to learn from fellow disciples about the Mount Hui-ch'i business, and immediately rushed for Shangshu.

Leizi:
I might've been a little late, but not too late after all.

Kroos:
That's good, then.

Lee:
Miss Ling.

Ling:
Hm?

Lee:
I have a question.

Lee:
How do beings like you determine... er, who's older and younger?

Ling:
Ah, establishing the pecking order.

Ling:
Within a sea of chaos, whoever first finds that answer, first exists upon the human realm.

Lee:
What answer's that?

Ling:
One to a question incredibly simple...

Ling:
...'Who am I.'

Miss Ning:
Mr. Taihe, Mr. Zuo Le. It's good to meet you.

Zuo Le:
Miss Ning. Good to meet you.

Taihe:
Assistant Minister Ning, my pleasure.

Liang Xun:
......

Miss Ning:
'Tis unbecoming of my etiquette that I could not offer you hospitality for your time in Shangshu.

Zuo Le:
We came uninvited and troubled you greatly. We should be first to apologize.

Miss Ning:
You came on your father's orders, handling the goblet and Mount Hui-ch'i incidents in the Sui Regulator's name. 'Twas swift, fierce action.

Zuo Le:
Your insight is as a beacon, Miss Ning.

Zuo Le:
But Mr. Liang's actions, breaking past settled positions, were all the more admirable.

Miss Ning:
Were it not for the Sui Regulator's radicality, he may not have needed such drastic action.

Liang Xun:
My conscience is clear. I imagine the Department of Discipline and Supervision will pursue their own amends once they learn of this.

Taihe:
I've drawn up my report to the Emperor. It's open and fair. No bias allowed for.

Liang Xun:
As you say, Mr. Taihe, 'garner loyalty and forsake righteousness.'

Taihe:
Indeed.

Miss Ning:
But the Sui Regulator has overstepped its ambit. No matter the Grand Tutor's determining, I will report the reality to the High Minister.

Zuo Le:
As one should.

???:
No need.

Grand Tutor:
Zuo Le.

Zuo Le:
Here... here!

Grand Tutor:
By your inference and in those circumstances, how long would you need to suppress the situation, should the three's Sui-Xiang roam the human realm to harm Shangshu?

Grand Tutor:
And should the bestial Sui have awakened, and Yan readied a city to fight it, what would the price be?

Zuo Le:
The former would require three days' effort. The latter would be mutual loss, with the feranmut dead, and three-tenths of the army gone.

Grand Tutor:
Liang Xun.

Liang Xun:
Here.

Grand Tutor:
If I sentenced you to death today, to protect the Ministry of Rites and Sui Regulator, what would you do?

Liang Xun:
Submit to the law, as I ought.

Grand Tutor:
Then if by unexpected turns, your actions today led Shangshu City to be damaged and the common people harmed, what would you do?

Liang Xun:
Should I have sought a way for survival, then better late than never.

Grand Tutor:
The game until now was of equal occupation.

Grand Tutor:
The Lungmenite you chose was an unusual, irrational move, yet he seized some hint from it. A suboptimal piece.

Grand Tutor:
Given so, how much more is within his reckoning? And how much that he hasn't accounted for will return to benefit him?

Miss Ning:
You perceive this matter finely, Grand Tutor.

Grand Tutor:
Liang Xun. The one to take your place as magistrate will arrive at Shangshu within a month. Prepare the transition, and leave with me.

Miss Ning:
......!

Liang Xun:
I... do not know what you mean, Grand Tutor.

Grand Tutor:
Follow me to the capital.

Miss Ning:
......

Liang Xun:
My thanks, Grand Tutor.

Liang Xun:
But I still...

Miss Ning:
—I, Ning Ciqiu, congratulate Mr. Liang on his promotion.

Liang Xun:
I...

Grand Tutor:
Assistant Minister Ning.

Grand Tutor:
Yumen's route back to Yan is set. It docked with Lungmen yesterday, to ready and resupply.

Zuo Le:
—!

Miss Ning:
Was... Yumen City avoiding Catastrophe? Or...

Grand Tutor:
It had other purpose.

Grand Tutor:
Leave for Yumen ahead of time. When I and Liang Xun finish business in the capital, we will naturally proceed for it too.

Miss Ning:
Right...! Understood.

Grand Tutor:
Taihe.

Taihe:
All is proceeding smoothly.

Grand Tutor:
Good.

Zuo Le:
Uncle Taihe? So you long since...

Taihe:
'Garner loyalty and forsake righteousness.' Blame me not, young man.

Grand Tutor:
We will withhold investigation into the Sui Regulator's lapse here for now. At present, only determining whither the one hundred and eighty-one black stones are is key.

Zuo Le:
Understood.

Miss Ning:
Grand Tutor, when will you leave Shangshu?

Grand Tutor:
Tomorrow eve.

Miss Ning:
So very pressing. Need we not await the Messenger ranks' escort...

Grand Tutor:
Unnecessary.

Miss Ning:
Tianshi Bai will want to send you off.

Grand Tutor:
Unnecessary still.

Zuo Le:
Shangshu's mountain ways are rugged. I fear it may be dangerous if you are alone...

Grand Tutor:
What, as if wily criminals dare run amok within Shangshu's borders?

Zuo Le:
No. I simply mind your advanced years. Be careful on lone outings, please...

Grand Tutor:
Within Great Yan's domain under heaven, I only fear if the common people go without peace and national trade is not sufficiently prosperous.

Grand Tutor:
What else should I fear?

Grand Tutor:
Is anything else worth my fear at all?

Lee:
That's over with.

Liang Xun:
Past the fire of danger.

Lee:
You certainly didn't feel the heat.

Liang Xun:
But the danger weighed on us all.

Lee:
So it was all your secret orders from the Sui Regulator, having me bring the cup from Lungmen back to Shangshu.

Lee:
But your status stood in the way, and so did a certain someone by your side, so you had to put a thief's cap on me and get the escorts to act their show.

Lee:
—But you never coordinated that act with me, which I think shows you never wanted to put it on in the first place.

Liang Xun:
You know I never liked acting.

Lee:
So was this your own idea?

Liang Xun:
Yes.

Lee:
But the Candleholders were in Shangshu, and they wouldn't give up at the drop of a hat.

Lee:
You never even wanted this to go down in Shangshu, let alone the Sui Regulator usurping you for a while, them and the Ministry of Rites tearing into each other.

Liang Xun:
True.

Lee:
But if you had your way there, you'd be cast on injustice's side.

Lee:
And so there was someone who probably loved nosing, and probably felt very sorry for you, and he sent a bounty hunter to come steal the cup.

Lee:
Since then it's a weight off your hands.

Lee:
You know who that someone is.

Liang Xun:
Maybe I do.

Lee:
But nobody foresaw Shang Zhong would come soaring through the sky, out for a life.

Lee:
Things turned for the worse, and off everyone tumbled to Qujiang Peak and the Field of Forgotten Water. Not very smart work from you, no, not smart at all...

Lee:
But for you, for Liang Xun, maybe it was a little too smart at the same time.

Liang Xun:
Which is why I entrusted you with it.

Liang Xun:
Someone who could both tell what I was thinking, and would never betray his friends.

Lee:
Should I thank you for still considering me a friend?

Lee:
When all's said and done, though, I wasn't out to find who that goblet's owner was.

Liang Xun:
What were you looking for?

Lee:
You.

Lee:
You're still that same old you, filled with ambition as ever, aren't you.

Liang Xun:
Me?

Lee:
You've gotten smarter, Liang Xun.

Lee:
But that's just fine. Carry on, you.

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
......

Liang Xun:
I have a rough idea as to Huai Tianpei's whereabouts.

Lee:
You've had a rough idea for ages. You just didn't want me distracted.

Liang Xun:
Are you upset at me for not telling you?

Lee:
I was more worried I'd need to keep assisting you.

Liang Xun:
There's been a rumor going about the world of Yanese kung fu lately.

Lee:
Ah, the martial world's rumors.

Liang Xun:
When there's kung fu involved, he could hardly be left out of things.

Grand Tutor:
......

Grand Tutor:
Hmm. Shangshu's a fine place.

Ling:
The plum blossoms bloomed late this year, and I wondered why; so your private visit to this city it was. A rare, rare guest.

Grand Tutor:
When did you master this place?

Ling:
If wished you did to look into it deeply, I could be considered half of these mountains' master true.

Grand Tutor:
The point in question isn't in the persons. It's in you, and your collective.

Grand Tutor:
When the day comes, what sides you stand on, what ways you see things, which ways your hearts feel, will all determine what is lost in the battle there and then.

Ling:
Yan is a hard foe to defeat.

Grand Tutor:
You do have the right to speak on behalf of Yan's army.

Grand Tutor:
You and that learned master held the north for a hundred years apiece, it must be recognized. If not for that, the court would hardly remember you so fondly.

Grand Tutor:
The Sui Regulator's deeds may be sensed to encroach, but no matter what, you are fondly cherished.

Ling:
The years and months tower tall, joys parted with so reluctantly.

Ling:
To this day, in my deepest drunken depths, still my ears prick at horns sounding battalions forth.

Grand Tutor:
...Nian.

Nian:
Uh-huh.

Grand Tutor:
The court wants to make a deal with you.

Nian:
Well how about that. I thought I'd be getting my execution date.

Grand Tutor:
The Chamber of Heaven's Designs hasn't ceased once in a whole millennium. Countless troops and tianshi lie buried in action in the north, yet evil rises as virtue does. The slaughter of wicked spirits is endless, and we've not been able to close the book on it.

Grand Tutor:
The finest of soldiers, the grandest of marshals, the wisest of tianshi, all rush to man the frigid north, year upon year upon year.

Grand Tutor:
The court wants you to erect twelve pagodas and five cities outside the Chamber of Heaven's Designs. Three thousand mechanisms, millions of terracottas.

Grand Tutor:
You needn't do it immediately. Nor will you be on your own. Yan has begun sorting it out, drafting blueprints, and assigning every great tianshi to the case.

Grand Tutor:
I hope you will lend a hand. It'll allow someone to make a return from that tower, at least.

Nian:
Who?

Grand Tutor:
One who would never fall, but absolutely must never fall.

Nian:
You're kidding. I heard some of the rumors from Leizi. Her founder was a super-annoying guy... even if she never met him.

Dusk:
Hmph... a special case of a long life warped by dependence on Originium. Such humankind really doesn't agree with me...

Nian:
Isn't this just because he gave you all that hassle?

Dusk:
Tch.

Ling:
Ah... I remember him.

Ling:
Is he still well?

Grand Tutor:
He is.

Grand Tutor:
He's been stationed at the north for over three hundred and seventy years now. If he can return home, the court would be willing to let him rest at ease, allow him a peaceful retirement...

Grand Tutor:
But the man always says he'd hate to be idle.

Nian:
Sounds like some major engineering work. What do I get out of it, then?

Grand Tutor:
The court will help you with what you want to do.

Grand Tutor:
The wild bestial of bloodshot eyes can't be caged forever.

Nian:
Hah. It all sounds like a win-win for you. We Yan people sure love to haggle...

Grand Tutor:
That's all on that. Think about it.

Ling:
I have a matter I'd like to ask of you in turn.

Grand Tutor:
Please, go on.

Ling:
As of now, is he...

Grand Tutor:
His actions surpassed all feranmutologists' predictions. Turning his own flesh into one hundred and eighty-one black stones... scattering them in the human realm... hmm.

Grand Tutor:
He wants to set up a game across the entire land.

Ling:
Why?

Grand Tutor:
In his endgame days, he'll surely appear again. You'd best ask him yourself then.

Ling:
It's a game we must win.

Grand Tutor:
We cannot lose.

Ling:
Did you hear that, you two?

Dusk:
Would he lose to this Grand Tutor, playing on nineteen by nineteen?

Ling:
Of course he wouldn't.

Dusk:
Then how did the Grand Tutor beat him?

Ling:
The Grand Tutor did not play go with him.

Dusk:
Why?

Ling:
Black and white in their millions upon nineteen by nineteen—it has its intrigue, true, but the Grand Tutor speaks that absorbed within a board of pieces, he cannot see man.

Dusk:
Man?

Ling:
Thus the Grand Tutor played a different game with him. With Yan's domain as the board, with the land's every commoner as the pieces.

Dusk:
Who won?

Ling:
The Grand Tutor, at that time. Thus he was willingly bound in captivity by Yan, and with every loss, he would stay prisoner sixty years.

Nian:
Heh. If Yan always had a genius to beat him, he'd never get a foot out of the capital his whole life, huh?

Ling:
Who can profess to know? He's very poor at the chesses, truth be told.

Ling:
Very slow to learn them, too. Centuries ago, in one cycle of sixty years, he lost hundreds upon thousands of games. The following cycle, he lost some less, and after one more, no more than a hundred games, give or take.

Ling:
And so forth, until a point when no one was left who could beat him.

Ling:
Thus on that cycle, he left the capital... and so that incident transpired.

Nian:
That's when our third sis...

Ling:
Mm.

Ling:
We could all sense that this was no pleasant matter.

Nian:
So the Grand Tutor had to kick his ass before he dragged his own tail back to the capital, ready to be punished?

Ling:
Perhaps it was a good, long while since last he lost in one fell swoop.

Ling:
Or it may be... that his sights were not set on Yan alone anymore.

Blacknight:
So you're Ning Ciqiu.

Miss Ning:
And you, the bounty hunter of enough bravery to plunder a Tianshi Bureau procession.

Blacknight:
I-I didn't know they were good guys yet...

Blacknight:
Where's that old man anyway? The Bai guy?

Miss Ning:
I will take you to meet him.

Miss Ning:
I think, in this turn of events, thanks are due for you.

Blacknight:
It's alright.

Blacknight:
But I still don't get the full picture. Wasn't it just a goblet? If you knew where it was, couldn't you go sneak it off yourself and be done with it?

Miss Ning:
He would not want to hand it to me, so I could hardly take it.

Blacknight:
So you got me to help? Why?

Miss Ning:
Why, I wonder.

Miss Ning:
I simply did not want him drawn into so many vexing matters, without the slightest self-awareness.

Zuo Le:
So this bounty hunter really was yours, Assistant Minister Ning.

Blacknight:
Hey!

Miss Ning:
You need not raise your hackles. They are not enemies.

Miss Ning:
Only...

Zuo Le:
It was the Sui Regulator who hastened in its conduct; we won't question her deeply. Er... as long as she entered Yan's borders through legitimate means, of course...

Miss Ning:
Of course.

Miss Ning:
Go and meet with Tianshi Bai, Blacknight. He awaits you at the agreed location.

Blacknight:
Alright. You take care.

Miss Ning:
......

Zuo Le:
You'd seen through both the Sui Regulator and Mr. Liang's schemes.

Miss Ning:
Not too long ago.

Miss Ning:
But you seem to not have seen through Mr. Liang's plans to mediate from within.

Zuo Le:
He may simply have been apprehensive about betraying you, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
......

Zuo Le:
Regardless, the Sui Regulator overstepped their bounds in this. We will later address the matter ourselves with the Ministry of Rites.

Miss Ning:
It is no matter. 'Tis all to plan further for Yan.

Miss Ning:
'Tis cold outside; may you all rest soon. I will go see young Blacknight; 'tis her first time in Yan, and I cannot rest easy.

Zuo Le:
Farewell, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
Be safe.

Zuo Le:
......

Taihe:
Lord Zuo.

Zuo Le:
I can only hope this pair in love... aren't shaken by big things to come.

Taihe:
......

Taihe:
You're young, Lord Zuo. To say such things invites ideas of feigned maturity.

Zuo Le:
As a Candleholder, I've none of my own ties of the sort.

Taihe:
If I may boldly mention, when you previously passed through that village and dealt with bandits, you did have—

Zuo Le:
*cough*, *cough*—I trust that girl was only repaying the favor! How can you muddle this with affairs between the sexes?

Taihe:
......

Zuo Le:
It was a life saved. If the intent was impure, that would only further serve doubts of advantage being taken.

Zuo Le:
You presume wrong, Uncle Taihe.

Taihe:
Hmm.

Taihe:
It is as you say, young man.

Kroos:
Not heading back to Lungmen, Mr. Lee?

Lee:
No. There's still someone I need to find.

Kroos:
Come with?

Kroos:
I'm stopping by the branch office with the funnyman anyhow, and then I've got to get back to the Rhodes Island landship...

Lee:
It seems we'll be tagging along. But I'd rather not be a nuisance to Rhodes Island again.

Kroos:
No need to stand on honor.

Lee:
Trust me, it's personal matters.

Lee:
That codename Nothing operator got drawn into all this mess, had his leg hurt for nothing, and he's still in the hospital now. Don't want to give you all any more grief than that.

Kroos:
That's good, then.

Mulberry:
K-Kroos!

Kroos:
Oh, fancy that! Mulberry!

Kroos:
If you're in Shangshu already, I'm guessing Lava got to the branch office a while ago, then?

Mulberry:
Y-Yeah... and Lava wanted me to tell you too, it's best you head there quickly. It seems like something else happened...

Kroos:
Ahaha... this trip to Yan sure never takes a breather.

Lee:
It happens.

Kroos:
It used to just be around Lungmen and stuff... oh, right.

Kroos:
I've been wanting to ask. You said Mr. Liang and Wei Yenwu are real alike, but alike how?

Lee:
Did I say that?

Kroos:
You did. After we met him, I was even thinking, wait, they're completely different...

Lee:
Mmm...

Lee:
Well, after all... both their sweethearts have them by the ears.

Ling:
......

Voice in the Cup:
You're back.

Ling:
A hundred and eighty-one black stones. You'll beat Sui to losing your sanity.

Voice in the Cup:
While you've already spent all these years in here, in your drunken stupor? No... the years and months mean nothing to you.

Ling:
That farce of the Xingyu Escort Association was a move planned out by you.

Voice in the Cup:
Not totally.

Ling:
They should be clean of responsibility for me... Why swallow them all into this?

Voice in the Cup:
Just as a reminder.

Ling:
A reminder to me?

Voice in the Cup:
Here you dream of all under heaven. Though you know how the universe dwarfs all, the grass in spring still tugs at your heart.

Voice in the Cup:
From Jiangnan, up to Saibei, then back to this summit atop the clouds, you've changed a lot. It disturbs me, little sister, so I warn you.

Voice in the Cup:
Warn you that the feelings of man are not so pure as those moralists would have you believe.

Sat on equally pitted sides, the brother is in strife, love and disgust and passion and resentment all taken as pieces to the game.

You don't fear them now. Of course you don't. But sooner or later, you will. Nian will, Dusk will. They've become too much like people, so they will come to fear those things.

That is all... this little warning is.

Ling:
......

Voice in the Cup:
Are you angered?

Ling:
The cup should only hold wine; wine should not be so wordy.

In that instant, all things halt.

Shangshu's Three Mounts and Seventeen Peaks now have one more peak, and countless more trees, with countless more branches, with countless more leaves.

Wind blows, but the leaves are still.

Shangshu once had a Catastrophe.

The devastating storm loose with sparks, shattered Originium crystals descending like fiery rain.

Voice in the Cup:
—!

Voice in the Cup:
—Shangshu—once had a Catastrophe!

Voice in the Cup:
Someone—offered wine to the heavens, and the black clouds parted, and the people were safe! And yet now, you're going to fling this goblet to the black clouds!

A black goblet. A black piece.

In the face of the most terrifying disaster of all the land, all trace is instantly annihilated.

Voice in the Cup:
Are you feeling wrathful? Compassionate? Envious?

Voice in the Cup:
Carve these emotions into you—things are soon to come—

Ling:
......

Ling:
Things, soon to come... Certainly, I cannot stay uninvolved... isn't that right.

Ling:
Phew... haah.

Ling:
For now, I shall go purchase wine.

Pole-Carrier:
I'll be leaving Shangshu.

Innkeeper Zheng:
I won't stop you.

Innkeeper Zheng:
If two people want to kill each other, the feelings aren't too hard to understand.

Innkeeper Zheng:
But if two people want to be killed by the other...

Pole-Carrier:
Then we should save the effort. We'd just be wallowing.

Innkeeper Zheng:
I'm planning to retire now.

Pole-Carrier:
Du Yaoye still isn't ready for it. And doesn't the girl seem just a little like she wants her own business?

Innkeeper Zheng:
If so, I'll shutter things.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Don't you agree?

Pole-Carrier:
I'm not one of the escorts.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Good.

Pole-Carrier:
Zheng Qingyue. Our business is only postponed for a while. We're not shaking hands and making up here.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Association custom says you don't talk grudges when you're at the bar. I'll be in Shangshu anyhow, waiting for you.

Pole-Carrier:
......

Innkeeper Zheng:
......

Pole-Carrier:
One last thing.

Pole-Carrier:
I hear...

Miss Du:
Dad! Master Shang!

Innkeeper Zheng:
What are you charging in here about...?

Miss Du:
I've decided! Me and the guys all talked it through!

Miss Du:
We're going to Yumen!
