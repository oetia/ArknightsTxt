In one or two more branches' time, the color of dusk will paint the sky.

These are the Three Mounts and Seventeen Peaks, though which mount this is, or which peak, is a mystery.

The only thing known is that a pavilion sits atop, Shangshu's scenery both past and present visible from within, beauty unparalleled.

Yet regrettably, this pavilion is currently deserted, and so no one is there to see it.

And on that note, people have come.

Nian:
Well, here's the place.

Dusk:
......

Nian:
What? That depressed about meeting her?

Dusk:
She gets on my nerves.

Nian:
She's not gonna bug you.

Dusk:
That's why she gets on my nerves.

Nian:
...*Sigh*.

Nian:
She's our big sister either way. Let's straighten up.

Dusk:
She's not even here.

Nian:
Nope, she isn't. Why not?

Nian:
With all the fuss down below... taking cover up here in the ranges does kind of smell like her style.

Dusk:
How come when I hide you call me a recluse, but when she does it you're like this?!

Nian:
Hey... it's not like she's always trying to hide.

Nian:
She's just tipsy and worn out, looking for a nice crag splitting the drifting clouds to lie down on, knocking out for a moment. That's not so bad.

Dusk:
Grr. This is discrimination.

Nian:
Pull the other one.

Dusk:
I just hope she doesn't cause any trouble for us.

Dusk:
She's always half-drunk, half-asleep, half-awake. It's those people who'll come give us trouble.

Nian:
Yeah, real nice how she can sleep through this. Is she even able to?

Nian:
Say, what'cha think she dreams of?

Dusk:
I don't know. Don't ask me.

Dusk:
......

Dusk:
Heaven knows where her mind wanders. She'll come back on her own once she's bored, in any case.

Nian:
I hear this peak's apparently meant to be wrecked.

Nian:
Wonder how hard Kroos and the Nothing guy'll have to work finding this summit at all.

Innkeeper Zheng:
*Sigh*...

Inn Assistant:
Sir, what do you have there?

Innkeeper Zheng:
What comes will come, trouble and all.

Inn Assistant:
You bumped into Shang?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Yes. He stole the cup.

Inn Assistant:
That bastard! How does one man be so single-minded—!

Innkeeper Zheng:
Leave it. This whole thing is a mess.

Inn Assistant:
Heh, good swords always keep the rust away.

Inn Assistant:
Been years since I saw you draw it, sir.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Blades are ruthless things. Best put to use slicing melons and chopping greens.

Innkeeper Zheng:
But if I want my business handed smoothly over to my darling Ye, then I have to settle things with Shang Zhong eventually.

Inn Assistant:
Old Shang might be muddled in the head, but he's not the good-for-nothing who'd harass the Miss about paying her father's debts.

Inn Assistant:
Sir, you still won't step over that final line, will you?

Innkeeper Zheng:
What kind of person could?

Innkeeper Zheng:
One storm, two lives. It was my mistake that let his son die. He has a grudge against me I can't argue with.

Innkeeper Zheng:
I know more than anyone how he's felt all these years.

Inn Assistant:
Sir...

Innkeeper Zheng:
Relax. I'll get the cup back, at the very least.

Innkeeper Zheng:
If I don't, I won't have anything to report.

Kroos:
Master Shen—isn't there any way to get up the mountains a little quicker?

Boatman:
In a sense, but for people who've never taken the mountain passes before, it might be...

Kroos:
You're fine, I'm used to this.

Boatman:
Alright, then. This way.

Waregeist:
Ao—!

Miss Du:
Gah. What's the deal with these things?

Lee:
......

Miss Du:
Hey! Lee!

Miss Du:
I'm fighting for you here! Is this any place to space out?

Lee:
...I'm fine.

Lee:
But...

Miss Du:
Pull it together. I don't know why these things keep mobbing us, and we've lost the Blacknight lady and the pole-carrier by now.

Miss Du:
Why aren't you, I don't know, hurrying it up?

Lee:
No rush, now, no rush.

Lee:
When I accept a friend's request, I see it through. It's just...

Lee:
We need to find a favorable pavilion near very favorable water for it.

Boatman:
Huff...

Boatman:
(At such a young age, her agility is nearly unimaginable...)

Boatman:
Such a steep pass, and you're not even gasping for air yet.

Boatman:
Have you been crossing mountains all your life?

Kroos:
Only got into the habit the last couple of years...

Kroos:
And I'm Rim Billiton-born. Might not be quite the Yan style, but it's a life on the wilder side anyhow.

Boatman:
I see.

Boatman:
The passes around these summits are all hard to traverse. They always said in olden times that Shu's paths tried you. People argue which ones that meant, but it's all of them, in truth.

Kroos:
Master Shen, you think there's a reason Mr. Lee told us to find him at Qujiang Peak?

Boatman:
When he was looking into the goblet's origins for Mr. Liang, the first place he said he'd head for was Qujiang Peak.

Boatman:
And he asked for 'Zuanjiang Peak.' Only a few locals know that old name; the authorities changed it however many years ago. I was baffled how he even knew it.

Kroos:
Maybe Mr. Lee found some kind of lead on it...

Boatman:
He did have a lead. He said, he dreamt of it.

Boatman:
I assumed he was hiding something, using that reason to parry me, so I didn't follow up... If he really did see it in his dreams, then that's all more curious.

Boatman:
Hmm... Qujiang Peak is a high and treacherous one. It gets the least tourists. It's all the more peaceful here, compared to the well-inhabited Nini Peak with its gentle flat paths, or Shuzhou Peak covered with old theater byways.

Boatman:
You've seen... the few small villages, buildings left, are all left over from long, long ago.

Boatman:
Though...

Kroos:
Is there some other hint?

Boatman:
Though... when Qujiang Peak was still called Zuanjiang Peak, atop this region of mountain, there was actually another peak.

Boatman:
It and Zuanjiang together were called the 'Twin Peaks High as the Sun,' the two most majestic prominences of the Three Mounts and Eighteen Peaks.

Boatman:
And this peak had countless cliffs, the steepest parts almost vertical, like a stone sword against the heavens when you looked from afar. It was a magnificent sight.

Boatman:
If you watched from any other peak at sunset, it was as if the sun fell straight on it, as if someone ran it through by their blade.

Boatman:
Sadly, later there was a massive Catastrophe, like fire and storm linking hands, and the terrain around here was scarred well. Most of that swordlike peak collapsed and crumbled. That was thirty years ago, now.

Boatman:
You can pull aside any Shangshuite on the street of at least some age, and they could all tell you clear and cleanly of the marvel of those black clouds weighing on the city.

Boatman:
I regret I wasn't eking my living on this river yet then. I never got to see it with my own eyes.

Kroos:
A Catastrophe... And Shangshuites'd call it a marvel?

Boatman:
It's a strange thing. It came without the slightest warning. By the time the Imperial Astronomers got the warning out telling the villages nearby to evacuate, it was already barely manageable. There should've been no escape from it...

Boatman:
But ultimately, thunder clapped and the storm faded, and apart from a few lightly battered houses, all the residences in the mountains suffered not a single bit of damage, and not one person was afflicted. That was the first wonder.

Boatman:
Afterwards, the Tumu tianshi came to inspect the altered mountain terrain. Normally, with a wondrous peak collapsing like that, there should be visible traces left.

Boatman:
But apart from half of the rocky 'hilt' left next to Qujiang Peak, not a single chunk of boulder or sign of the landslide was found. That was the second wonder.

Boatman:
What caused any of that, nobody knows. There's just some wild rumors, barely worth trusting.

Kroos:
Never thought something like that happened in Shangshu before...

Boatman:
Yan's history and its legends have always blended together.

Boatman:
Like how some rumors say Shangshu's birth was to do with the lands in ancient people's dreams. The factual matter of things is beyond anyone's research powers, now.

Kroos:
The peak that disappeared—what was its name?

Boatman:
The sunseeker. Xunri Peak.

Boatman:
But Yan's development has flown by. I fear to the younger generation, things that happened thirty years ago wouldn't be worth the time, being so far in the past.

Uphill Voice:
Stay still—!

Kroos:
—Who's that?

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) Stone the flamin' fowlbeasts!- Light, keep it from buggering off!

Waregeist:
Wrrrr—! Aoww—!

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) You just—settle down, love—!

Waregeist:
—Wwrr!

Boatman:
Is she... trying to catch that thing?

Kroos:
Seems like it...

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) Crikey, just like that, keep it bound tight, eyes glued to it!

Kroos:
(Rim Billitonian) You a Rim Billy, then?

Blacknight:
......!

Blacknight:
......

Kroos:
(Rim Billitonian) Now, quit muckin' about... we're only...

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) Ya wouldn't be Yanese just lookin' at ya.

Waregeist:
Aoww—!

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) —Oi help us out. Hrgh! Hey take a squiz at this and lemme know what kinda animal this is?

Kroos:
(Rim Billitonian) It's... some Originium Arts creation-type.

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) Originium Arts? Like those stunts the Leithanian lord boys pull? You revvin my cylinder? Had me thinkin' it was some Yan critter I could tame...

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) Which galah went and made these things up...?! Light! Just let it go, it's as useful as an ashtray on a bike!

Kroos:
......

Kroos:
(Rim Billitonian) We're looking for their owner, too. Whadyareckon?

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) I...

Kroos:
(Rim Billitonian) You a Messenger's guard? Bounty hunter?

Kroos:
(Rim Billitonian) No sense in shootin' a hound if it's gone into the neighbors paddock, wanna work together on this?

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) I don't know you from Bruce, mate, so don't think I'm gonna trust ya

Kroos:
(Rim Billitonian) A Billy, though.

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) Not every one of them's so nice.

Kroos:
(Rim Billitonian) That's a dead shame, then...

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) But getting to meet a Billitonian out here's still got me gobsmacked

Blacknight:
(Rim Billitonian) Hooroo. See you round like a boomerang, Cautus.

Kroos:
......

Boatman:
Your countryman?

Kroos:
Suppose so... can't shake this dodgy feeling...

Kroos:
Ah, whatever. How far left to the summit, Master Shen?

Pole-Carrier:
A road this wide, and you two can't move aside?

Taihe:
Tough.

Pole-Carrier:
What does a mandarin want with me?

Zuo Le:
Master Shang. Do you have any idea what that thing on your belt is?

Pole-Carrier:
Is it yours?

Zuo Le:
Yes and no, but we hope you'll hand it to us.

Pole-Carrier:
How do you know me?

Zuo Le:
We've heard some rumors.

Pole-Carrier:
Hoh. What did Zheng Qingyue tell you?

Zuo Le:
If your first reaction is to think of Sir Zheng, then presumably you know where we came from?

Pole-Carrier:
The Sui Regulator's Candleholders.

Pole-Carrier:
But you're so young... You're one I've never met before.

Taihe:
If you're aware of our rank, why don't you give up the cup?

Pole-Carrier:
Me and Zheng Qingyue need to settle things.

Zuo Le:
But it seems like those things and the item at your waist are unrelated.

Pole-Carrier:
My son died for this goblet. How could I be unrelated?

Waregeist:
Wrwwrr...

Pole-Carrier:
Fine ability, for one so young. These animals almost seem to fear you.

Taihe:
We ask only your cooperation.

Pole-Carrier:
What if I say no? Will you rob me in the open?

Zuo Le:
I imagine you'll find absolutely no purpose in this cup.

Zuo Le:
But to we of the Sui Regulator, the cup has tremendous use.

Pole-Carrier:
What use?

Zuo Le:
Bait.

Pole-Carrier:
For what?

Zuo Le:
Those who bring ruin to the nation and its people.

Pole-Carrier:
Yan has known peace for centuries. Where did criminals like those come from?

Zuo Le:
That's need-to-know.

Zuo Le:
However, we ask you to believe us. Entrust the goblet to us, and you'll have done a justice great as the heavens.

Pole-Carrier:
Hah! A justice... For someone of my sort, it'd mean too little, and be more than I deserve.

Pole-Carrier:
Move aside.

Zuo Le:
I fear that's not for you to decide, Master Shang.

Pole-Carrier:
This goblet is to be buried with my son. Zheng Qingyue must come in person...

Pole-Carrier:
Otherwise, keep shut!

Pole-Carrier:
I'll wait for him, at the Field of Forgotten Water on Qujiang Peak!

Taihe:
Ingrate!

Taihe:
—A staff fighter?

Pole-Carrier:
Oh—good, strong might. You have some force, old bull.

Taihe:
Lord Zuo, this man hides his talents. No good lies in him.

Zuo Le:
Get the goods before anything! Don't let him keep you!

Pole-Carrier:
Did you ever hear from Zheng Qingyue the words I hate most?

Taihe:
Don't fool with us!

Pole-Carrier:
—They're 'save the goods, then the men.'
