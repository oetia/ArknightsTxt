Lee:
Where's it gone...?

Waregeist:
Ao-ao!

Lee:
Oh.

Lee:
It's on that branch over there... and there's a great seething mass of oddities beneath it...

Waregeist:
Ao...

Lee:
Haha. How do I fetch this now, then...?

A counter of black.

All things have their needs. These waregeists' dispositions correspond with the 'desires' of the wares.

So, the ones who roused me...

Is it my young sister who hunches over scrolls splashing ink into scapes, or that young sister in words of gold, who makes it so when she speaks?

Or...

Was it only him as he threw a piece down, with a momentary clack?

Lee?:
Out of the way.

Waregeist:
—!

Waregeist:
Wrr—wrwwrr!

Lee?:
......

Nian:
Long time no see.

Lee:
Hm? You're a... Rhodes Islander...

Nian:
Aww. So it was just old Lee.

Nian:
Still, long time no see. What dragged you from Lungmen to Shangshu?

Street Youth:
Hey, what do you mean he took his sword and left? He went to fight someone?

Inn Assistant:
Who knows.

Street Youth:
None of us new ones've ever seen him use it before. Yeah, come to think of it, he's been getting his business big. Got himself stable in Shangshu just with his restaurants.

Street Youth:
What's his style with his sword?

Inn Assistant:
He really hasn't used it all that much these days. To be honest, he just cuts melons, dices leaves, chops meat and handles fins.

Inn Assistant:
His fighting days are long behind. It's been a long time since he ever went to, well, 'harm' anyone with a blade.

Street Youth:
He's sorta retired from all the business, then, that type? So what's he gonna do with it out there now?

Inn Assistant:
Dice, I guess. He's been dicing for so long, it's the only thing he knows how to do now.

Street Youth:
That's lame.

Inn Assistant:
Well, duh. What, is dicing vegetables for ages going to power you up?

Pole-Carrier:
Good technique! Seems you didn't just stay an innkeeper all these years!

Innkeeper Zheng:
No, I really haven't used it since then.

Innkeeper Zheng:
I'm used to counting my chips, sorting out my needs... I never thought I'd still be so able with this frostblade of mine.

Innkeeper Zheng:
It's surprising.

Pole-Carrier:
What would winning or losing even mean, if I met a Zheng Qingyue depressed and joyless? It hung on my mind.

Pole-Carrier:
It seems heaven must have willed this.

Miss Du:
—Heaven who? You're just obsessed with getting revenge!

Pole-Carrier:
Urgh...!

Innkeeper Zheng:
Ye! Don't interfere! Go after that Lungmenite, and find the goblet!

Miss Du:
Sorry, dad, but you're not in charge here now—

Miss Du:
Ugh!

Pole-Carrier:
I predicted this from you.

Innkeeper Zheng:
I never once laid a hand on her.

Innkeeper Zheng:
You'll regret this.

Zuo Le:
Uncle Taihe, You help the innkeeper out.

Taihe:
You, young man?

Zuo Le:
I'll search for the cup. It can't wait any longer.

Mr. Nothing:
Hold it!

Taihe:
Stop there!

Mr. Nothing:
Er, let's not be too hasty with the rocks now. Pull any more away and we'll be stranded up here, wouldn't you say?

Taihe:
The struggling of the cornered.

Mr. Nothing:
Benefactor! I'll hold out here! You go help Brother Lee! Don't let that kid get away with it!

Kroos:
Right! You watch yourself!

Mr. Nothing:
Now, you really must stop with the bullying here. The only reason I've not kicked into action is because you're a mandarin, after all—

Taihe:
Is that why?

Taihe:
I repay Lord Zuo's patronage. I go with him. My status has nothing to do with this.

Taihe:
Come! Disciple of Lien, you and I contest purely as martial men. We shall test each other.

Mr. Nothing:
Then, don't mind if I do!

Zuo Le:
...Oh.

Zuo Le:
Rain?

Townsfolk:
Is it raining?

Townsfolk:
Shoot, the forecast promised it'd be sunny today.

Teahouse Assistant:
Sir, it's raining. Would you like to come inside and take a seat?

Liang Xun:
No, thank you.

Teahouse Assistant:
Are you rainviewing? That's a good hobby, sir. I'll bring an umbrella in just a moment...

Teahouse Assistant:
Where's the boatman who was with you?

Liang Xun:
He went to the mountains.

Teahouse Assistant:
Right now? He might be stuck up there once it's dark.

Liang Xun:
Yes, right now.

Liang Xun:
It was a favor for me.

Zuo Le:
Ah! It's that Lungmenite!

Zuo Le:
Are the Waregeists surrounding him...? Hold on, who's that next to him?

Nian:
Oh. Looks like we've got new guests.

Zuo Le:
Nian...!

Nian:
Here to squabble over the cup too?

Lee:
Phew. That's a few less people than I was expecting.

Zuo Le:
I am Zuo Le, Candleholder of the Sui Regulator of Great Yan. By Master Tai's instruction, I am confidentially investigating Dusk and the black goblet's whereabouts.

Waregeist:
Ao... ao...

Lee:
These little things seem quite scared of you.

Nian:
If they're scared of me, hey, I get it. But this li'l boy here...

Nian:
What's that you've got on you?

Zuo Le:
You're swift.

Nian:
Uh-huh... I see... Just like that old-ass guy said.

Nian:
So how'd you get tangled up in this party, Mr. Lee?

Lee:
I think that's a bit of a long story, Miss Nian...

Lee:
But I'm very sorry I pulled a handful of Rhodes Island's operators in as well.

Nian:
No big. If Kroos and li'l Lava couldn't handle this stuff, they'd never get to see things wrap up.

Lee:
Well, well. You really haven't changed, Miss Nian...

Nian:
Lemme tell you, we've been through a whole drama these last two days. That scary old guy did tell us a few things, though.

Nian:
Including how the Sui Regulator and Ministry of Rites aren't quite getting along. Hey, kid, are your bunch really in such a hurry... to get rid of us?

Zuo Le:
......

Nian:
There's gotta be some reason, other than me pulling Dusk out of her hidey-hole without a permission slip.

Nian:
C'mon, hit me with it. If it makes sense, I might just change my mind and help you out, y'know?

Zuo Le:
It's none of your concern.

Zuo Le:
But if you're showing of your own accord, then all the better...

Zuo Le:
Where is she?

Nian:
Who?

Zuo Le:
Stop playing the fool!

Nian:
Sheesh. You climbed the wrong mountain, then.

Zuo Le:
What?

Nian:
She's at the summit. The top of the tallest peak in this whole sea of clouds.

Nian:
Did you try checking up there yet?

Zuo Le:
There's nothing in the Field of Forgotten Water. It's no different than an ordinary mountain.

Nian:
That so?

Zuo Le:
—! Don't touch that cup—!

Oh... if it isn't Nian?

Long time no see.

Zuo Le:
—

Kroos:
W-What?

Nian:
This, right here, right now, THIS is the highest point in all of the Shangshu Mountains.

Kroos:
'Highest point' isn't really a 'right here, right now' sort of definition, ya know.

Nian:
I say: A summit is only consummate by a beautiful view.

Nian:
What does the highest point really mean in a physical sense, anyway? If I set down a chair here, that's one step higher, right?

Lee:
This place... I think I must've...

Nian:
Seen it in a dream?

Lee:
You know something after all, Miss Nian.

Nian:
Of course. You and this thing've been together for way too long.

Nian:
Sure, ordinary humans might not figure the goblet's secret, but you and the Sui Regulator have been way off the ball, seriously...

Nian:
Or maybe, that was part of your plan too...?

Kroos:
Nian?

Nian:
Nah. Let's not get into me for now... That kid there looks like he's bursting to say something, huh?

Zuo Le:
Firstly, I need you to give an explanation for Dusk's departure.

Zuo Le:
Ms. Kroos persists in regarding you as a Rhodes Islander. Thus, all three of you here have some relation to the company.

Zuo Le:
In accordance with your answers and this incident's resolution... I will consider penning a letter to the imperial court, with grave regard to this matter.

Kroos:
Urgh...!

Nian:
Dragging Dusk off was my call entirely. Rhodes Island just accepted a personal request of mine. That satisfy you?

Zuo Le:
No. Any time the twelve of you meet, exchange messages or converse is a major strain on the Sui Regulator's nerves. How can you be ignorant of that?

Nian:
Oh, that's some mature words for such a young kid...

Nian:
Who's the boss of the Sui Regulator now? Anyone I know?

Zuo Le:
You've been idle for too long. The human realm has gone through changes.

Nian:
Dang.

Zuo Le:
Where's Dusk? And where's Ling?

Zuo Le:
And what intent do you three have, assembling in Shangshu? And what secrets... does this goblet hide?

Nian:
You guys asked someone to get the cup from Lungmen, duh. How's that our fault?

Zuo Le:
You know the significance of us necessitating it be in the Sui Regulator's hands—

Nian:
—Of course. This thing's got a chunk of my good ol' second bro's conscious jailed in it.

Zuo Le:
You're well-aware. Then it's exceedingly hard to consider any of you here unaware or innocent.

Lee:
I wasn't going to pretend to be unaware... even though Liang Xun really didn't tell me a thing.

Kroos:
Hahah. Might've been stretching it a little when I kept saying Rhodes Island didn't know anything?

Nian:
Yeah, I'd say, seeing how you're a casualty.

Lee:
Me?

Nian:
I only just realized it. And you Sui Regulator guys, c'mon, you spent all these years with nothing to do but think about it and you still couldn't get there?

Zuo Le:
The Feranmut is not only able to separate parts of itself into proxies with independent personalities, but can store its consciousness within certain mediums in order to roam...

Zuo Le:
But can your proxies really do the same thing over again? Just as if you were an Ursus matryoshka.

Nian:
I don't know if we can or not... Maybe it's a new trick he came up with.

Nian:
So he can collect all hundred and eighty-one black stones or something like that.

Zuo Le:
Wouldn't he go mad?

Nian:
I mean, he's already gone mad, though. With him locked up in the capital, it's not like you can't pay him a visit.

Zuo Le:
Meeting with him would be the greatest taboo.

Nian:
You Sui Regulator people have done so much, and you still care?

Zuo Le:
What about Dusk? What did you seek Dusk for? And why did you come here after doing so?

Nian:
...I have an idea.

Zuo Le:
According to the records, you're always full of ideas.

Nian:
Hm... I guess you actually know a little about me, huh?

Kroos:
(She's looking this way...)

Lee:
......

Nian:
I want...

Nian:
...to come up with a way to wipe out that giant thing.

Rain.

A drizzle of spring rain.

A boatman who sails the waterways, at this moment, travels through the towering mountains.

Boatman:
It's almost dark.

Boatman:
*Sigh*... Climbing up and down like this really wracks my old body...
