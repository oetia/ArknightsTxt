Lee:
Well, that was an unfruitful day...

Lee:
I never had such headaches back at the agency in Lungmen.

Boatman:
Because Mr. Liang left you no leads to follow?

Lee:
No, it's actually because... I have a lot of friends in Lungmen.

Lee:
And aside from Mr. Liang the shut-in, the only friend I have in Shangshu is you, Master Shen.

Boatman:
*Sigh*...

Boatman:
There's a crowd at his door, isn't there?

Lee:
Doesn't look like they're trying to be discreet.

Suspicious Passerby:
Hey, the Lungmenite's here too. Right... Don't be rash. Just don't let them get away.

Suspicious Passerby:
Keep an eye on them.

Lee:
Eh, I don't suppose we walked into their trap?

Boatman:
Weird... It doesn't matter how glorious they were in the old days, they're just a bunch of restaurateurs now. Do they really have this much influence?

Odd Traveler:
There's no one else around—W-Wait!

Suspicious Passersby:
M-Master Shang.

Pole-Carrier:
......

Pole-Carrier:
I'm here.

Boatman:
......

Lee:
H-Have a seat. Would you like some tea?

Pole-Carrier:
I asked around.

Pole-Carrier:
There are a few spots that fit the description. Very few visitors, but there are some pavilions that have been around for a while. I marked them on the map.

Pole-Carrier:
As for your wine shops, wherever there's a settlement, it's practically guaranteed that there's one. These places fit the bill.

Lee:
Hmm...

Boatman:
There's one at Qujiang Peak?

Pole-Carrier:
I have no idea myself, but Old Qian insisted that there is.

Pole-Carrier:
These are all out-of-the-way trails. No normal sightseers would go there. Be careful.

Lee:
I see. Thank you, Master Shang.

Pole-Carrier:
I will take my leave, then...

Lee:
Master Shang, do you know those men outside the door...?

Suspicious Passersby:
—!

Pole-Carrier:
Don't know them.

Pole-Carrier:
Goodbye.

Suspicious Passerby:
What's going on...?

Suspicious Passerby:
(Tell the innkeeper... Master Shang and the Lungmenite have dealings with each other!)

Odd Traveler:
(Should we still block the way out here?)

Suspicious Passerby:
(What the hell are you even trying to block? Let's go! We're out of here!)

Liang Xun:
You're back.

Lee:
That trip was a complete waste. Please don't ask.

Liang Xun:
I'm just worried about bandits coming after you.

Lee:
As long as you're looking out for me, they won't make trouble.

Lee:
What's more, our hot little goblet isn't in my possession anymore. You should be careful yourself.

Liang Xun:
No need.

Liang Xun:
We found out who ambushed you. It's all a misunderstanding. They thought you were a smuggler pillaging artifacts.

Lee:
Well, it sounds like Shangshu's chivalric code is alive and well. That was quite the brawl for a minor 'misunderstanding.'

Liang Xun:
Don't blame them.

Liang Xun:
Master Shen, Lee isn't a local. I'm afraid I'll need you to take care of him for the next couple of days.

Boatman:
Of course, it's not big deal.

Liang Xun:
I know things are hectic at the docks lately. I'll pay you double your wage for your time.

Boatman:
Don't worry about it, Mr. Liang. We never talk money.

Liang Xun:
I can't do wrong by my citizens.

Liang Xun:
You've been a great help, and I might need more of your help in the future.

Boatman:
Fine, then... If that's how you feel, then I won't push it.

Boatman:
I'll stick with our boy Lee for as long as he's here. Those of us who make a living on the mountain trails and rivers know the Three Mounts and Seventeen Peaks like the backs of our hands.

Liang Xun:
Thank you.

Lee:
—Liang Xun.

Liang Xun:
What's the matter?

Lee:
We'll talk inside.

Lee:
I remember telling you that as long as you aren't hiding anything from me, this will be nothing complicated.

Lee:
Tell me, what exactly is the story behind the cup and its master?

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
You can't tell me?

Liang Xun:
No.

Lee:
I ran into those guys again in the mountains today.

Liang Xun:
What...?

Lee:
So that little 'misunderstanding' of yours isn't actually very convincing.

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
How high are the stakes?

Liang Xun:
As high as heaven.

Lee:
*Sigh*...

Lee:
You should've told me sooner.

Liang Xun:
I was afraid you'd get dragged into the mess if you knew too much.

Lee:
So you still think I'm not part of the mess?

Liang Xun:
Forgive me.

Liang Xun:
You should get some rest. If our friend proves too difficult to locate... then you don't have to worry about it.

Lee:
We've come this far. You can't suddenly have second thoughts about this, can you?

Lee:
I appreciate the feeling, but if I really call it quits here, that's the end of the good life for you. I know that much.

Lee:
So what's on the table? You can at least tell me that, can't you?

Liang Xun:
Both the people and the country.

Lee:
Well, the stakes do sound high, and it's such a tall tale, I'm finding that kind of hard to believe.

Liang Xun:
I would never joke about such a serious matter.

Lee:
Of course I know you wouldn't.

Lee:
Let me change the subject, then. You wouldn't be entertaining a lovely lady this evening, would you?

Liang Xun:
—*Cough*.

Liang Xun:
There is nothing between me and Miss Ning.

Lee:
I never said there's anything between you two.

Liang Xun:
Your eyes said enough.

Lee:
Really? Everyone always ridicules you for how unsociable you are, but even Huai Tianpei's girl is all grown up now. You have to have scored a home run at least once or twice?

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
You have your reasons, huh?

Liang Xun:
......

Liang Xun:
How about a drink?

Liang Xun:
It's high time we had a drink together.

Lee:
Right... We're long overdue.

Zuo Le:
You truly are a swift one, Miss Kroos. The innkeeper wasn't kidding.

Zuo Le:
Where is the man with the fan?

Kroos:
We couldn't risk a complete wipeout in case you had any traps set up here, can we?

Zuo Le:
How peculiar... I thought you would send him, while you hide in the shadows.

Zuo Le:
As the saying goes, one should sacrifice a pawn to save one's queen. Not only are you the 'queen,' you're a crossbowman and an escape artist.

Zuo Le:
Even so, you came personally.

Kroos:
Well, my mate Nothing isn't a regular operator yet. I can't just have him fly into the face of danger.

Zuo Le:
And yet you still have a mind for danger, especially when you have to go it alone, don't you?

Kroos:
If you're the kind of bloke who goes all 'I can see right through you' just to seem smart, I'd rather go home and have a sleep.

Zuo Le:
Haha... so temperamental. Forget I said anything, then.

Zuo Le:
I'll get to the point. We've looked into Rhodes Island a little. With so little time, we didn't dig up a lot of information.

Zuo Le:
I don't claim to fully know you, but at least know you can be trusted.

Kroos:
Can I? Not only did I butt my head into this affair, I'm an Infected, you know?

Zuo Le:
You must put the right people to the right job. Oripathy is a misfortune that all Infected face. What does that have to do with their responsibilities or skills?

Kroos:
......

Zuo Le:
I would like Rhodes Island to do us a favor.

Zuo Le:
No, in fact, if you don't help us, then I'm afraid you'd be making an enemy of us.

Kroos:
You want Mr. Lee's goblet.

Kroos:
When I chased the thief that night, right away, the tracks split into two. It was dark out, and you moved quick, but I never took my eyes off the one who'd actually left the Liang estate.

Kroos:
I lost them not long thereafter, though. And then a certain someone showed up, just like it was a planned diversion—

Kroos:
The innkeeper drew my attention. Was he drawing it away from you?

Zuo Le:
No wonder he thinks so highly of you.

Kroos:
Bingo, eh?

Kroos:
What does the cup have to do with ‘Sui?'

Zuo Le:
You know of 'Sui?'

Zuo Le:
Oh... Looks like you're not lying, though you know only half the story.

Kroos:
Hm, is that so?

Zuo Le:
Considering you see Nian and Dusk as friends... and that she told you about this much, they must see Rhodes Island as a lifeline of sorts.

Zuo Le:
In years past, so long as they stayed in line and broke no rules, the Sui Regulator would turn a blind eye to whatever they did.

Zuo Le:
But nowadays, things are different.

Zuo Le:
Not only are the times changing, you are on friendly terms with Nian, and you even brought Dusk off her mountain. That put you on the Sui Regulator's wrong side.

Kroos:
We were just...

Zuo Le:
I know you meant no ill will, but what comes next?

Zuo Le:
How is Great Yan meant to know that they are not planning anything when they are all in one place?

Kroos:
'Great Yan...'

Zuo Le:
I'm not trying to exaggerate.

Zuo Le:
Nian and Dusk disappeared not long after they reached Shangshu, and it just so happens that a goblet associated with them made its way here around the same time. Furthermore, the man of the hour is on Rhodes Island's side.

Zuo Le:
This is a tremendous coincidence. Wouldn't you say so, Miss Kroos?

Kroos:
......

Zuo Le:
And I'm not one to believe in coincidences.

Inn Assistant:
Oof!

Inn Assistant:
I forgot to hang the clothes to dry. Oh no, oh no... If I don't get to that now, there won't be anything to wear tomorrow.

Inn Assistant:
Shang Zhong, huh? You shouldn't have come.

Pole-Carrier:
......

Inn Assistant:
Now get lost. I'll pretend I didn't see you.

Pole-Carrier:
There was a young man who asked me to look for a pavilion in the mountains.

Inn Assistant:
We all know things were complicated when you left, but not only did you leave us without an explanation, you even set the innkeeper up. Going by the rules, that makes you a traitor.

Pole-Carrier:
Then your men surrounded him.

Inn Assistant:
Please, traitor, Brother Shang, I'm begging you. If anyone sees us, things will get hairy. Let's put a stop to this.

Pole-Carrier:
Who is that man?

Inn Assistant:
Brother Shang!

Pole-Carrier:
I'm asking you, who is that man?

Inn Assistant:
The Lungmenite...?

Pole-Carrier:
Yes.

Inn Assistant:
It's all business. It's got nothing to do with outsiders, and I have nothing to tell you.

Pole-Carrier:
It'll be ten full years at the end of this one. I've been thinking of giving the Association an explanation soon.

Pole-Carrier:
I'll give all of you an explanation.

Pole-Carrier:
I'll settle the score with Zheng Qingyue.

Inn Assistant:
I still can't tell you, Brother Shang!

Pole-Carrier:
Liu! Who pulled you out of the fire all those years ago?!

Inn Assistant:
I can't say.

Pole-Carrier:
It has to do with the goblet, doesn't it? The cup from ten years ago?

Inn Assistant:
You—

Pole-Carrier:
Bingo, then...

Pole-Carrier:
So that's the 'goblet' the kids have been talking about...

Inn Assistant:
Hey, you didn't interrogate any of the young disciples, did you—

Pole-Carrier:
This must be fate...

Inn Assistant:
—Hey, Shang Zhong! Don't just leave after you got that answer from me! Our years of friendship mean nothing to you, huh?! Hey!

Lee:
Hah, looks like you're a better drinker than you used to be.

Lee:
The Liang Xun of the good old days would probably be curling up into a ball under the table right about now.

Liang Xun:
I drink by myself every now and then.

Lee:
Well, that's our Magistrate Liang. You find the time to drink even as a government official—Hold on, you drink by yourself every now and then. That doesn't mean what I think it means, does it?

Liang Xun:
I drown my sorrows. It's human nature.

Lee:
They say that it takes a personality change to build your tolerance for alcohol. Wise words, don't you think?

Liang Xun:
It's a fair point.

Lee:
*Sigh*... When we drown our sorrows, it's a whole myriad of relationship we're trying to drown.

Lee:
To tell you the truth, I was actually pretty surprised when I saw you again.

Liang Xun:
Hm? Why is that?

Lee:
The Liang Xun I know is a methodical, taciturn fellow.

Lee:
I remember that time in school, outside the Chamber of Teachers Emeriti, when you said you were going to bless all under heaven. You said the world's a harsh, cold place, so you'd build a fire to warm everyone up, and they would never know darkness again.

Liang Xun:
I was just spouting words. We were young. Perhaps those were the exact words that led me to reflect on myself now.

Lee:
It was years ago.

Liang Xun:
Many years ago.

Liang Xun:
You aren't the refined young master you used to be either.

Lee:
Time flies, and I frittered all mine away.

Liang Xun:
It's been a long time since you left home. Have you spoken to your family?

Lee:
It hasn't been that long since I left home.

Liang Xun:
You're saying that detective agency in Lungmen is your home now?

Lee:
Of course.

Liang Xun:
What about back in Jiangdong?

Lee:
Jiangdong, or Kong Tung as we call it, is just a place with a house, some lanterns, and a few old friends.

Liang Xun:
We've both changed.

Lee:
I hope that when we clink our glasses together, it's not the sound of our past ambitions crumbling away that we hear.

Lee:
No, no, no, that's not quite right. You're a mandarin of some standing and the magistrate responsible for a city. If the masses are happy with you, perhaps you've already achieved your dreams?

Liang Xun:
We still have a long road ahead of us. Shangshu has always been a bustling place. What I'm trying to accomplish is just gilding the lily.

Lee:
I hope that you won't forget who we once were, then. Gon bui.

Liang Xun:
Gan bei.

Kroos:
Seems like Yan's research into occult mysticism is the greatest secret across this whole world.

Zuo Le:
You make it sound like we don't want to share.

Zuo Le:
They may take different forms, but all nations approach the same problem in their own way. Everyone faces this issue.

Zuo Le:
Though, because of certain... historical reasons, Great Yan's Sui Regulator happens to be at the forefront of 'Feranmutology.' Always has been. Always will be.

Zuo Le:
Kjerag still worships them as gods and Sami attempts to coexist with them, but the Sui Regulator's research has advanced to unparalleled heights.

Kroos:
So, the 'Sui' in Sui Regulator is the same 'Sui' that Nian talked about?

Zuo Le:
Did Nian tell you about those legends? The old emperor, the wild hunt, and what they uncovered?

Kroos:
(That's the stuff Lava talked about...)

Zuo Le:
In ancient times, the people thought of certain creatures as 'gods,' and with civilization's advancement, they gradually began to go into hiding.

Zuo Le:
The 'Sui' is one such creature.

Kroos:
'Certain creatures...?'

Zuo Le:
Whether they actually meet the definition of a living being is up for debate, and I don't suppose we need to go there.

Zuo Le:
All you need to know is that when at last they come to bring destruction to the world, Yan has the power to annihilate them. That's all.

Kroos:
Fair enough...

Zuo Le:
This is not exactly confidential Sui Regulator information, but it's not exactly common knowledge either.

Zuo Le:
I'm telling you all this not because I want a scholarly discussion.

Kroos:
......

Zuo Le:
Nian, Dusk, and the one who's in hiding somewhere in Shangshu. All of them are under the Sui Regulator's surveillance.

Zuo Le:
Normally, these things would not happen at such a pace. But then one day, the clouds all dissipated from that mountain. By the time the Sui Regulator Candleholders arrived, Dusk was nowhere to be found.

Kroos:
That happened just a few days ago.

Zuo Le:
It took only a few days for the Candleholders to brief the court on this matter too.

Kroos:
That's something... There's quite a bit of distance between Mount Hui-ch'i and the capital, isn't there?

Zuo Le:
Rhodes Island is getting itself involved without knowing the whole picture. The ignorant are blameless. On the contrary, it's unimaginable that you would work with those two without knowing anything.

Zuo Le:
And now, we would like Rhodes Island to follow the Sui Regulator's arrangement and persuade the Lungmenite to surrender the goblet himself.

Kroos:
I knew it... Liang Xun was under your thumb the whole time.

Zuo Le:
Correct.

Kroos:
He had Mr. Lee deliver the cup all the way from Lungmen to be stolen, and it's all a show, huh?

Zuo Le:
You call the magistrate by name, but gave the Lungmenite a courtesy title. That shows you are a good person.

Kroos:
Does being a good person mean anything else in Yan?

Zuo Le:
Please don't get the wrong idea. I'm not trying to beat around the bush. All I'm saying is that you aren't hiding your trust in the Lungmenite anymore. Is it because of his partnership with Rhodes Island?

Kroos:
It's actually more than that... He's a friend too.

Zuo Le:
There aren't many people we can truly call friends. It seems Nian and Dusk are your friends too.

Kroos:
It sounds like the Sui Regulator has some high standing in Yan. So why the ruse? Who are you trying to fool?

Zuo Le:
I'm afraid that's more than what Rhodes Island needs to know.

Kroos:
And you straight up admit that?

Zuo Le:
There's nothing to hide. It's just a more elegant way to go about this to save our mandarins some face.

Zuo Le:
Now that I've told Rhodes Island so much, can we set aside our differences and negotiate?

Kroos:
You want our help?

Zuo Le:
We'd like Mr. Lee's too.

Kroos:
What do you need help with?

Zuo Le:
The elimination of the Sui.

Lee:
I'm not drunk. No need to hold me like this.

Liang Xun:
You're my guest.

Lee:
I'm just a grunt you summoned from Lungmen.

Liang Xun:
I actually considered the possibility that the Messenger might not be able to find you in Lungmen.

Lee:
And I actually registered my agency in Lungmen hoping that you would find me.

Liang Xun:
'Lee's Detective Agency.' Why did you choose to build your business in Lungmen, though?

Lee:
It's the farthest away I could get from Yan.

Lee:
Any farther than that... I have no place to go.

Liang Xun:
You could come back.

Lee:
I don't want to.

Lee:
Liang Xun.

Liang Xun:
Hm...

Lee:
I know, actually.

Liang Xun:
You always knew.

Liang Xun:
Lungmen is not your home, yet you spent half your life holding out hope for Lungmen.

Lee:
I thought, there, I could finally find what it was that I wanted to do.

Liang Xun:
Did you?

Lee:
I did, but I also found that I could find it just about anywhere.

Liang Xun:
All those years ago, Huai Tianpei said he'd study kung fu and make a name for himself.

Lee:
And all those years ago, Liang Xun wanted to do something for all people under heaven, to change the ways of the world such that they would no longer have to be afraid.

Liang Xun:
What about you?

Lee:
I was just a finbeast in a river, and the moment I jumped a few chi out of the water, I felt I was at the top of the world.

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
Okay, I'm pooped. I've got a long day ahead of me tomorrow. You should get going.

Liang Xun:
Very well.

Liang Xun:
Take care.

Lee:
There's no more wine...

Lee:
*Sigh*.

Lee:
Old friends, old friends...

Lee:
Hmm...

......

......

An Indistinct Dream:
...A brilliant move.

Lee?:
......

An Indistinct Dream:
I see that I'm losing. I suppose there is no need to continue?

Lee?:
That's right.

Lee?:
There is no need to continue.

An Indistinct Dream:
There are more to the four arts than weiqi, and yet that's the one you always pick to challenge me. This is a form of bullying.

Lee?:
One man must avoid one's shortcomings.

Lee?:
And we both know I am no match for you in poetry and song.

An Indistinct Dream:
Fair.

An Indistinct Dream:
Lost interest already?

Lee?:
These are times of peace.

Lee?:
Though these times of peace are enjoyed only by Yan.

An Indistinct Dream:
Your stones are set only in Yan.

Lee?:
Correct. The board is entirely within Yan's borders.

Lee?:
Though I am not necessarily playing every round. In that case, the other games must take place elsewhere in the world too.

An Indistinct Dream:
Will those games have aught to do with you?

Lee?:
Real men remain silent as they spectate and never regret their moves.

An Indistinct Dream:
So all you do is spectate. You watch mankind as they wage wars and battle with each other.

Lee?:
I'm just learning the art of the game by spectating. Even children start to play by imitating.

An Indistinct Dream:
Hm...

An Indistinct Dream:
But you are not him.

Lee:
What do you mean?

An Indistinct Dream:
You... Oh, you are one of his pieces.

An Indistinct Dream:
Will you play in his stead, then? Mr. Lee of Lungmen?

Lee:
What...? I...?

An Indistinct Dream:
Hoh... This is peculiar.

An Indistinct Dream:
Why did he drag an ordinary man like you into this game?

An Indistinct Dream:
No, perhaps he didn't choose you in particular. He simply realized that things would come to this sooner or later, no matter who and no matter what?

Lee:
What are you talking about?

An Indistinct Dream:
I'm saying you are not the disheartened man, but you are sitting here in his stead, playing a game with me.

Lee:
Who are you...?

An Indistinct Dream:
Ling.

Lee:
What is this place?

An Indistinct Dream:
A dream... from a hundred years ago.

Lee:
Now that's funny. How could I have a dream that takes place a whole century ago...?

An Indistinct Dream:
Indeed...

An Indistinct Dream:
How could you?

Lee:
—!

Lee:
Hmm... It feels like I had quite the dream... Oh?

Voice Outside the Window:
Stop right there!

Lee:
That voice...
