Street Youth:
You haven't seen the innkeep anywhere?

Inn Assistant:
No.

Street Youth:
Weird. He's not at any other of the places, too. Did he finally figure to retire and kick back at home?

Inn Assistant:
If only.

Street Youth:
What's up, Liu, bud? Something got you down?

Inn Assistant:
I-I'm totally fine.

Inn Assistant:
Why do you ask?

Pole-Carrier:
—Your ability's—soil and stone Arts?

Taihe:
Precisely.

Taihe:
For all your martial talent, you're a shameful fool to not apply it for good.

Pole-Carrier:
Tying my hands with your sand, cracking my pole—what freak fighting style is that?

Taihe:
Your pole only lightly splitting against me makes it the strange one here. From whence did it come?

Pole-Carrier:
I only use ordinary young bamboo poles.

Taihe:
Then my style of engagement must completely lack rigor.

Pole-Carrier:
What's your name?

Taihe:
Taihe.

Pole-Carrier:
Fine name. Incredible.

Pole-Carrier:
It's lucky I could do battle with someone like you at the very end.

Pole-Carrier:
You're a mandarin, aren't you? Tell me, what are you planning, here, with the goblet?

Taihe:
Peace and prosperity in the realm for the ages to come.

Pole-Carrier:
Hahah, that's a grand statement!

Pole-Carrier:
But sadly, I still can't give this to you.

Taihe:
You've got nowhere to run.

Pole-Carrier:
So you say.

Taihe:
—You dare flee?!

The pole-carrier leaps one step backwards.

In ten years scaling the mountains, this is one step among hundreds of thousands.

Free as a kite that breaks from its string, he rises as the wind does.

Taihe:
Hmm. A hidden technique?

Pole-Carrier:
You won't catch me in the mountains.

Pole-Carrier:
Taihe, tell that boy. The Field of Forgotten Water, at the crest of Qujiang Peak.

Pole-Carrier:
Don't forget.

Taihe:
......

Zuo Le:
Uncle Taihe...!

Zuo Le:
You couldn't catch him?

Taihe:
It would be simple if I chased him with full vigor. But...

Zuo Le:
He's using the goblet as a threat, forcing Innkeeper Zheng to meet with him.

Taihe:
In the Field of Forgotten Water at the crest, the two will meet, and one must die.

Zuo Le:
Is there no leeway?

Taihe:
I learned its root in our fight just now. There is none whatsoever.

Zuo Le:
The Field of Forgotten Water, was it?

Zuo Le:
We need to seize the opportunity.

Lee:
We're lucky we didn't clash with that pole-carrier any. Seeing his moves reminds me of the last I ever saw Huai Tianpei ten whole years ago.

Miss Du:
......

Lee:
I assume you recognize those two there?

Miss Du:
I told you how my dad's on secret orders from the royal court. Those two are their officials.

Lee:
Do you know who they are, exactly?

Miss Du:
The giant lunk in the front's a bigshot from the Department of Discipline and Supervision, that's all I know.

Lee:
I see the picture, then.

Lee:
I'm not keen on troubling Rhodes Island any... but it looks like we'll need to borrow their power, after all...

Lee:
*Sigh* This does put a knot in things, though.

Miss Du:
What?

Lee:
I didn't hear what they were saying, but judging by the direction they hurried away, they're off to the summit.

Lee:
And I'm appointed to meet Rhodes Island at that very summit. Who ever knew the venue'd turn out quite like this.

Miss Du:
So do we ambush them at the summit first?

Lee:
Let's not. They're all fine fighters. We'd be asking for trouble.

Miss Du:
Well, what do we do, then—

Miss Du:
—Wait! Quick, hide in here! Don't poke your head out!

Lee:
Oh.

Lee:
The innkeeper?

Miss Du:
What's dad doing here...? And...

Lee:
You look ghastly pale.

Miss Du:
Is... Is he carrying his blade there?

Miss Du:
No, it's been so many years... he's never taken it out... he's...

Lee:
He's a swordfighter, is he?

Miss Du:
He used to be.

Lee:
Then it seems he's revived the trend.

Lee:
That's not encouraging.

Miss Du:
......

Lee:
Go.

Lee:
The closer to the peak, the narrower the road.

Boatman:
Nearly there now.

Kroos:
Is this the final path?

Boatman:
The very last one.

Boatman:
Beyond this village, a small ways west, you'll see a long, long stone stairway.

Boatman:
Past its top is the Field of Forgotten Water.

Kroos:
Hm?

Zuo Le:
Hm.

Taihe:
......

Kroos:
Well, there's a fine coincidence, meeting you all here.

Zuo Le:
Very much a happenstance.

Kroos:
What are you two after?

Zuo Le:
The goblet.

Kroos:
At the summit?

Zuo Le:
There's no point in hiding it now. Yes.

Zuo Le:
And someone unaccounted for has it.

Kroos:
Just what in the world is that cup?

Zuo Le:
If I told you, would you assist us in taking it back, Ms. Kroos?

Kroos:
There's a lot more to your goals than just 'taking it back.' You obviously want to use it for something.

Kroos:
And my guess is your goal happens to be the same as Mr. Lee's. You're all wanting to find its master.

Zuo Le:
......

Kroos:
So why go to all the trouble?

Zuo Le:
Are you asking us, Ms. Kroos, or... interrogating us?

Kroos:
I'm no interrogator, here.

Zuo Le:
This goblet was made by the hands of a great offender.

Kroos:
Offender?

Taihe:
The offense wide as the heavens.

Taihe:
Court classified. Don't look into it.

Kroos:
But you want to use this heaven-wide sinner's work to do something that involves Rhodes Island operators.

Kroos:
How am I meant to help out if you don't tell me?

Mr. Nothing:
My benefactor is quite right.

Mr. Nothing:
Though we may be of different standings, there's never any sense in withholding the details when you entrust affairs to people. The proverb puts it well; another's heart is hard to know. Treat each other with candor to get the matter resolved.

Kroos:
Here I was worried you'd gotten lost.

Mr. Nothing:
Ahahah. An informed concern, benefactor.

Zuo Le:
You treat them as your 'operators.'

Kroos:
We do.

Zuo Le:
......

The youth falls silent.

The youngest of the Sui Regulator's Candleholders, he must weigh the pros and cons, and make his choices.

It wouldn't be any startling revelation.

But he doesn't want any slip-ups made here.

Zuo Le:
A fearsome beast dwells in this goblet. It's only a portion of his consciousness, of course.

Taihe:
Lord Zuo.

Zuo Le:
I'm within my rights. If any ensuing liability falls on the Sui Regulator, you needn't have mercy, Uncle Taihe. Apply the legal proceedings.

Taihe:
......

Kroos:
Dwells?

Zuo Le:
Contemporary feranmutologists are in consensus that, aside from some form of corporealized body, walking in land beyond land, this ancient colossus also has means to dwell within certain objects.

Zuo Le:
The ancient literary saying, 'the beast walks with the generous earth,' actually gives some pointer as to these creatures' characteristics.

Kroos:
Er, does any old object work?

Zuo Le:
Weapons are fairly common. Whether it's ancient Sarkaz swords or modern, mass-produced staves, we have precedent.

Zuo Le:
But as for the concrete principle, we're still not sure.

Kroos:
Same goes for that goblet, then?

Zuo Le:
Wherever it goes, Waregeists spring up. We can't say we're certain yet, but we have grounds to suspect it.

Zuo Le:
The cup is alive, yet it hasn't come to life. The objects around it are all dead, yet live because of it.

Zuo Le:
It's been adrift for a long time. It's by a random chance we were able to determine its location.

Kroos:
So now you're out looking for that offender.

Zuo Le:
No.

Zuo Le:
I said, just now, its maker was guilty. But its present master is someone else entirely.

Kroos:
And just who is it?

Zuo Le:
A poet.

Miss Ning:
...My Lord.

Liang Xun:
Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
The wind is high today. The sun is setting early.

Liang Xun:
Early, but not so. The time came before I could notice.

Miss Ning:
How long has it been since last you climbed a mountain?

Liang Xun:
......

Miss Ning:
In antique times, the mountain chains of Shangshu were above human might.

Miss Ning:
Shu's paths try, as climbing atop the heavens.

Liang Xun:
It's different nowadays.

Miss Ning:
Yet for what difference tolls, some matters shall remain constant.

Miss Ning:
Nowhere in the Three Mounts and Seventeen Peaks may it be found. Will you still search, my Lord?

Liang Xun:
I need to.

Miss Ning:
You would balk at nothing, deceive me, deceive us all for this need?

Liang Xun:
I need to find it.

Miss Ning:
Why?

Miss Ning:
Surely you are aware that e'en justified thousandfold, to impinge is still to impinge, and to contravene is still to contravene?

Miss Ning:
Surely you know that should you err once, not only do you forfeit the future, but you bear the brunt of the guilt?

Liang Xun:
......

Miss Ning:
Surely you understand... I am willing to hear what you say?

Liang Xun:
I understand that.

Liang Xun:
It's all the more reason I cannot tell you.

Miss Ning:
Why?

Liang Xun:
Because as I serve as a city magistrate, I account for that single city's safety and life. Be it brick or tile or stove or kitchen, so long as the slightest harm comes to it, it is my failure in duty.

Liang Xun:
As those that tower above me disagree, all I may do... is try my hardest.

Miss Ning:
When first we met in Shangshu, in my early years, I saw that past your occasional obstinacy, you were principled and upright, of vitality whole. I have been staunch in my trust, that should we work as one, 'twould be no trouble we could not surmount.

Miss Ning:
Yet in this moment...

Miss Ning:
...I cannot help but be somewhat disappointed.

Liang Xun:
These words...

Liang Xun:
Are they words of warning, from my friend, Miss Ning, to me...

Liang Xun:
Or a supervisory pressuring, from the Imperial Envoy of Vice-Second Rank, the Assistant Minister of Rites, Ning Ciqiu, upon me?
