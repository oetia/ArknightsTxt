Passing Elder:
...Young man.

Street Youth:
Hm?

Passing Elder:
Can I ask the way to the estate of Liang, Magistrate of Shangshu?

Street Youth:
Uhh... it's close by, I think. Turn right there and keep going, and once you see the paifang arch, turn left and you're at the Liang estate.

Passing Elder:
Is it spacious?

Street Youth:
Who knows, I'm not allowed in.

Street Youth:
But from the outside... I think it doesn't look that different from any other place. Might even be a little run-down.

Passing Elder:
What does it say on the arch?

Street Youth:
I don't remember.

Passing Elder:
Thank you.

Street Youth:
Hey, old man.

Street Youth:
It's getting dark, how about I show you the way? You might get hit out here.

Passing Elder:
...No need.

Passing Elder:
I can see the way.

Mr. Nothing:
—Ugh!

Mr. Nothing:
(My foot... it's stuck in a rock?!)

Taihe:
That's enough.

Taihe:
You've lasted thirty-three moves. Commendable.

Mr. Nothing:
You never were pulling your true weight at all.

Taihe:
If you're interested in joining the army, your prospects will surely be bright.

Mr. Nothing:
Hahah... I'll admit I contemplated it when I left Kou-wu City, but the proverb puts it well: don't bite off more than you can chew. I'll repay Rhodes Island's grace to me for now.

Taihe:
To know grace and repay it. Qualities hard to come by.

Taihe:
A shame you're trapped in your situation.

Mr. Nothing:
In a literal sense, to boot.

Mr. Nothing:
(If I break my leg, maybe I can tug it out still... let's try it and see...)

Taihe:
Zheng Qingyue, I'll assist you!

Mr. Nothing:
Stop right there!

Taihe:
—!

Mr. Nothing:
*Pant*... *pant*...

Taihe:
You...

Taihe:
......

Taihe:
I regarded this tangle as a farce, and invested nothing in it.

Taihe:
But you've shown me I was wrong.

Innkeeper Zheng:
......

Pole-Carrier:
You've got less to say now.

Pole-Carrier:
You always had so little to say in the past.

Innkeeper Zheng:
......

Pole-Carrier:
Zheng Qingyue is only silent when going all-out. But when he goes all-out, no opponent escapes intact.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Are you done talking?

Pole-Carrier:
I'm only speaking to myself.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Huff...

Pole-Carrier:
It's raining...?

Pole-Carrier:
—!

Innkeeper Zheng:
What?!

Innkeeper Zheng:
(He broke Shang Zhong's staff so easily?! Before we could even react—how did he do it?)

Pole-Carrier:
—Who are you?!

Taihe:
A bamboo hat and raincoat, the rain as your sword.

Taihe:
Excellent kung fu.

Boatman:
Stop fighting. Stop, all of you.

Boatman:
Would it hurt to be a little peaceful?

Innkeeper Zheng:
......

Innkeeper Zheng:
Not to mention how capable they were. If they were willing to cause a commotion, they'd have won, and come out looking reasonable too.

Innkeeper Zheng:
You're the boatman who was with the Lungmenite since the beginning...

Taihe:
Of course. Liang Xun had two plans prepared.

Taihe:
He's deceived both the Sui Regulator and the Ministry of Rites.

Boatman:
*Sigh*... As an official, Mr. Liang has his restrictions. Don't you think the Sui Regulator's been too arbitrary this time?

Pole-Carrier:
It wouldn't be the Sui Regulator's first time, either.

Taihe:
......

Pole-Carrier:
My son died because of you. Don't forget it.

Boatman:
And why all the fighting for our lives here?

Pole-Carrier:
Hmph. Sticking your nose into this too. How capable do you think you are?

Boatman:
......

Mr. Nothing:
Hahah... making that hat such a permanent fixture always did strike me as awfully odd.

Mr. Nothing:
Unless, of course...

Taihe:
Shen Lou, this is Sui Regulator business. It's not yours to interfere in.

Boatman:
I'm just a passing boatman, encouraging you all to stop slaughtering each other here, from the goodness of my heart—

Boatman:
—and checking on the state of the summit. Mr. Liang asked me to take a look.

Innkeeper Zheng:
There were bandits terrorizing the border waterways in recent years. The court sent men to sort it out, cracking down like thunder. With a tianshi leading them, some of the best in the court infiltrated enemy lines.

Innkeeper Zheng:
In order to avoid alarming the enemy, the heroes pretended to be waterway bandits themselves, stealing into their den, rounding them all up at once.

Innkeeper Zheng:
—But when they came back out, they ran headfirst into a group of boaters who sought to stand up for justice. There was quite some misunderstanding.

Boatman:
*Sigh*...

Innkeeper Zheng:
They were hardly lifelong boaters, though, and the boat was just a skiff, approaching the waterside bandit den on its own.

Boatman:
No more, no more, I'll die of embarrassment... I'm not young anymore, and I didn't want to wade in for a fight like some brawler!

Taihe:
The people only knew that tianshis took the lead. They had no idea that others beyond could truly be calling the shots.

Taihe:
The Imperial Guard drillmaster appraised you quite highly.

Boatman:
Oh, that girl was so young, but her kung fu was incredible. I heard she'd already been helping train the other warriors. She would go far, very far...

Boatman:
But I'm not here today to reminisce.

Innkeeper Zheng:
An escort like me has only deep respect for you, Master Shen. No matter if it's our first meeting, I'd hear you out.

Innkeeper Zheng:
It's just that we're settling both public and personal bills today, and your word might not make it in... that's the size of it.

Boatman:
But I did agree with Mr. Liang that I'd express some things of my own.

Boatman:
No matter what the Department of Discipline and Supervision decides afterwards, I'll shoulder the burden. But for now, don't let any dogma here harm our friendships.

Pole-Carrier:
That won't fly.

Taihe:
If Liang Xun sent you, then this can't be as simple as a 'check.'

Boatman:
......

Taihe:
You plan to meddle in the Sui Regulator's affairs?

Boatman:
The Sui Regulator just wants to push Tianshi Bai into action. Does it make any difference if I act for him?

Taihe:
......

Mr. Nothing:
Master Shen, I'm on your side.

Mr. Nothing:
Friendship is wealth, they say.

Boatman:
Where's your benefactor?

Mr. Nothing:
Ahead for now.

Boatman:
That's fine—

Boatman:
—!

Taihe:
......!

Mr. Nothing:
Wh... What? Where did that summit and pavilion... come from?

Taihe:
......

Innkeeper Zheng:
That's what... we've all been looking for...

Boatman:
Here's hoping we can keep this under control...

Boatman:
...Or else we can only resort to violence.

Zuo Le:
Are you aware of what you're saying?

Nian:
I need your agency's help, young Candleholder. We should be in agreement about the stakes here.

Zuo Le:
Are you going to kill yourself?

Nian:
I'm not that out of it yet, but... things are getting tight.

Zuo Le:
Is Its mind not your minds?

Nian:
Of course not.

Nian:
It's about time we rose up against that giant self of ours.

Zuo Le:
All nonsense.

Zuo Le:
What ideas do you have?

Nian:
Are you willing to trust me?

Zuo Le:
I'm only obligated to hear out your idea. Whether I trust it, or not, is the Sui Regulator's decision.

Miss Ning:
You hold fine tastes, my Lord, to be admiring the snow in the mountains at this hour.

Liang Xun:
Here, sit.

Miss Ning:
You knew I would come.

Liang Xun:
Of course you would come.

Miss Ning:
When did the Sui Regulator first seek you?

Liang Xun:
A year ago.

Miss Ning:
On what matter?

Liang Xun:
Finding the goblet.

Miss Ning:
Merely finding it?

Liang Xun:
At first.

Zuo Le:
A year ago, Yan realized something.

Zuo Le:
Victoria's incidents. Ursus's endless unrest. One of Leithanien's Empresses losing her voice.

Zuo Le:
All under heaven was in turmoil, and Yan had to prepare.

Zuo Le:
The court met day after day, and passed the 'Twenty-Eight Policies.' Nothing unaccounted for, and not solely seeking the safety of Yan, but offering survival to the known world.

Zuo Le:
But outside of the Twenty-Eight Policies published, there were still hidden two more that needed Yan's urgent decision.

Nian:
...Hoh.

Nian:
What two?

Miss Ning:
There are wicked foreign spirits to the north, seas to the south, and ever more hidden dangers from Sui's bestializations.

Miss Ning:
All along, the Sui Regulator has advocated for initiative in settling this Feranmut problem.

Liang Xun:
The Ministry of Rites doesn't agree. Not at all.

Miss Ning:
The High Minister is indeed correct. There lies not only usable talent among those twelve... there are, above all else, several brilliant and virtuous.

Liang Xun:
But the Sui Regulator's very founding was aimed at sorting out the issue of this Feranmut.

Miss Ning:
Their opinion cannot be taken on all matters. The Sui Regulator was, at its founding, but subordinate to the Ministry of Rites.

Miss Ning:
It was only the disaster following that game of stones that elevated the Sui Regulator in position.

Liang Xun:
......

Miss Ning:
*Sigh*... It is a hidden malice of a thousand years, brewing calamity 'til today. To reckon with it is due.

Liang Xun:
But it's not the Sui Regulator's right to decide, nor for the Ministry of Rites to say.

Nian:
...The current Grand Tutor?

Zuo Le:
The Grand Tutor has met with that great offender.

Nian:
I see.

Nian:
Looks like I really did nap too long... So that's what the old guy's like?

Nian:
His physique was paper-thin, and he didn't seem like he knew Arts. I thought he was just some random nosy guy, poking into everybody's business.

Zuo Le:
The Grand Tutor mends the realm's affairs, inspecting for leaks and patching holes.

Nian:
Huh, I thought you'd get angry at me badmouthing the oldie.

Zuo Le:
Angry?

Zuo Le:
Would you show anger at a rascally child who blames the sky for raining?

Nian:
......

Lee:
(This boy... he's got a steely tongue...)

Kroos:
(That's the first time I've seen Nian get checked like that.)

Zuo Le:
The Grand Tutor gave the Sui Regulator a hidden aim. Something that must be accomplished, whether or not we openly chafe with the Ministry of Rites for it.

Nian:
Oh. And what's that?

Zuo Le:
Three things.

Miss Ning:
It is turning colder.

Liang Xun:
The mountains are always quicker to cool.

Miss Ning:
This mountain truly did not choose its scenery well. How does it keep hold of its customers?

Liang Xun:
How do you figure?

Miss Ning:
You cannot see the sunset.

Liang Xun:
That's fair.

Miss Ning:
Is it very arduous, that you do so much for the Sui Regulator, my Lord?

Liang Xun:
It's even more arduous hiding it from you, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
Three years ago, for the Ministry of Rites, I was sent to Shangshu to supervise Ling, who was suspected of settling here.

Miss Ning:
And you, magistrate of Shangshu, had more sway in reality than some of your ordinary colleagues, it is true.

Miss Ning:
I first thought you were inflexible, easily riled.

Liang Xun:
I must have amused you, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
My Lord, for what purpose have you done so much, over all these years?

Liang Xun:
My own outlook has never changed.

Liang Xun:
I do it seeking the wellbeing of the people of my home.

Miss Ning:
Hesitating not to deceive the Ministry of Rites and the Sui Regulator?

Liang Xun:
What could be more important than the people's safety?

Miss Ning:
You know the Ministry of Rites is prepared.

Liang Xun:
Spring thunder was always the emblem of the passing of winter. I wish not for its clap to reduce the Three Mounts' Seventeen Peaks by yet another.

Miss Ning:
You are as you ever were, my Lord.

Miss Ning:
But you still are not willing to face me, in the end.

Liang Xun:
How could I?

Miss Ning:
And how could you not? Your behavior is all too clear.

Liang Xun:
Our ranks are different. Our posts burden us.

Liang Xun:
But if...

Miss Ning:
...Mm?

Liang Xun:
If you come as no more than Miss Ning, then I, Liang, would be more than glad to.

Miss Ning:
......

Miss Ning:
So such... openness... is also within your capacity.

Liang Xun lifts his teacup.

No tea is within, but still he takes a long drink from it.

Nian:
...Three things?

Zuo Le:
First, retrieve the goblet. We don't know why, but he spilled all to the Grand Tutor as to the cup's origins and rough whereabouts.

Nian:
And you weren't worried it was a trap?

Zuo Le:
Second, aside from preserving the two hidden policies, find an even more reliable proposal, to keep this situation suppressed to a minimum.

Nian:
Oh... Yan always comes off real cautious whenever you touch on the folk of the realm.

Zuo Le:
Third...

Nian:
Go on.

Zuo Le:
No matter who they are, should more than three proxies gather on one side, pass on personal handwritten instructions from the Grand Tutor.

Nian:
Handwritten instructions?

Zuo Le:
Correct.

Zuo Le:
So, I ask, Where is Dusk?

Miss Du:
Ugh... how did I...

Miss Du:
Hm?

Dusk:
......

Miss Du:
Wh-Who are you...

Dusk:
I forgot about you.

Dusk:
Whatever. Someone knocked you out.

Miss Du:
—!

Miss Du:
Wh-Where's dad? And Shang Zhong?! And that giant bull—

Dusk:
Don't bother looking.

Dusk:
You won't find them.

Taihe:
This is...

Pole-Carrier:
Hmm...

Innkeeper Zheng:
So she could alter heaven and earth in the blink of an eye...

Innkeeper Zheng:
That woman who suddenly appeared... Just what could her game be?

Ink Spirit:
Gkh...

Mr. Nothing:
You're joking! Not again?!

Miss Du:
Th... They're in a painting?

Miss Du:
What do you mean?

Dusk:
You wouldn't understand, even if I told you.

Miss Du:
W-Wait, where are you going?

Dusk:
The summit.

Miss Du:
But isn't the Field of Forgotten Water right th—

Miss Du:
—When did... that pavilion appear?

Dusk:
It came from time immemorial.

Waregeist:
Ao—!

Miss Du:
Eek!

Dusk:
Hmph.

Dusk:
These things... Is she imitating me with these things, to mock me?

Nian:
...You really don't know how to cut slack.

Zuo Le:
This is my duty.

Nian:
I have a question. Just a question, okay?

Nian:
If I don't go along with you, what'll the Sui Regulator do?

Zuo Le:
They'll simply do again what was done a millennium ago.

Zuo Le:
Moreover, now, we are strong, and your powers feeble.

Nian:
...Hoh.

Zuo Le:
The Sui Regulator's principles are simple. Finish it once and for all, and forever rid the future of plague.

Nian:
And that's why I'm telling you, we've got the same stakes in this as you.

Zuo Le:
You're only scheming to allow yourself escape.

Zuo Le:
Even if I believed you, why should I believe you can accomplish this preposterousness?

Zuo Le:
If you can't, then how much unnecessary danger will your existence engender? Doesn't the Sui Regulator have an even more 'dependable' plan to solve this problem?

Zuo Le:
You cannot convince me.

Nian:
Looks like we're at a deadlock.

Nian:
What do you think?

Dusk:
Are you asking me? You could just go ask the one you were looking for.

Zuo Le:
You must be...

Dusk:
I see.

Dusk:
So this is his supposed big idea?

Zuo Le:
What do you mean?

Dusk:
You're the one who doesn't know anything at all, boy.

Dusk:
If you don't want three hundred years of standing in the corner, then don't give me that look.

Zuo Le:
......

Kroos:
D-Dusk, it's alright, calm down...

Dusk:
Hmph.

Zuo Le:
You know how this goblet came about.

Zuo Le:
Hand it over.

Lee:
You tasked Liang Xun with it, Liang Xun tasked me. If you want the cup, I think you should go ask Liang Xun for it.

Zuo Le:
You understand reason, Mr. Lee. You should know the severity of this.

Lee:
I'm sure Liang Xun has his reasons.

Zuo Le:
If Ning Ciqiu doesn't give a reasonable explanation, Liang Xun will pay for his unilateral action.

Lee:
Hm.

Nian:
Okay, we can dial down the aggression once in a while, little buddy. If the Sui Regulator's so thirsty to have this...

Nian:
Wait.

Nian:
Why does the Sui Regulator want this goblet so bad again?

Dusk:
It's that weiqi weirdo's scheme, probably. He's bored enough to—

Dusk:
—No... he's not like this.

Dusk:
Is he actually still locked in the capital...? What happened?

Zuo Le:
......

Zuo Le:
The last time the Sui Regulator neared that shrine, a body was discovered inside it.

Zuo Le:
It was Grandmaster Xiang Ru. Heart failure, died while vomiting blood. The weiqi board was empty, save for a single black stone at the center.

Nian:
Didn't you say you had a whole taboo about meeting him?

Zuo Le:
The Sui Regulator is investigating it.

Zuo Le:
But this goblet, without a doubt, is a crucial key to uncovering his plot. And the two of you, Miss Nian, Miss Dusk...

Zuo Le:
The Sui Regulator wishes for you to come with us.

Kroos:
Ahahah, now that's getting a little complicated...

Nian:
Tch.

Nian:
Is he really a step ahead of us?

Dusk:
Why limit yourself to one step?

Dusk:
No wonder the old man was so overbearing.

Zuo Le:
In that case... how about Miss Ling?

Zuo Le:
The Sui Regulator records that he disagrees with all the other bestials, willing only to recite poetry and make merry with Ling and Shu.

Zuo Le:
If she still won't show herself, then the Sui Regulator's only option is to—

???:
...Mmm...

???:
Do you seek me?

Her gaze is at the setting sun.

Crossing the immemorial, and other times besides.

For in truth, time is a place.

A place only the free and unshackled can halt their step in.

Ling:
Phew... aaahh... come, look now at this view.

Ling:
The sun is through, and water runs yet long... while snowfall flows through moonlit vacant sky.

Ling:
The setting light sets clouds ablaze. How charming, yea, how fine.

Ling:
With such beautiful scenery, why still must you persist with such unjoyful topics?

Zuo Le:
When did...

Ling:
Mm, you and your father in his younger years do seem so alike. And yet...

Ling:
You could turn a blind eye to this, to a sky of endless twilight clouds?

Ling:
Have you never been alive upon this land?

Nian:
Okay, keep applauding the sunset in a moment.

Nian:
I spent a looooot of effort hauling Dusk out to find you, and I didn't do it just to hear you wax poetic.

Dusk:
......

Ling:
Long time no see, Nian, Dusk.

Ling:
And you.

Lee:
Me?

Nian:
Huh? You and old Lee know each other?

Ling:
No.

Ling:
Prior to this...

Lee?:
—

Ling:
Do such lowly means not insult your character some?

Lee?:
I couldn't get it past you.

Lee?:
But I never imagined you'd see through me in an instant.

Ling:
Whose path did you think you walked?

Lee?:
I wasn't banking on truly fooling you.

Lee?:
And besides, he's the one who daydreamed. The one who met him in a dream was only me.

Lee?:
Isn't this a game I learned from you?

Ling:
Myself I stay when I awake; the butterfly it stays in dreams.

Ling:
But will it be him still, when he comes to?

Lee?:
Who knows.

Ling:
It is beyond you.

Lee?:
How dearly rude, Ling.

Ling:
If you have the true capability, go bicker so with our eldest brother. Why the cruel trickery on a common human?

Lee?:
Those of different ways cannot plan for one another.

Ling:
Hm? So you and I are of the same way? Why did I not know?

Lee?:
For how vivid your toast-drinking and revelry was, you're quite merciless.

Lee?:
Which is right. After all, you've thrown away... that goblet I sent you.

Ling:
Could I ever? It was simply a moment's distraction, while singing to the moons.

Ling:
I should be the one disappointed. At that time, you had far in advance... laid one stone.

Lee?:
Hmph... hahah...

Ling:
And what do you laugh at?

Lee?:
Nian's own overestimation. Dusk's timid impotence. Your uninvolvement. And myself, for considering myself so infallible.

Ling:
You...

Ling:
...You truly wish to substitute?

Ling:
......

Lee:
Hm? What is it? What are you looking at me for?

Ling:
No, it is only me seeing through a dull game.

Ling:
What did you seek me for?

Nian:
What, we can't just pay you a nice little visit, Ling?

Dusk:
You fell asleep?

Ling:
Hm?

Dusk:
I'm asking. Did you fall asleep?

Dusk:
How are you able to—

Ling:
When drunk, I simply sleep.

Ling:
What of it?

Dusk:
......

Nian:
......

Dusk:
How did you do it?

Ling:
You ask how I did it... ah, I understand.

Ling:
You cannot fall asleep, can you? My poor little sister.

Ling:
Is it because you fear to have nightmares?

Dusk:
If it can even be called a nightmare.

Ling:
Mm... In many years, we have not met.

Ling:
So such things are vexing you. And your paintings? Could your paintings not bear the weight of your dreams?

Ling:
No... is it that you finally began to feel, that paintings—are but false?

Dusk:
You...

Dusk:
Ah! Hey, don't mess with my paintings!

Nian:
You bundled all those guys below us into your little world, I'm guessing.

Ling:
And what for... Crude mounts, parched waters. A heart like unto ashes.

Ling:
How dull.

Ink Spirit:
Gkh...?

Ling:
But these adorable minor scrawls, these I still find so amusing.

Ling:
What need you feed them?

Nian:
You should know what we're here to do.

Ling:
...Nian.

Ling:
By your idea, where will our course ultimately be taken?

Dusk:
......

Nian:
Don't stare at me like that. I'm thinking about it here, alright...

Nian:
But right now, I still don't know.

Ling:
You don't know, then... mm... you do not know.

Ling:
Not the finest of plans.

Ling:
Dusk. That scroll all filled with matter in death. It is stagnant, stuck. Somewhat boring. Be rid of it, perhaps.

Dusk:
You don't get to tell me just like that.

Ling:
Forget not her at the outset, who gave you all true names in one lone word, and what hopes she had for you.

Dusk:
Ancient history by now.

Zuo Le:
What did you just...

Ling:
Nothing. Only a moment of bliss snatched, away and apart from this world.

Ling:
The Grand Tutor had something for you to hand to me, no?

Zuo Le:
This and that are independent. Even once you see his instructions, you must still behave and come with the Sui Regulator.

Ling:
All to find him. Find that... basket of blunders.

Zuo Le:
Indeed.

Zuo Le:
Take it.

Ling:
Oh? A letter?

Ling:
Your so-called Grand Tutor's instructions... no.

Ling:
This handwriting... would it be him...?

Ling:
The Grand Tutor is an ever stern one. He would never draft instructions in such flowing script... Did he tell you no more?

Zuo Le:
My duty is solely to give the letter.

Ling:
A letter of the court... the first in a long time.

Ling:
...Heheh.

Nian:
Is it to us? When did humanity ever get the guts for that? I thought only the True Lung and his little posse would work that sort of courage up.

Ling:
Then you look at its contents.

Nian:
Hm?

Nian:
......!

Ling:
...One affair no more than thrice, I see.

Nian:
Okay, I get it. Yeah, we sure do fit that bill right now.

Dusk:
A fulfilled omen...? That decrepit Grand Tutor couldn't have written this!

Nian:
This handwriting looks like Jie's, but she already... could someone else have copied her, somehow? But why do it as the Grand Tutor's 'instructions?'

Ling:
It was that basket of blunders. It seems in recent years, he's 'written' no shortage of things.

Ling:
I thought he was obstinate, that it would only be right he incur Yan's flames... and now this written orders, is another move of his? And why should the Grand Tutor send the letter in his stead...?

Dusk:
Hey!

Ling:
Unless... the Grand Tutor chose to play white?

Dusk:
Hey! Stop mumbling to yourself!

The three lapse into silence.

Though they have existed for so long, the sisters are momentarily stupefied.

The wind blows from primordial to present, this time no longer this moment.

Dusk:
...Tha—That's...

Dusk:
I—Impossible... Is even this something he can do...

Nian:
Don't ask me...

Nian:
But, well... even if it's just a reflection... I don't like how it's looking at us.

Ling:
......

Nian:
Dusk, you scared?

Dusk:
Don't you always have plenty of ideas? Think of something.

Nian:
Hey, Ling.

Nian:
We've gotta band together—what are you doing?

Ling:
Something suddenly came to me. Last I fell dead drunk, I should have left two vessels of wine here... there, there they are.

Ling:
Husong? Mm... the flavor is still fine to the nose.

Dusk:
If you're so cool, do you have any solutions?!

Ling:
Solutions? What solutions?

Dusk:
Solutions to deal with It—

Ling:
—A solution to address Ourself? Need I tell you?

Dusk:
I...

Nian:
You're not just going to sit on the sidelines this time, are you?

Ling:
I hardly could.

Ling:
We meet again.

Ling:
On this turn, do I dream of you, or do you dream of me?

'Sui-Xiang':
......

By her tail, Ling lifts the jar half full of fine wine, and pours it forth into the cup, meant for the one who seems the culprit of it all.

She lifts it to the heavens.

Ling:
Shall we drink?

Lee?:
I will refrain.

Lee?:
May you all come one by one, and take your seats,

Lee:
Ah...! What happened?

Lee:
Where are we?

Kroos:
This feeling—it's just like being in one of Dusk's paintings...

Zuo Le:
In that case... who are you?

The night parts as a curtain.

A silhouette sits straight within the center of the room.

Behind him is hung half a scroll.

'The Way to Paradise.'

Lee?:
If you have nothing to do...

Lee?:
What say you chat over a game with me?
