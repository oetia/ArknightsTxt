Miss Du:
...Cheh.

Mr. Nothing:
Hm? What's this pause for?

Mr. Nothing:
Don't tell me I was a little too heavy-handed, and hurt you in my carelessness, young lady?

Miss Du:
Hmph. So you know some flowery kung fu. Happy?

Miss Du:
Your buccaneer's already fled on us, so there's no sense tangling with you any longer, you—

Miss Du:
—What's your name?

Mr. Nothing:
Nothing. The latter man of Tzu-hsu and Wu-yu.

Miss Du:
Keh. What kind of conman gives his real name? That must be some stupid kung fu stage name.

Mr. Nothing:
Ah, how keen-witted you are.

Miss Du:
So you're not going to let me past to chase them, right?

Mr. Nothing:
Hence why I compliment your keen wit.

Miss Du:
Shut it with your flapping!

Street Youth:
What are you waiting for?! Let's take him!

Street Youth:
Miss! We'll help you out!

Innkeeper Zheng:
—Hold it!

Street Youth:
Eep...

Innkeeper Zheng:
Ahem.

Innkeeper Zheng:
This is still an inn. I can't have you two making a mess of the restaurant and fools of us all. What will the passersby think?

Miss Du:
...Cheh.

Innkeeper Zheng:
However, you two fought marvelously. In honor of your eye-opening display, I... won't ask you to cover the costs.

Innkeeper Zheng:
But for now, please rein it in. Call it a day. For my sake.

Miss Du:
Hmph.

Mr. Nothing:
Do pardon us, good proprietor. We'll resolve this misunderstanding forthwith, then make amends at your door.

Miss Du:
I'll let you go... this time. For the innkeep.

Miss Du:
I don't know how you're involved with that guy, but I'd hand him over if I were you.

Miss Du:
Cover for him and you're an accomplice. You're free to go for now, but Shangshu doesn't tolerate outlaws.

Mr. Nothing:
If this were simply a matter of outlawry, you could have called the police. What has you resorting to force, Miss Du?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Nothing is right. No matter the reason, a mere disagreement shouldn't bring you to fisticuffs.

Miss Du:
Why you...!

Innkeeper Zheng:
Now, now, Miss.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Let's have your people leave.

Street Youth:
M-Miss, do we just let him go...? We could grab him, then wait for the Lungmenite to take the bait—

Miss Du:
Quiet.

Miss Du:
We've already let the Lungmenite escape. Keeping this guy with us all night wouldn't be much use.

Miss Du:
Besides, could you even restrain him? And you, you're still holding back some moves, aren't you?

Mr. Nothing:
Hardly. Friendship is wealth, now, friendship is wealth. If the young lady here is willing to take a step back, then I couldn't ask for anything more...

Miss Du:
I won't forget this, Nothing.

Mr. Nothing:
Please, don't waste your memories on me. The esteemed have so much to forget.

Mr. Nothing:
(Carefully, carefully... Good, I'll get a decent head start from here.)

Miss Du:
I'm only listening to Mr. Zheng—if you want to see how things play out outside, be my guest. I suggest you sit tight and listen to—

Miss Du:
—Hey! Where'd he go?!

Miss Du:
H-How did this happen?! What are you all DOING?!

Street Youth:
Er... you weren't exactly clear on whether we were letting him go, Miss...

Miss Du:
Don't just stand there! After him!

Street Youth:
Y-Yes, Miss!

Inn Assistant:
Hey, Miss Du, don't you think you're making too big of a mess?

Miss Du:
Out of my way!

Inn Assistant:
Ai, ai, don't—whatever, this isn't my problem anymore...

Miss Du:
And Dad! Why were acting like this doesn't concern you? You even stopped me!

Innkeeper Zheng:
You were making trouble.

Miss Du:
Trouble, my ass! You knew they'd go through Yingfeng Road, right? Isn't that why you were here waiting for them?!

Miss Du:
We've got eyes in dozens of inns and eateries in this city! Catching some blind idiot of a thief's not hard—

Innkeeper Zheng:
Who's the blind idiot here?

Miss Du:
......!

Innkeeper Zheng:
You don't know what that wine cup is, let alone what that Lungmenite might have up his sleeve.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Not to mention how capable those people were. If they were willing to cause a commotion, they'd have won, and come out looking reasonable too.

Miss Du:
But––

Innkeeper Zheng:
But what? Do you know just how significant their mission is? Or who the anonymous client is?

Innkeeper Zheng:
You think you're all it takes to put hired escorts to shame?

Boatman:
Looks like no one's following.

Boatman:
Sorry everyone. I should've been leading the way, but here we are in this plight.

Boatman:
I never imagined something like this would await us in Shangshu City though...

Boatman:
Was it really alright to leave that young man alone? Have we abandoned him?

Lee:
The innkeeper and the pushy woman seemed to know each other. I'm worried our rearguard hero might not slip away so easily.

Kroos:
Huh... how do you figure, Mr. Lee?

Lee:
She was clearly mindful of him while making her move. That'd never fool me.

Lee:
Get fooled in my line of work, and you're out business.

Kroos:
Oh...

Kroos:
Then we can only hope he's a fast runner. And honestly, I'd vouch for that.

Boatman:
Will he really be okay?

Kroos:
He'll be right as rain. The girl wouldn't dare to make a scene in broad daylight, right? It's a quiet street, but SOMEONE's gonna notice.

Lee:
Phew... That's a relief. But fancy meeting you Rhodes Islanders here.

Kroos:
And what brings you to Shangshu, Mr. Lee? Commission at your office?

Lee:
I suppose. Just a private matter entrusted to me by an old friend though.

Kroos:
Is it that box?

Lee:
That it is.

Boatman:
But this truly is bizarre. Why would anyone in Shangshu dare to steal Mr. Liang's property?

Lee:
It's not bizarre at all. If we could slip into Shangshu without a fuss, why would our Mr. Liang have bothered to seek me out?

Kroos:
Mr. Liang?

Lee:
An old schoolmate... You can think of him as the Wei Yenwu of Shangshu.

Kroos:
Wow then... Mr. Wei, huh...

Boatman:
By the sound of it, you all know Lord Wei of Lungmen quite well?

Lee:
Maybe the average man on the street wouldn't, but those of us sifting through Lungmen's scraps? Sure, we all do.

Boatman:
Recognizing Lord Wei and being recognized by him are very different things.

Lee:
You're not wrong, but let's leave me and Wei Yenwu's somewhat rocky relationship out of this.

Boatman:
Ah. A shame I'll never meet anyone of Lord Wei's caliber.

Lee:
Sure, he's extraordinary, but not THAT extraordinary.

Kroos:
You're kinda making it sound like Mr. Liang's no big deal by comparison.

Lee:
Does he count as a big deal?

Boatman:
He does. Why wouldn't he?

Boatman:
Wait, do you mean Lord Wei of Lungmen doesn't, or Mr. Liang doesn't?

Lee:
Then I suppose everyone's a big deal these days, tut-tut-tut. Back then, he was just a hothead who didn't even know the meaning of the word 'adapt'.

Kroos:
You're the same as ever, huh Mr. Lee?

Lee:
Hah. What's it matter now, with me eking out my days in Lungmen while he officiates all of Shangshu? We haven't met in forever.

Boatman:
Look, there. It's that young man.

Kroos:
Nothing! Alright, mate?

Mr. Nothing:
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Hands off, I'm aching all over...

Mr. Nothing:
You may not realize this, but that young girl just now went utterly berserk! Merely warding her off tested every bone in me, and it was only by the proprietor's timely intervention that I had a gap through which to scurry—

Kroos:
With the way you came running over, you're obviously completely fine.

Kroos:
Fan tucked in hand and everything. So care to repeat that? Tested every bone?

Mr. Nothing:
Erk... There's no fooling you, benefactor... I will say, though, it's been far too long since I last used so many moves. The muscle ache alone is...

Lee:
And this young man is?

Kroos:
Operator Mr. Nothing.

Mr. Nothing:
I may not have formally taken the post, but my devoted heart and tireless efforts have long since beaten to Rhodes Island's tune.

Lee:
So you're a new operator friend. Good to meet you.

Mr. Nothing:
Well met, well met. I hear from my benefactor that you're also an ally to Rhodes Island? Ah, as expected of Rhodes Island, friend to all and beloved by the masses, that they'd strike an accord with a fine soul like yourself, er...

Lee:
Just call me old Lee.

Mr. Nothing:
How kind of you, Brother Lee.

Lee:
Well then, brother. You say you only got out once the innkeeper intervened?

Mr. Nothing:
Precisely so. What of it?

Lee:
Hmm... seems things aren't as simple as I thought.

Boatman:
This isn't the place to stand and chat, too many ears. I'd never forgive myself for another setback.

Lee:
Then we'll head straight for the Liang estate.

Lee:
As for our friends...

Boatman:
I was only told to meet with you. Bringing any more could be a little...

Boatman:
Ah, never mind.

Boatman:
I doubt Mr. Liang's so small-minded. And you did both help us out, so we'll go together.

Kroos:
The Liang estate, huh... I'd really rather not bother anyone else...

Lee:
It's fine, you're with me.

Mr. Nothing:
Decisive words, Brother Lee.

Boatman:
Good... if that's settled, then let's be quick. Come, this way.

Lee:
......!

Mr. Nothing:
Brother Lee?

Lee:
Hmm? Ah... I'll be right there.

Lee:
......

Lee:
Oh...

Strange Object:
......

Strange Object:
Ao?

Lee:
What's this...? Are these strange pets the new trend in Shangshu?

Strange Object:
Ao!

Mr. Nothing:
Brother Lee! Don't fall behind!

Lee:
...I'm coming, I'm coming.

Strange Object:
Ao...
