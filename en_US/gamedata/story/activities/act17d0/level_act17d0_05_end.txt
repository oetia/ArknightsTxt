Frost:
Find anything?

Ash:
Got something! It's not much, but it's something.

Rangers:
Good work. These provisions, along with the emergency store in the safehouse, should keep us fed for a week, if we stretch it.

Ash:
It's getting late. Let's head back.

Schwarz:
...Someone's coming.

Rangers:
How many?

Schwarz:
...A dozen maybe. Could be mercenaries.

Rangers:
Hurry! Back to the safehouse!

Rangers:
Are they still on us?

Schwarz:
...Yes.

Rangers:
That's not good.

Ash:
I knew they wouldn't let up.

Rangers:
We are bound to get sieged if we choose to fight here. Keep retreating.

Tachanka:
What happened?

Ash:
We've got company. Get ready to fight.

Schwarz:
Something's not right...

Schwarz:
...Hold your fire...

Tachanka:
Why?

Schwarz:
...It's not those mercenaries.

Schwarz:
...They're Reproba soldiers...

Rangers:
Local guards?

Rangers:
Hold fire!

Picale:
Guards, surround the structure! Don't let anyone escape.

Blitz:
Wait a second, are we surrounded?

Rangers:
...This isn't good.

Liskarm:
Why are the Lord's men encircling us?

Rangers:
Let's have you quiet down for now.

Picale:
I want all of you inside to listen up!

Picale:
I am the captain of the Long Spring village guard, daughter of the Lord of Long Spring, Picale Tulla.

Picale:
I want you all to lay down your weapons and come out nice and easy.

Picale:
Don't test my patience. You'll regret it.

Picale:
Mercenaries. It's always mercenaries.

Picale:
You shameless, faithless, virtueless bastards. How much gold did my evil brother give you?

Picale:
You won't get away. I'll crush you. I'll stomp you into dust.

Picale:
I'll make you pay for everything you've done.

Picale:
Once I cut you down, you'll finally understand that no amount of blood money can buy you another life!

Blitz:
Oh! Oh! Are you sure they're here to help?

Blitz:
I think they'd rather hang us from the town gate.

Ash:
That's what I'm afraid of.

Rangers:
There's definitely a misunderstanding here.

Rangers:
Lady Picale.

Rangers:
I'm a field operator with Rhodes Island, code name Rangers.

Rangers:
I'm pretty sure Rhodes Island signed a cooperation agreement with your family.

Rangers:
We're...

Picale:
Shut up!

Picale:
Rhodes Island! Sanctimonious hypocrites!

Picale:
My father trusted you! He believed your promises. That's why he agreed to your safehouse.

Picale:
And how did you repay him?

Picale:
You kidnapped our people! Robbed them of everything they had! I saw it!

Picale:
You're a bunch of treacherous villains!

Ash:
If you think for a single second, you'll know that doesn't make any sense.

Ash:
If we wanted to pillage the town, why would we still be here?

Picale:
Don't try to talk your way out of this!

Picale:
And who the hell are you?

Picale:
You're standing on my father's land with your guns, and you dare to argue with me?!

Ash:
If you're so tough, where have you been all this time?

Ash:
You and the Lord's men let those thugs raid the quarantine zone so we had to risk our lives to save the townsfolk in there. What were your precious guardsmen doing then?

Ash:
And you still think you can come here and talk a big game with us?

Tachanka:
Settle down. She doesn't seem like the type you can reason with.

Miarow:
Lady Picale!

Miarow:
I'm Dr. Miarow, from the Infected quarter! We've met before!

Picale:
...Right. I know you.

Miarow:
Rhodes Island didn't rob the Infected. I can testify to that! We were forced here by the riots.

Miarow:
And it's not just me. Any of the Infected here will tell you that.

Miarow:
Lady Picale, I need you to trust me.

Picale:
......

Picale:
...I trust you, Doctor. Many people speak highly of you.

Miarow:
Thank you, Lady Picale.

Picale:
But I don't trust them!

Picale:
It is a grave infraction to enter my father's territory, armed, without permission!

Picale:
In light of you protecting my father's subjects...

Picale:
I will pardon you for that infraction.

Picale:
As for Rhodes Island! The contract you signed with my father is, as of today, null and void.

Rangers:
...Please reconsider.

Picale:
There is nothing to discuss!

Picale:
Long Spring does not need armed foreigners, not even Rhodes Islanders!

Picale:
I will gather up the Infected and take them where they belong.

Picale:
We don't need you getting involved.

Liskarm:
But...

Rangers:
Alright. Don't speak.

Rangers:
Do not defy the local Lord. We are standing here at Sargon as Rhodes Island operators.

Liskarm:
......

Lord's Guard:
Forty-one, forty-two...

Lord's Guard:
Any others?

Miarow:
That's all...

Lord's Guard:
No problem. We'll get you to safety.

Miarow:
Miss Cohen, Mr. Alexsandr.

Miarow:
Thank you for all that you've done.

Ash:
No need. We should be thanking you.

Miarow:
Where are you going to go?

Ash:
Not sure yet.

Tachanka:
Let's not make it sound so sad.

Tachanka:
Maybe we'll meet again someday.

Tachanka:
I'll have to tell you about it next time...

Lord's Guard:
?

Tachanka:
*Cough* *cough*... the story of the dog-headed man.

Miarow:
Hahaha... alright.

Rangers:
Doctor, this is for you.

Miarow:
It's... an Originium Ingot. But I can't...

Rangers:
Remuneration. For Occphen's leg.

Miarow:
That was just some basic first aid... it's not worth this much...

Rangers:
I think it's worth it. Take it.

Miarow:
Thanks, Mr. Rangers.

Miarow:
And... thank you all.

Miarow:
Goodbye.

Schwarz:
......

Rangers:
......

Schwarz:
Something's off.

Rangers:
I know.

Rangers:
*Sigh*. I thought caution was the right move, but we ended up with a big misunderstanding.

Liskarm:
Who would've thought the captain of the guard would be so difficult?

Franka:
A muscle-headed moron. We have enough of those at BSW.

Liskarm:
So what do we do?

Occphen:
They seized pretty much everything from the safehouse.

Rangers:
At least we're all unharmed. That's what really matters.

Rangers:
Come with us, Mr. Occphen. We'll sign you in at the branch office, then contact the landship and figure out what to do.

Occphen:
That's really our only option.

Schwarz:
...I'm not so sure.

Rangers:
What do you mean?

Schwarz:
...That Picale woman... could she be the one behind all this?

Schwarz:
The Lord was so slow to act, even as the mercenaries were rounding up the Infected.

Schwarz:
...And now we've got a captain of the guard, taking everyone away all nice and legally.

Schwarz:
This can't just be a coincidence.

Rangers:
...That does make sense.

Schwarz:
...I'm going to tail them... and see.

Ash:
I'm going too.

Rangers:
No. More hands are more easily seen.

Rangers:
The rest of you stand by.

Schwarz:
......

Rangers:
What's the matter?

Schwarz:
I thought you won't agree with this plan.

Rangers:
Avoiding conflicts with the local Lord doesn't mean our hands are tied here. We need to play to the score.

Rangers:
Some times you need a few tricks to get things working.

Schwarz:
I see...

Picale:
Get them all to shelter first, then I want three with me.

Picale:
I think there's something happening in the mines.

Lord's Guard:
Understood.

Picale:
Is there enough room left in the shelter?

Lord's Guard:
Not really. Half of the town's population is already inside.

Picale:
Tell them to move upstairs if necessary. Them can have my father's room.

Lord's Guard:
Is this...really necessary?

Picale:
I don't see anything wrong with it. My father will do the same should he lived.

Lord's Guard:
...I see.

Picale:
Don't let your guard down anyway.

Picale:
...Wait, did the lights go out as soon as we left?

Lord's Guard:
I don't remember...

Picale:
! !

Picale:
Out of the wayÔºÅ

Lord's Guard:
Aaah!

Originiutant:
Gaa...

Picale:
We're under attack! Protect the civilians!

Picale:
Where did they come from?!

Picale:
What are you waiting for?! Get ready to break through!

Lord's Guard:
There's too many of them!

Picale:
Take the civilians and get out of here! I'm breaking off!

Picale:
Come on, you cowardly bandits!

Picale:
Phew... How many was that?

Picale:
Finally.

Miarow:
Lady Picale!

Picale:
Doctor! What are y ou doing here?!

Miarow:
Don't go! The Lord's Manor has already been...

Picale:
Doctor!

Picale:
......

Picale:
Drudge!

Picale:
Get the hell out of here! I'm going to chop your goddamned head off!

Drudge:
Hahaha... You're loud as you ever were, dear sister.

Picale:
You... You disgusting... I have to kill you.

Drudge:
Show me what you've got.
