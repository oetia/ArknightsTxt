Half a month later

Picale:
Thank you for all you've done, Cohen, Kötz, Tina, Alexsandr.

Picale:
On behalf of... The town of Long Spring...

Picale:
Sorry, I'm not so good with this kind of formal language.

Picale:
Thanks to you, I survived the conflict with my brother, and my people were able to return to live on their land.

Picale:
Thank you.

Ash:
We were only doing what had to be done.

Ash:
We started this, so it's our responsibility to end it.

Picale:
If it weren't for my irredeemable brother, none of this would've happened.

Picale:
I would have liked to offer you a reward.

Picale:
But, as you can see, our town has been destroyed.

Picale:
Anything we have left, I want used to rebuild Long Spring.

Picale:
A cash reward... is beyond my power to give you.

Picale:
But anything you may want from this home is yours to take.

Picale:
I think we will have to tear it all down and build a new Long Spring with the survivors.

Ash:
About that.

Ash:
Alexsandr?

Tachanka:
This helmet fits well. Can I keep it?

Frost:
Uh huh.

Blitz:
Really, the nail tips are so blindingly bright, I'd like to put one on my shield so I don't need batteries anymore.

Ash:
That's enough for us. We're satisfied.

Picale:
That's... that's all?

Picale:
My weapons, my father's heirlooms, you can—

Ash:
No thanks. You need them more than we do.

Picale:
......

Picale:
Thank you.

Ash:
Let's go. We should leave now.

Liskarm:
Mister Kötz......

Franka:
You're finally done.

Schwarz:
......

Rangers:
Did you say goodbye to the Lord?

Rangers:
Then it's time for us to go too.

Stormeye:
My team will cover your return to Rhodes Island.

Rangers:
Thank you.

Stormeye:
Miss Cohen, your squad is coming with us, right?

Ash:
Right. We've been fighting too long. We need a place to rest and resupply.

Ash:
And most importantly, we probably need some identities.

Ash:
Identities we can go around the world with... around Terra.

Stormeye:
Sure.

Stormeye:
The car's ready. We're off.

Human Resources Operator:
Your information has been registered with Rhodes Island. You may stay and resupply at Rhodes Island field offices, or safehouses across Terra.

Human Resources Operator:
Although you are not official employees of Rhodes Island, the mission network is open to you and you will be paid for contracts you complete.

Human Resources Operator:
That's about it. Is there anything else you'd like to know?

Blitz:
Just real quick, I have to ask, does Rhodes Island have any sci-fi literature?

Human Resources Operator:
I'm sorry?

Tachanka:
So these are our new identities.

Blitz:
At least I've got a shield I can use. Could be worse.

Frost:
Do we have a plan?

Ash:
Try to take a look at this world, which we now know too little about.

Ash:
I'd like to have a detailed writeup myself.

Ash:
But this time, I'm sorry.

Ash:
It's all up to us.

Blitz:
So where's our first destination?

Ash:
Somewhere called Siesta. Sounds like a pretty good city.

Tachanka:
Then let's get going.

Tachanka:
Until we make it back home, we're on the road.
