Picale:
Away with you!

Picale:
This is endless!

Tachanka:
How many of these *profanity* things did they make?!

Rangers:
Liskarm! Look out behind you!

Originiutant:
Gaa...

Liskarm:
! !

Franka:
Watch out!

Liskarm:
Franka!

Liskarm:
What are you doing?!

Liskarm:
Give me a hand, Miss Lord!

Picale:
Oh, okay!

Franka:
You... run!

Liskarm:
Don't speak!

Franka:
My leg...You... just leave me.

Liskarm:
Cut the bullshit!

Liskarm:
Piggyback, quick!

Picale:
They're coming back!

Tachanka:
Now! Get out of here!

Occphen:
Over here!

Liskarm:
Mr. Occphen! What are you doing here?

Occphen:
How could I just wait around down there? I'm a Rhodes Island Operator too!

Liskarm:
Damn straight! You really saved us!

Rangers:
Get ready to blow the engine...

Rangers:
Three, two, one...

Tachanka:
What's the situation?

Rangers:
They've been pushed back, for now. But they'll come for us again before long.

Frost:
There... seems to be less of them?

Frost:
I'm all out of 'welcome mats.' Ammo's gone too.

Frost:
What's the plan, Alexsandr?

Tachanka:
Get to the shelter.

Frost:
What?

Tachanka:
Get to the shelter! Take the Rhodes Island Operators and get to shelter!

Frost:
What about you?

Tachanka:
I'll cover you.

Frost:
Cover? And who's covering you?

Tachanka:
I don't need cover.

Frost:
Hey! Get it together! Alexsandr!

Tachanka:
I'm all together.

Tachanka:
I'm tired of all the hiding and running.

Tachanka:
Running can't win you the war. History's shown.

Frost:
But this isn't a war.

Tachanka:
It is to me.

Tachanka:
When they pull weapons on the Infected and try to kill my friends, it's a war.

Tachanka:
I've been through plenty of wars in my time.

Tachanka:
If I can kill even one more *profanity* monster here, it'll give the townsfolk a better shot at survival.

Tachanka:
I'll make my stand here until I run out of ammo. Until the very end.

Tachanka:
The battle's not over. How could I retreat?

Frost:
You're the one who says not to play hero!

Tachanka:
I don't think I'm playing hero, Tina.

Tachanka:
I'm just doing the right thing.

Tachanka:
No matter what happens, the show ends here, today.

Frost:
Alexsandr! !

Rangers:
I'm staying too.

Frost:
But why...?

Rangers:
It was always going to turn out like this. We all knew it, from the moment you decided to stay and fight.

Rangers:
I'll stay behind and help the warrior hold them back. And if things go bad, I'll cover his retreat.

Frost:
Mr. Rangers...

Frost:
Alexsandr, take this.

Tachanka:
What's this?

Frost:
An Originium bomb I tried my hand at making. There's only two left.

Tachanka:
...Thanks.

Frost:
Stay alive!

Tachanka:
...No promises.

Tachanka:
You didn't tell her the truth. You're not going to run.

Rangers:
Hahaha... You didn't have to go blowing this old man's scheme.

Rangers:
You need someone to hold these monsters back.

Tachanka:
This is...?

Rangers:
The old Lord's blade. I borrowed it.

Rangers:
This is a fine blade. The old Lord had good taste.

Rangers:
Beautifully decorated steel, and a hand-lain turquoise handle that's as nice as any modern industrially-manufactured weapon.

Rangers:
It's a lot safer to stand in the back with a bow and arrow than fighting on the front line.

Rangers:
I'm so much older and slower than I was.

Tachanka:
But the blade, she's as sharp as ever.

Rangers:
I still don't know your name, warrior.

Tachanka:
Alexsandr Senaviev.

Tachanka:
You can call me Alexsandr.

Rangers:
I should tell you my name too.

Rangers:
But the sands buried my name the day we stained the valley red with blood, along with the past.

Tachanka:
It's fine.

Tachanka:
You decided to stay and fight. That's what matters.

Tachanka:
'Rangers'.

Tachanka:
'They told me I'd died. They were wrong. I was reborn. '

Tachanka:
No matter how many of those monsters there are.

Tachanka:
Let them come.
