Schwarz:
It's still moving!

Blitz:
Bomb deployed! Time to go!

Blitz:
It... looks like it's budding?

Blitz:
What on earth... is it?

Ash:
Whatever it is, it doesn't belong in this world.

Blitz:
We have to evacuate. We need to get out before the bomb goes off.

Schwarz:
This way!

Tachanka:
I'm out of ammo.

Tachanka:
Rangers?

Rangers:
I'm still here...

Tachanka:
You don't look so good.

Rangers:
I'm old, so old... phew...

Tachanka:
What happened to your hand?

Rangers:
I couldn't dodge. That's all.

Tachanka:
What do we do now? Should we go to the shelter?

Rangers:
No news from the mine?

Tachanka:
None.

Rangers:
Hahaha...

Rangers:
I never thought we'd hold out this long... but we're almost to the end of the road.

Rangers:
What are you doing?

Tachanka:
Making a shield. I always wanted to try, actually.

Rangers:
Hahaha...

Rangers:
What a trip down memory lane. Back to the glorious good old days.

Rangers:
The young rangers all gathered at the edge of town.

Rangers:
Knowing the overwhelming odds stacked against them, knowing most would spill their blood in the wasteland after the war.

Rangers:
But they laughed and sang war songs, as if they were facing down bugs to be easily squashed.

Rangers:
War is cruel, and merciless. Some backed down. Many more held the line.

Rangers:
The fallen became legends. The survivors were tasked with remembering them.

Rangers:
And the last one standing in that bloodbath, after all that time, started to feel the fear of death set in.

Tachanka:
Because he doesn't want the dead to be forgotten?

Rangers:
Hahaha... maybe that's why.

Rangers:
It's been an honor to fight alongside you, Alexsandr.

Tachanka:
The honor is mine, Rangers.

Tachanka:
But don't be so gloomy. I haven't given up the fight.

Tachanka:
I'll smash a few to death.

Rangers:
Wait... what's that?

Rangers:
The cavalry's here! Hahahahahaha! We're saved!

Rangers:
This technique... Must be that young person.

Stormeye:
I picked up a Rhodes Island distress signal and figured it was a normal rescue mission.

Stormeye:
I didn't think I'd run into you.

Stormeye:
Old Ranger.

Stormeye:
You're back in business, huh?

Rangers:
Haha, at my age? You're making fun.

Stormeye:
What about your sword, Ranger?

Rangers:
I'm too old. I haven't been able to swing it for years.

Rangers:
If it weren't for you, today would be the end of these old bones.

Stormeye:
You sell yourself short, Old Ranger.

Stormeye:
Listen up, squad. The objective is the Lord's manor.

Stormeye:
The enemy is an extremely dangerous form of Originium organism.

Stormeye:
Keep your location updated.

Rangers:
Be careful. There's many of them. Try not to let your folks fight alone.

Rangers:
Also, be mindful of the ground. They are good at drilling.

Stormeye:
Understood.

Stormeye:
It's an honor to fight beside you.

Stormeye:
'Scimitar of the Bloody Valley'.
