Drudge:
How long has it been, dear sister?

Drudge:
Six months? A year? Longer?

Picale:
Drudge, you attacked the Lord's men and stormed his manor. This is treason!

Drudge:
Treason? Hah. Heh heh.

Drudge:
You have to know, Picale.

Drudge:
If it weren't for that rotting old man's obsession with protecting his infected... oh, distressed assets.

Drudge:
This wouldn't even be your place.

Drudge:
Relax, girl.

Drudge:
Check out these toys from an enthusiastic Columbian donor.

Drudge:
The TSW-2 Ultrasonic Impact Unit, a product of advanced technology. It's experimental, never used in the field before. The only downside is the size.

Drudge:
It was real tough to hide in town. Took a while.

Drudge:
Took me a while to get you out of the mansion too.

Drudge:
So tell me, my dearest little sister, what good are your sick moves now? What good is that iron will of yours?

Picale:
......

Drudge:
And check out my friends here. Sarkaz friends.

Drudge:
They're not your run-of-the-mill braindead devils. They're from Columbia too. They get the job done.

Drudge:
You know what that means?

Drudge:
It means they're here for progress. Progress you and the old man could never understand.

Drudge:
Get your margins high enough and money's more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

Drudge:
Whatever happened to the old man's worthless logic?

Mercenary:
Boss, we found this in a big house.

Drudge:
Give it to me.

Drudge:
Oh, an appointment letter from the Lord Ameer of Bayalir.

Drudge:
Fine grain papyrus, embossed signature, blocky Bayalir writing, and this black seal.

Drudge:
Hmph.

Drudge:
Where's the old man?

Mercenary:
He wasn't there. We searched every room and found plenty of townsfolk, but not the old man you're talking about.

Picale:
Father is dead. I am the Lord of Long Spring now.

Picale:
You have disobeyed your Lord, and in so doing disobeyed the Lord Ameer, and for that your punishment is death!

Drudge:
That's the plan you and the old man came up with?

Drudge:
Hahaha...

Drudge:
Hahahahaha...

Picale:
Grrgh!

Drudge:
This is getting stupid. You really think you can use the Lord Ameer to outmaneuver me? Don't make me laugh.

Drudge:
You're gonna execute me?

Drudge:
The old man's proud Reproba guards are lying headless in an alley somewhere right now.

Drudge:
Those tough guards are gone now, and who's left to stop me?

Picale:
You're a psychotic piece of shit! You grew up with them! They treated you like their own son! I didn't think you were this far gone...

Drudge:
They shouldn't have gotten in my way.

Drudge:
And neither should you.

Drudge:
We're blood, so let me make it a little clearer for you, sis. I wanna be sure you understand.

Drudge:
Yes, you're a Lord of Sargon now. Sure.

Drudge:
But me? I'm a bum, abandoned by my family.

Drudge:
And in a few years, when you meet an unfortunate end, I'll go to the Court of Bayalir.

Drudge:
With my pedigree, plus the resources and wealth to prove my loyalty to the Lord Ameer, do you think he might just hand Long Spring back to me?

Picale:
No!

Drudge:
Why don't I give you another scenario: let's say you die in battle just a short while after taking charge.

Drudge:
Then I hand your corpse over to the Lord Ameer, and get to join the Zhayedan, would that work out better for me?

Picale:
Drudge, you're a disgusting, horrific, disaster of a person!

Drudge:
You're getting excited, sis.

Drudge:
All that's just hypothetical. It's not real. We're having a brother-sister talk here.

Drudge:
Because I know a much better place for you.

Drudge:
See these things with the rocks on them?

Drudge:
If you're so eager to protect the Infected, why not join 'em?

Picale:
Drudge!

Drudge:
Once you die from it, I'll find a nice cave to bury you in.

Drudge:
Then you and the old man can watch me dig out the Originium buried under the mines and turn Long Spring into the mineral heart of Bayalir.

Drudge:
So, what do you think?

Picale:
...You sold out your family, and sold out our land! I curse you, Drudge. May you die a horrible death!

Drudge:
Whatever makes you happy, sis. Curse away. Use that voice while you've still got it.

Drudge:
I guess we're done here.

Drudge:
(Columbian) You, come here.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
(Columbian) What is it, Boss?

Drudge:
(Columbian) Bring the Infected to the egghead.

Miarow:
*cough* *cough*...

Sarkaz Mercenary:
(Columbian) Right. I'm on it.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
(Columbian) What about this kid? Looks like he's on his way out.

Drudge:
(Columbian) Bring him, dead or alive.

Drudge:
(Columbian) As for my sister...

Drudge:
(Columbian) Turn her Infected. You Sarkaz must know how to do it.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
(Columbian) Roger.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
(Columbian) But that isn't in our contract. There'll be an extra fee.

Drudge:
(Columbian) Save it. You know there'll be plenty of money to go around once our work here is done and the mine is up and running.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
What a nice brother you have there.

Picale:
(Closes eyes)

Sarkaz Mercenary:
(Raises weapon)

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Erm...

Mercenary:
We're under attack! Get a shield up, protect the boss!

Mercenary:
Wha?!

Drudge:
What's happening?!

Mercenary:
Boss, we've got company!

Drudge:
I thought you took care of all the guardsmen!

Mercenary:
I saw! I saw! It's...

Mercenary:
Aagh!

Drudge:
Caster, get the monsters moving!

Mercenary Caster:
Wait... I see... It's...

Mercenary:
Hurry!

Mercenary:
Ahhhh! My shoulder! My shoulder!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Don't panic! Where's the enemy?

Mercenary:
I... I don't see them!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Fall back. They've got crossbows. Get to cover!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Cover Drudge! We can't let anything happen to him!

Mercenary:
I saw! It's a Feline!

Mercenary:
Look out! Retreat! Retreat!

Schwarz:
......

Picale:
You... You're with Rhodes Island...

Schwarz:
Can you move, Reproba?

Picale:
Thanks...

Originiutant:
Gaa...

Mercenary Caster:
Okay, it's working.

Mercenary Caster:
This isn't over yet. Hahaha.

Drudge:
Hmph, the old man's toys can only be useful at a time like this.

Drudge:
You, take the monsters and finish them off.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Roger.

Schwarz:
There's too many. I can't guarantee your safe escape.

Picale:
This will do.

Picale:
Where are my weapons?

Schwarz:
What for?

Picale:
It's my fault Drudge turned out like this.

Picale:
I can't face my late father...

Picale:
But I will carve out that traitor's heart and bury it in Long Spring if it's the last thing I do!

Schwarz:
Don't be hasty, there's too many of them. Getting yourself killed won't help the town survive.

Schwarz:
I've sent out the signal. They should be here in a minute.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Boss! Those mercenaries and Rhodes Island are assaulting us.

Drudge:
What are you afraid of? With this mansion tough as iron, I don't believe those mercenaries can cause us any harm.

Drudge:
Tell those casters to finish that Feline with monsters. Others go defend the entrance.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Roger.

Ash:
Report?

Blitz:
They have formed a defensive line with the courtyard walls. I suppose there are snipers and hulky mercenaries hiding behind.

Blitz:
The same way as usual?

Ash:
A wall like this doesn't even bother me.

Ash:
Let's show them who's the real boss here.

Franka:
Now that's a big hole in the wall. I didn't expect a technology like this.

Ash:
Cover fire! Breaching!

Tachanka:
Roger!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Stop them. Now!

Liskarm:
Out of my way!

Blitz:
Not over yet!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Bastards! Where the hell are the snipers?

Rangers:
Snipers? There's no more snipers I'm afraid.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Where did you...

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Ugh...

Ash:
We've breached the out wall. Nicely done, old man.

Rangers:
Don't let your guard down. There's still many of them.

Frost:
Wait... what's that thing they just pushed out?

Franka:
That's...

Liskarm:
Get down!

Franka:
*cough*... Bless my ears...

Liskarm:
Are you okay?

Franka:
Yeah, I'm fine.

Liskarm:
What about the others?

Frost:
All fine. but now I feel everywhere hurts...

Ash:
What is this weapon?

Franka:
How come they even have stuff like this?

Liskarm:
An experimental weapon of Volvort Kochinski... How unexpected.

Rangers:
Now we're in trouble.

Ash:
It's about to fire again. Find cover!

Blitz:
If it hits you, you'll be doomed for sure.

Mercenary:
Boss! They've breached the out wall!

Drudge:
Don't you see they are being suppressed? What are you worried about?

Drudge:
Take care of my sister and that Feline first. Then we'll deal with the rest.

Drudge:
I'm having the edge. Now it's just a matter of killing a few more.

Picale:
Five! These are your monsters, huh? Drudge! Get out and face me!

Picale:
Six! C'mon, You ugly and filthy monsters! I'm gonna smash you all into shreds!

Schwarz:
Calm down, Lady Picale. Save your strength.

Schwarz:
There's... too many of them.

Miarow:
No... *cough*... *cough*...

Miarow:
Lady Picale... Miss Schwarz...

Schwarz:
Doctor!

Miarow:
You... *cough* *cough*... have to get out of here!

Miarow:
Come, monster...

Schwarz:
What are you doing?

Miarow:
(It hurts... so bad.)

Miarow:
(Where am I...? Did I pass out?)

Miarow:
(What is this...?)

Picale:
...You sold out your family, and sold out our land! I curse you, Drudge. May you die a horrible death!

Miarow:
(Lady Picale! She's on the ground?)

Miarow:
(What happened?)

Miarow:
(Oof... ouch...)

Miarow:
*cough* *cough*...

Miarow:
(That's... blood?)

Miarow:
(Oh...)

Miarow:
(Ow... so cold.)

Drudge:
(Columbian) Bring the Infected to the egghead.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
(Columbian) Right. I'm on it.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
(Columbian) What about this kid? Looks like he's on his way out.

Drudge:
(Columbian) Bring him, dead or alive.

Drudge:
(Columbian) As for my sister...

Drudge:
(Columbian) Turn her Infected. You Sarkaz must know how to do it.

Miarow:
(He... What is he doing to the Infected?)

Miarow:
(I can't stand up...)

Miarow:
(Who is that...?)

Miarow:
(It's Miss Schwarz...)

Miarow:
(Alone...)

Miarow:
(I have to help her...)

Miarow:
(Hah... It all comes down to this, in the end.)

Miarow:
You... run...

Schwarz:
What are you doing?!

Miarow:
Leave me alone! Get out of here!

Schwarz:
Is that a refined Originium Ingot?

Schwarz:
Why do you...?

Schwarz:
! !

Miarow:
I haven't used... Arts... in so long.

Miarow:
(There's so much I still want to do.)

Miarow:
(I don't want to die yet...)

Miarow:
(A doctor should be saving lives. I have to... save...)

Mercenary Caster:
My eyes! My eyes! Ahhhh!!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Get up! Hold the line!

Drudge:
*cough* *cough*... *cough*.

Drudge:
What happened... what was that?

Mercenary:
The Originiutants! They're out of control!

Drudge:
How?

Drudge:
Where's the Ultrasonic Emitter?

Mercenary:
The little twerp fried it!

Mercenary:
We've completely lost control! What do we do?!

Mercenary:
Gaaaagh!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
The Feline's back.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Get a shield up, protect the boss!

Picale:
Drudge!

Picale:
Your life is forfeit!

Drudge:
Again with the nagging!

Drudge:
I want their heads on a platter now!

Drudge:
What is it this time?!

Liskarm:
Target located. At my position.

Ash:
We're getting them out of there. Open fire!
