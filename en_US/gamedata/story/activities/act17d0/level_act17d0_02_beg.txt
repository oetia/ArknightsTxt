Ash:
Mission log day 184.

Ash:
Currently, we are still holding fast in this run-down house.

Ash:
The 184th day of the mission and the 27th day of reaching the aforementioned run-down house.

Ash:
Who would believe that we've already lived in this place for 184 days.

Ash:
We still have no clues about this world.

Ash:
Two weeks ago, based on instructions from the locals, we left this run-down house and headed to another town.

Ash:
Before we left, the townspeople said that it was a 'more developed place.' I am unsure if our definitions of developed are the same.

Ash:
What happened? Turns out it was a bandit den.

Ash:
No batteries, no useful information, not even a single person we could communicate normally with.

Ash:
Of course, we didn't leave empty-handed. Tina 'acquired' a car.

Ash:
The process was long and arduous, and used up much of what little supplies and ammunition we still had.

Ash:
However, the car was heavily damaged during the conflict, and broke down soon after we returned to the house.

Ash:
Alexsandr tried to repair the car, but this car didn't have an obvious fuel intake point, and on further inspection even the fuel tank was absent.

Ash:
The engine's structure was completely incomprehensible to him, to the point he wasn't even sure if it was actually an engine.

Ash:
The only good news was that it was a left-hand drive car.

Ash:
Having been in this world for half a year by now, we are very certain that this place is not Earth.

Ash:
Stealing cars and getting into gunfights, it's like we're fugitives in a post-apocalyptic film.

Ash:
Those bandits with long lizard tails didn't even need to use guns, as they were able to throw javelins weighing up to 10 kilograms to a distance tens of meters away. The term gunfight may not be accurate here.

Ash:
Some of them could even create huge fireballs from thin air and launch them, with the effect somewhere in between a grenade and an RPG.

Ash:
This world is far too abnormal, to the point where I'm no longer surprised by anything.

Ash:
The adaptability of humans often exceeds my expectations. It seems that we will continue to struggle to survive here.

Ash:
Today will be the last day I'm recording. I don't plan on recording anymore.

Ash:
The storage for this recorder is almost full, and the battery will not last much longer.

Ash:
Our only source of power on this world is Tina's solar charger. Thank goodness this world has a sun as well.

Ash:
What would happen if this charger broke, or if we used up all our supplies and ammunition?

Ash:
To be frank, I don't know.

Ash:
This situation still feels unreal to me, with everything being so weird......yet so natural.

Ash:
Which way is the path back home?

Tachanka:
Come on, Uman, look at this.

Tachanka:
Hey, you don't eat vegetables?

Tachanka:
Let me see what else I have here......

Ash:
What are you doing?

Tachanka:
Haa! Come and look at Uman, my little buddy.

Ash:
You're raising a......what's this called again?

Tachanka:
Originium slug, that's what the locals call these things.

Ash:
......

Ash:
You still have the mood to raise this?

Tachanka:
Why not? I'm spending all day sitting on the roof after all, might as well find something to do. Can't be talking to my machine gun all the time.

Ash:
Your job is to keep aware of the surrounding area's safety, not play around with this snail thing.

Tachanka:
What you've said makes sense, but what are we guarding against? Those quivering Infected, or the townsfolk living a kilometer away who never come here anyway?

Tachanka:
The only living thing that's come close to this dump of a house is a flying lizard, which I suppose helped out with the ration issue.

Ash:
......Where's Tina and Kötz?

Tachanka:
They went to exchange supplies with those Infected people.

Tachanka:
Tina managed to hunt some stuff again yesterday. She's becoming pretty experienced at it.

Ash:
Tina went out to hunt by herself again?

Tachanka:
Of course, she's even enjoying it. She's been trying to capture a wild burdenbeast.

Tachanka:
By the way, Kötz went to the town.

Tachanka:
Remember that thing I dismantled from the car? Kötz said he knows a mechanic in town and wanted to ask about it.

Ash:
Fine.

Tachanka:
You're too anxious, Cohen.

Tachanka:
Just relax, we can't return anytime soon anyway.

Tachanka:
Learn from Kötz and go talk with those people. They're somewhat friendly, at least.

Tachanka:
I still haven't learned the local language. Man, Kötz really knows his stuff.

Ash:
That's what I'm afraid of.

Tachanka:
Afraid of what?

Ash:
Kötz is getting too close to those people. It isn't a good thing, the atmosphere around here is very abnormal.

Ash:
That town is too full of contradictions. We've been here for nearly a month, don't tell me you haven't picked up on that.

Ash:
A local government official who stays in his manor all day and never leaves......Oh, I guess the proper term is 'lord'? There's those fully-armed private soldiers of his as well.

Ash:
And this 'infected zone'.

Ash:
The entire region is governed by the same lord, yet these Infected are not allowed to live in the town. Even the other townsfolk are unwilling to approach this place.

Ash:
They were driven here.

Tachanka:
That's because these friends 'got a strange sickness'.

Tachanka:
The act of separating the sick when an infectious disease is raging about is not uncommon after all, even in the past. At least the lord did not just lock them all up in prison.

Ash:
Originium sickness......or was it Oripathy? I don't remember the exact term.

Ash:
All we know about this sickness is that it is related to Originium, it is infectious and it is incurable.

Ash:
But how does it actually spread between people? What does it being incurable actually mean?

Ash:
No one's answered our questions, and assume that we should know the basic situation.

Ash:
This disease is either common sense in this town, or it is common sense in this world.

Ash:
If it is only contact with Originium ore that will cause problems, then I don't think that it is necessary to carry out quarantine measures.

Ash:
Besides, the doctor also thinks that there is no risk of infection from our frequency and distance of interaction with these Infected.

Ash:
This infected zone is just a wall-less prison, breeding hate between the Infected and the townsfolk. You can feel it even without seeing it for yourself.

Ash:
The word I'm using is 'hate', not just exclusion and discrimination. Hate is carved into every word they speak, every action they do. It's become part of their culture.

Ash:
Hate. You understand what I mean? This isn't just a problem about an unknown disease anymore. We shouldn't get involved in any local conflicts.

Ash:
Just imagine this scenario. If the townsfolk began grabbing torches, raising pitchforks and rushing into these Infected's homes, what would you do then? Shoot them down?

Tachanka:
Hard to say.

Tachanka:
We have them to thank for our food, water and medicine for the past few months.

Tachanka:
Before this, we've been trudging back and forth across this treacherous wasteland, being attacked by anything that moves and not getting even a single glimpse of civilization......until we got their help.

Tachanka:
Do you really think we can just 'mind our own business', Cohen?

Tachanka:
If they grabbed weapons and broke into Doctor Miarow's clinic, do you really want to just stand aside and watch?

Ash:
......

Tachanka:
As for the problem you mentioned earlier, I don't think the infectiousness can be ignored.

Tachanka:
It's as if everyone in this world has undergone professional chemical warfare training. They are always covering up their nose and mouth, and being extremely sensitive about protecting their respiratory systems, no matter their age or gender.

Tachanka:
I've repeated this point before as well, that we must prepare similar protections for ourselves......

Tachanka:
The doctor also approved of us keeping our distance. Thankfully the Infected don't have any complaints towards this. Perhaps this is normal to them.

Ash:
What did the doctor say about this?

Tachanka:
I didn't ask him. None of us asked him.

Tachanka:
Every time we mention this topic, he always looks as though he would rather avoid it completely. As long as he thinks our defensive measures are fine, I won't bother him about it.

Ash:
(Shhh...)

Ash:
......

Ash:
'I did not order pizza.'

???:
There's no need to match passwords, Miss Cohen.

???:
It's me, Miarow.

Tachanka:
Right on cue.

Ash:
Hold on, let me open the door.

Ash:
Good morning, doctor.

Miarow:
Good morning, Miss Cohen.

Miarow:
Good morning, Mister Alexsandr.

Tachanka:
Heh, we were just talking about you.

Miarow:
You do realize you're raising an Originium Slug, Mister Alexsandr?

Tachanka:
Yeah, this little thing is actually pretty fun to play with. Tina caught some earlier and this one was too small, so I kept it.

Tachanka:
So you came to look for Tina?

Miarow:
No, I'm here to deliver stuff.

Miarow:
These are medical supplies, there were more leftovers this time.

Ash:
Thank you very much, doctor. We're always imposing on you.

Miarow:
I should be the one thanking you. It's all thanks to those Originium Slugs Miss Tina caught that we have enough painkillers for the next few months.

Tachanka:
So, these 'Originium Slugs' really can cure diseases?

Miarow:
How do I put it...

Miarow:
Oripathy is incurable......This remedy made by fermenting the body fluids of Originium Slugs can only help to relieve the pain, it cannot actually cure the disease.

Miarow:
However, being able to relieve the pain is already a great blessing to the Infected. Crystallization on the skin will affect normal life, and the pain is so unbearable for some that they cannot even move.

Ash:
It's great that we can be of help.

Miarow:
This is the book that you asked me to look for you last time. I specifically looked for one in the Ursus language.

Tachanka:
Oh, great. Let me take a look.

Tachanka:
Right......

Tachanka:
......Hmm......

Ash:
Can you understand it?

Tachanka:
......With some difficulty.

Tachanka:
At a glance, it looks like Cyrillic.

Tachanka:
But when I look closer at it, there are many differences.

Ash:
At least you have something to do now, just treat it as learning a foreign language.

Ash:
It should be more interesting than playing with a snail.

Tachanka:
Speaking of language, what do you call the language we're speaking now?

Miarow:
Your accents are a little weird......

Miarow:
But it is undoubtedly the Victorian language.

Ash:
Victoria......

Tachanka:
What about the locals, what do they speak?

Miarow:
The people here speak Sargonian, though Sargonian itself has a lot of dialects.

Miarow:
For example, most Sargons can't understand the Sargonian spoken by the tribes from the rainforest in east Sargon.

Ash:
That's complicated.

Tachanka:
Ursus.......Ursus.

Tachanka:
What kind of place is Ursus?

Miarow:
Right......

Miarow:
I'm not too sure myself......

Miarow:
Back in school, they used to say that Ursus was in the far north and covered in snow year-round. It's ruled by a Tsar.

Miarow:
But I don't know anyone who's ever been to Ursus, haha.

Tachanka:
Tsar? ...Tch.

Ash:
What's wrong, you seem disappointed.

Tachanka:
A little.

Tachanka:
If I have the chance, I'd really like to take a look at this place called Ursus.

Miarow:
Travelling to faraway places......that sounds nice.

Miarow:
Perhaps only great people like you are able to do it.

Miarow:
If possible, I also hope to travel to Columbia to complete my studies and become a real doctor.

Miarow:
Alas, I don't have that much money, and the patients here still need me.

Ash:
You're still young, there's always a chance in the future.

Miarow:
......

Miarow:
......Maybe.

Miarow:
Oh right, there's one other thing.

Miarow:
Please don't go outside for a while, and hide that car of yours as well.

Ash:
What happened?

Tachanka:
Did something happen in town?

Miarow:
Yes......

Ash:
How did you know?

Tachanka:
Last night, I saw the lord's soldiers patrolling by the wall. That was unusual.

Miarow:
Actually, the lord's soldiers have been doing night patrols in the infected zone for a week now......

Miarow:
Recently, monsters have been appearing in town. They've attacked many people.

Ash:
Monsters?

Tachanka:
Man, all the animals in this world are already so strange, I don't dare imagine what a monster would be like.

Miarow:
The townsfolk have been complaining about the Infected lately. Do you want to move to the second floor of my clinic for a few days? The lord's soldiers will come to inspect this ruined house sooner or later.

Ash:
Will it be fine, doctor? It might bring you trouble.

Miarow:
You've helped me out so much, I don't think it's a big deal.

Tachanka:
I agree with the doctor. Clashing with the lord's soldiers will just get us involved in the local issues and bring more trouble upon us.

Tachanka:
I don't want to get into a fight with those two-meter tall dog-head people.

Miarow:
......Dog......what?

Tachanka:
(Cough) Err, I'll tell you about that next time.

Ash:
Someone's coming.

Tachanka:
'I did not order pizza.'

Frost:
Alexsandr! Open the door!

Tachanka:
It's Tina.

Ash:
Hold on.

Ash:
Calm down, what happened?

Frost:
Cohen! Trouble.

Frost:
A group of armed townsfolk are blocking the road to the infected zone, and the Infected are confronting them.

Frost:
Those people are acting very aggressively, demanding that someone be handed over to them.

Tachanka:
You see, what did I say earlier?

Ash:
......Speak of the devil......

Miarow:
Townsfolk? Armed?

Miarow:
Why? The lord's soldiers do not allow normal townsfolk to approach the infected zone.

Tachanka:
That just means the lord's soldiers no longer have the time to care about this place anymore.

Ash:
Wait! What about Kötz? Didn't Kötz go to the town this morning?

Frost:
Kötz said he was going to look for a mechanic in town this morning, but he hasn't returned yet.

Ash:
Oh no.

Frost:
What do we do?

Ash:
Go check it out first. At least make sure if Kötz is there.

Tachanka:
Should we bring weapons?

Ash:
......Bring them just in case, but don't attack unless absolutely necessary.

Tachanka:
Alright.

Miarow:
No! Wait.

Miarow:
Don't worry, let me handle it first. I'm more familiar with the townsfolk, let me negotiate with them.

Ash:
......Alright, doctor. Please be careful.

Miarow:
It's fine, the townsfolk......They're reasonable.

Townsfolk:
Hand that person over!

Townsfolk:
Give us that suspicious person! All of us saw it!

Infected Townsfolk:
What the hell are you talking about!

Townsfolk:
Don't lie to us, you damn pollutants! I know all the recent happenings were you guys' doings!

Townsfolk:
You ungrateful maggots, the lord should never have allowed you to stay! !

Townsfolk:
I saw a large and heavily wrapped up person leave town and sneak over here earlier! Hand him over!

Infected Townsfolk:
I don't know what you're talking about!

Townsfolk:
Fine, since you refuse to give up this false pretense, we don't need to be courteous anymore.

Townsfolk:
Everyone! Get them!

Infected Townsfolk:
Don't you dare! Do you really think we're pushovers!

Infected Townsfolk:
Everyone! They want a fight!

Blitz:
Hey, stop! Don't fight! Let's talk first, alright?

Infected Townsfolk:
Wah! Mister Kötz, didn't I ask you to hide......

Blitz:
It's fine, don't worry. Let me talk with them.

Townsfolk:
This accent, you're not from here!

Townsfolk:
Who are you!

Blitz:
(Sigh......What do I do now. )

Blitz:
Ahem.

Blitz:
Blitz: I'm a merchant, one that collects trash.

Townsfolk:
Merchant? If you're a merchant, why do you have to sneak around?

Townsfolk:
What do you have under that bulging robe of yours? Come on, show us!

Townsfolk:
Capture him! Bring him to the lord!

Blitz:
Fine fine fine, I'll listen to you. I'll go with you guys.

Blitz:
There's no reason for us to fight, right? I'll explain clearly to your 'lord'.

Infected Townsfolk:
Mister Kötz......

Townsfolk:
Capture these guys as well. I suspect they're all accomplices!

Infected Townsfolk:
You! Don't go too far! What right do you have to capture others!

Blitz:
Oh, come on.

Blitz:
Bro, that's pretty unreasonable of you.

Blitz:
These friends just bought some Originium Slugs that I hunted. Surely it's not a crime to sell Originium Slugs?

Townsfolk:
Who knows if you people are colluding together to plan something sinister.

Townsfolk:
Capture them......capture all of them!

Miarow:
Stop! Are you all planning to go against Lord Tulla's will!

Infected Townsfolk:
Doctor! You've finally come!

Blitz:
Ah......apologies, Doctor Miarow.

Miarow:
Lord Tulla ruled that no one is allowed to approach this zone, unless you are an Infected as well.

Miarow:
What, are all of you Infected?

Burly Townsfolk:
Don't bother trying to smooth-talk us. What kind of relationship do you have with this outsider? Spit it out!

Burly Townsfolk:
Otherwise, we'll capture you as well.

Miarow:
He's a patient of mine. There's no rule that my clinic cannot accept outsiders as patients.

Burly Townsfolk:
Well then, since you want to stop me, why don't you try and see?

Miarow:
......What are you planning to do?

Strange Townsfolk:
Don't waste time here, bring them away.

Miarow:
......

Miarow:
......Hold on!

Miarow:
You......you're not from this town!

Tachanka:
What do you think of it?

Frost:
The doctor is trying to reason with them, but the other side are stubborn as bulls.

Tachanka:
Doesn't seem like it can be resolved peacefully.

Ash:
Don't be rash, let the doctor handle it.

Frost:
......

Frost:
Cohen, something's wrong.

Ash:
Huh?

Frost:
Do you see those big guys at the back there?

Ash:
I see them.

Ash:
......

Ash:
What are those things they're carrying? They're wrapped in cloth.

Ash:
With that size, it doesn't seem like they're farming tools.

Frost:
Would normal farmers carry these kinds of heavy weapons?

Tachanka:
......Even in this world, I don't think farmers would till the fields while carrying huge swords.

Tachanka:
They're not here to talk, Cohen.

Ash:
Don't do anything stupid!

Ash:
......Both of you cover me.

Tachanka:
Understood.

Strange Townsfolk:
Brat, shut your mouth if you don't want to die.

Miarow:
You're not from here.

Miarow:
I've never seen you before. Who are you people!

Miarow:
What are you planning to do here!

Infected Townsfolk:
Huh, you guys are just like thieves crying 'stop thief'!

Infected Townsfolk:
Guards! There are intruders here! Guards!

Infected Townsfolk:
Everyone! There are intruders!

Strange Townsfolk:
Tch.

Strange Townsfolk:
You talk too much.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Time to shut up.

Miarow:
Huh...?!

Blitz:
Doctor, get down!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Guns!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
They're mercenaries!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Why are there mercenaries in the infected zone?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Don't worry about it. We have to bring them all back, dead or alive.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Do it.

Ash:
Don't even think about it!

Ash:
Lord! Cover fire!

Tachanka:
Should have done so from the start.

Tachanka:
Taste this (Russian profanity)!
