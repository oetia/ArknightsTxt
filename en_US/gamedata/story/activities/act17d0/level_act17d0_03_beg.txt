Drudge:
Guns? Mercenaries?

Drudge:
What are you babbling about?

Mercenary:
I'm telling the truth, Boss! They've got huge guns! They killed Jarman!

Drudge:
Mercenaries with big guns? Are they Sankta?

Drudge:
Are you telling me you blew your mission over four Sankta?

Mercenary:
...Erm...

Mercenary:
I don't think they're Sankta... probably...?

Drudge:
They're not Sankta but they're mercs carrying around big guns?

Drudge:
If you're gonna lie to me, at least make it believable.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
He's telling the truth.

Drudge:
What do you mean he's telling the truth?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
He's telling the truth. They were heavily armed, but they really weren't Sankta.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Jarman took one in the brain, but I didn't see an arrow or a bolt. Sarkaz aren't that weak.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
These ones weren't part of your plan.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Having to deal with a bunch of fully armed mercenaries was not in the contract, boss, we need a raise.

Drudge:
And where are they now?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
They're not in the Infected quarter anymore. Our men are looking for them, but we haven't seen any major movements. They should still be in the area.

Drudge:
......

Drudge:
How's the old bastard doing?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Your father's people are tough. Especially that little sister of yours.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
We bumped off some of their fighters, but we haven't been able to breach the manor perimeter.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Your scientist's monsters are doing good work out there, but your casters suck. We lost a lot of them already, without getting much for them.

Drudge:
Those are already the best money can buy.

Drudge:
Until your boss is willing to send us a caster, you're in no position to complain.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Then get your scientist to cook up some more monsters.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Or change tactics. That mansion is a fortress, and a direct attack isn't going to work. And it's not like your sister is an easy target either.

Drudge:
What about the old bastard himself? Is he still holed up in the house?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I haven't seen your father yet. No sign of him at all since we showed up.

Drudge:
Hahaha... I knew it.

Drudge:
I knew something happened to him!

Drudge:
Keep watching the manor. Tell me as soon as you've got news.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
What about the 'change our tactics' part? You're getting ahead of yourself.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Call it a Sarkaz mercenary's intuition. The longer you drag things out, the more chances they have to go wrong.

Drudge:
I have a contingency plan. I just need time to put it together.

Levi:
Confident as I am in the results of my experiments, the look on your face tells me you don't share my assessment.

Levi:
Come, tell me, where have things gone wrong this time?

Drudge:
I need progress from you.

Levi:
Would you like to offer something a little more constructive? Or is your pointless needling all you have?

Drudge:
I gave you enough corpses. I need at least twenty monsters.

Levi:
Originiutants.

Drudge:
What?

Levi:
These 'monsters' are Originiutants. They have a name.

Drudge:
Mutants, Originiutants, why should I care what they're called?

Drudge:
Give me more monsters.

Levi:
I gave you so many already. Did you get them all killed so quickly?

Levi:
I'm curious... How are your minions using the Originiutants? Do they rely on your 'Originium Arts'?

Levi:
What is it exactly? Super powers? Occult mysticism? Magic? Where does it come from?

Levi:
Come, satisfy my curiosity. I must speak with your 'casters'.

Drudge:
Just do your job, egghead.

Drudge:
You don't need to be thinking about Originium Arts right now.

Drudge:
Once we're done here, you'll have plenty of time for your own research.

Levi:
(Russian) I have very little confidence in your project.

Levi:
But speaking of time, did I not tell you? Yours is, in fact, limited.

Drudge:
What are you talking about?

Levi:
The lifespan of these Originiutants won't exceed one week. Whatever it is you have to do, you'll have to do it quickly.

Drudge:
What are you trying to pull?!

Levi:
This is the price for your lack of patience.

Levi:
You want the Originiutants produced quickly, you want them tremendously powerful, and at the same time you want them to have no weaknesses?

Levi:
Do you truly believe such a thing is possible?

Drudge:
......

Drudge:
I told you. No tricks, egghead.

Levi:
I'm busy. I have no time to joke with you.

Levi:
If you are so dissatisfied with my work, I suggest you take matters into your own hands. Use your own ingenuity to solve these genetic engineering complications that I, as a professional, can't solve in so little time.

Levi:
Of course, you could bring me more materials, give me more time, and make your own contributions to this vapid family drama you're putting on.

Levi:
Science is fair. You always have a choice.

Drudge:
That's enough of your slippery talking.

Drudge:
Get back to work, egghead. Don't expect any mercy out of me if you fail.

Drudge:
The price of failure is a slow and miserable death. I'm a man of my word.

Levi:
Hah hah hah. When you put it like that, what else can I say?

Levi:
Good luck, my friend.

Liskarm:
There's so much smoke and chaos. Don't even need to get close to know what's going on.

Franka:
Never expected a riot of this scale here...

Liskarm:
Butting our horns in is sure to cause problems.

Schwarz:
...I'm back.

Rangers:
Oh? What's the situation?

Schwarz:
...It's out of control. There's constant fighting around a mansion on the north side of town. Looks like mercenaries on one side.

Schwarz:
Things are even worse outside the manor. Bloodstains and collapsing houses everywhere.

Schwarz:
There's infected sand beasts scurrying through the alleyways, and there's a lot of them.

Liskarm:
If it's gotten that bad, where's the Sargon military? The Lord Ameer's forces?

Schwarz:
There are some armed guards in that manor on the north side, but I didn't see any other Sargon soldiers.

Franka:
So it's been like this for two days? Then I wonder if the watchman at the safehouse is okay...

Liskarm:
It doesn't look good.

Rangers:
Let's not jump to conclusions.

Schwarz:
...In other news, I found the safehouse.

Schwarz:
Some people have taken up guarding it, but they're not Rhodes Island personnel.

Rangers:
It's been occupied by the mercenaries?

Schwarz:
No... not exactly. They don't look like typical mercs.

Schwarz:
Their defensive positioning is extremely specialized. They have ambush killzones, traps, and decoys all set up.

Schwarz:
Most importantly, they've got a lot of townsfolk in that safehouse.

Liskarm:
Townsfolk? Just what kind of people do they have guarding the safehouse?

Schwarz:
They look pretty much like you. They've got guns.

Liskarm:
Guns? Blacksteel mercenaries?

Schwarz:
They don't have any obvious markings on them. I can't say for sure they're Blacksteel.

Franka:
Armed professionals stripped of any identifying markings... with guns.

Franka:
Oof... my head hurts.

Rangers:
There are a lot of forces at work in this town.

Rangers:
We can rule out a bandit raid.

Rangers:
And if the Lord Ameer's forces are missing, it's not an act of war.

Rangers:
The situation here... Far more complicated than I thought.

Liskarm:
If they're willing to protect civilians in the middle of a riot, they can't exactly be evil.

Franka:
Maybe we should try to make contact?

Rangers:
Let's be careful. There are a lot of possibilities here, even if we just look at them protecting the townsfolk.

Rangers:
I just hope they're the type you can reason with.

Frost:
What's the situation?

Tachanka:
No good. I can't make sense of it.

Tachanka:
This thing looks like a circuit board, but it's totally different from any circuit I've ever seen.

Tachanka:
If you gave me a month and a technical manual, I'm still not sure I could figure it out.

Tachanka:
Screw it. I'm going to stand guard upstairs. I've been squatting so long my back is sore.

Frost:
Good hustle, Lord.

Ash:
No good?

Frost:
None of us have ever seen anything like the tech inside this comms equipment.

Frost:
I don't think we're going to be able to get it working.

Ash:
You wouldn't know it from the outside. It looks like your typical transmitter.

Frost:
Just like with the van back there, the energy they use in this world is unique. All their technology is based on this stuff called Originium.

Occphen:
You're still studying that communicator, huh?

Occphen:
Originium comms equipment uses some really complicated tech. Rhodes Island always had to send engineering casters out to maintain it. I'm not surprised you can't fix it.

Ash:
You said before you used this device to send out a distress signal?

Occphen:
Oh... I'm not sure if the signal actually got through.

Occphen:
When the rioters attacked the safehouse, I hit the communicator as quick as I could. But they broke in before I got to talk to anyone.

Occphen:
Everything happened so fast, I could barely speak... It could be the Rhodes Island operator who took the call couldn't even hear me.

Ash:
So the cavalry isn't coming.

Blitz:
I was never waiting for the cavalry.

Occphen:
You don't look worried at all.

Ash:
You could say we're pretty used to fighting without backup.

Occphen:
Wow. I'm thinking if you had shown up just a little later, I'd be spending the rest of my life in a wheelchair.

Occphen:
Or maybe a coffin.

Occphen:
All I can say is thanks.

Ash:
Not necessary. You've done a lot to help the civilians yourself.

Occphen:
Well, I wouldn't make a big deal out of that. Treating the Infected is kind of Rhodes Island's business. Hahaha...

Occphen:
...Even if I'm just a reserve Logistics Operator serving as a doorman.

Ash:
Treating...? Does that mean there's medical supplies here?

Ash:
But what are these weapons for?

Occphen:
Oh, well...

Occphen:
Rhodes Island is mainly a pharmaceutical company, but this safehouse doesn't actually offer any treatment services.

Occphen:
Safehouses are mostly to provide combat operators with supplies, equipment, weapons and stuff when they're out on missions.

Frost:
Right......

Frost:
Hold on. What's this?

Blitz:
Is this a grenade launcher?

Ash:
Grenade?

Ash:
Let me see.

Blitz:
Oh, my. Is this a landmine?

Blitz:
And you've got all kinds.

Ash:
...I thought the people here didn't use thermal weapons.

Ash:
The structure of this grenade launcher is a little strange.

Blitz:
There's no propellant charge for the grenades. Does it use compressed gas?

Ash:
Look, here's a model using hydraulic springs.

Occphen:
Be careful! That box is full of Originium explosives! It's dangerous.

Ash:
Mr. Occphen, do you have ammunition for small arms here?

Occphen:
Small arms...? Do you mean guns? Oh, are you asking about etched ammo?

Occphen:
We wouldn't usually have anything that valuable in a safehouse like this. Rhodes Island combat personnel rarely use guns.

Ash:
Can we use these explosives?

Occphen:
...*Sigh*...

Occphen:
Just be careful. Originium explosives are very dangerous.

Occphen:
They used to only be for combat operators.

Occphen:
But you look like you know what you're doing. I won't stop you.

Ash:
Thank you very much.

Blitz:
What about these? What are these wild looking parts for?

Occphen:
Backup casting units. Don't break them.

Ash:
Casting units...?

Blitz:
Must be for that 'Originium Arts' stuff.

Ash:
Originium Arts is the technique that lets them throw those fireballs?

Occphen:
We're getting into the weeds here. I'm no caster.

Occphen:
But Originium Arts comes in all kinds of flavors. Every caster has his own specialty.

Ash:
Would the engineering casters you mentioned before be one of those?

Occphen:
Huh? Have you never seen Arts before?

Frost:
Well... we haven't seen much.

Occphen:
But how? You've got guns. Aren't you casters?

Occphen:
A gun user who can't use Originium Arts? Now that's rare.

Miarow:
Oh, Mr. Occphen, your leg hasn't healed yet. I don't want you walking around.

Occphen:
I'm fine, I've got my crutches. I can walk a few steps.

Ash:
Doctor, how are the patients doing down there?

Miarow:
I've got most of the wounded stabilized, thanks to the medical supplies here.

Ash:
You don't look so hot. Are you okay?

Miarow:
I just haven't slept at all. I'll be fine.

Ash:
You need rest. We'll be in big trouble if we lose our only doctor.

Miarow:
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

Blitz:
Speaking of Originium Arts.

Blitz:
Don't they have some kind of magic where you say a spooky incantation and there's a big flash of light and... PRESTO! You're all healed up?

Miarow:
Erm...

Miarow:
What are you talking about? Hahaha...

Blitz:
No, then? What about like a healing potion that you drink it and all your wounds close right up? None of that either?

Occphen:
That's the stuff of sci-fi novels.

Miarow:
There are Arts that can heal wounds, but they're a very difficult type of Arts to master.

Miarow:
Before you can master healing Arts, you first have to have a complete understanding of medical science, you have to know the anatomical structures of all the different races, things like that...

Miarow:
Also, most healing Arts users can only stop bleeding or speed up wound recovery.

Miarow:
These Arts are very useful on the operating table, but in my experience they're no substitute for real medical skill.

Occphen:
Doctor, can you use Arts?

Miarow:
I have a little knowledge... not very useful though.

Blitz:
That's boringly realistic... *sigh*.

Blitz:
To think a world with magic could be so inconvenient.

Blitz:
Hold up, did you just say 'sci-fi novels'?

Blitz:
Now I'm extra curious what your world's sci-fi novels talk about.

Blitz:
Would we find a bookstore in a bigger city? Maybe some history books too? Are books expensive?

Blitz:
I've gotten myself all worked up now.

Occphen:
You're a weird bunch.

Occphen:
Where are you from anyway? Columbia? Victoria?

Occphen:
You talk like you're Victorians, but like from a couple decades ago...

Blitz:
Well... I'm not really sure how to answer that one.

Miarow:
Miss Cohen and her friends came from very far away. From a place where Oripathy doesn't even exist.

Occphen:
What??

Ash:
...Yeah, that.

Occphen:
A country with no Oripathy? Really?

Occphen:
No Oripathy, no Infected, that means no discrimination? A place with no hatred, where everyone's equal?

Occphen:
Lordy loo. What kind of paradise is that?

Blitz:
......

Frost:
......

Ash:
*Sigh*...

Occphen:
...Alright then. Your faces say it all. Just pretend I never asked...

Ash:
!

Frost:
We're under attack!

Ash:
Sitrep!

Tachanka:
This is just the first wave. They have us surrounded.

Tachanka:
They were probing us with those earlier strikes.

Frost:
We've got more incoming!

Ash:
Your traps?

Frost:
All good!

Ash:
Watch your explosives.

Ash:
Blitz, keep an eye on the left flank. Don't let them get the drop on us.

Blitz:
Understood.

Ash:
Lord, conserve your ammo!

Tachanka:
No problem. Let them come.

Ash:
Watch for surprise attacks!

Ash:
Let's see what they've got.

Tachanka:
Here they come!

Ash:
Hold your fire... let them get a little closer.

Frost:
Nine o'clock!

Frost:
Lord, the enemy's up, dead ahead!

Ash:
Enemy down!

Ash:
These big guys with the horns are tough. Go for headshots!

Frost:
Ash! Over there!

Ash:
?!

Ash:
What is that?!

Ash:
Lord! Be careful!

Tachanka:
(Russian profanity)!

Ash:
Alexsandr!!

Tachanka:
I'm okay!

Tachanka:
Don't worry about me! Hold the line!

Ash:
What on earth is this!

Ash:
Watch out for those mutants! Light cover's no good!!

Rangers:
That's a proper formation. Those four know what they're doing.

Rangers:
Sounds like gunfire... No... Those are more intense shots. That's a big, rapid-fire gun.

Schwarz:
They're surrounded.

Schwarz:
It's the same mercenaries who were attacking the manor.

Liskarm:
Those monsters remind me of what we saw in Lungmen.

Franka:
The 'Host' and the 'Herd.'

Franka:
But they're not really the same.

Rangers:
Mercenaries carrying big guns and mercenaries commanding mysterious monsters...

Rangers:
The situation is changing. And the balance is about to break.

Schwarz:
...What do we do?

Rangers:
Don't hestiate. Prepare for battle.

Rangers:
Those vile beings who drivie this kind of monsters into battles deserve not a single bit of mercy.

Schwarz:
Roger.
