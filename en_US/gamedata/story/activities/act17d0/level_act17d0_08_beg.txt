Ash:
Rangers's map stops here.

Ash:
It's all up to us now.

Blitz:
Who knew this cave would be so big?

Blitz:
It's like the ground beneath the town is completely hollow.

Ash:
Are the explosives okay?

Schwarz:
We've got the strongest batch from the safehouse here.

Ash:
I hope Lord's plan works.

Schwarz:
I'm afraid it won't be that simple. Look there...

Ash:
...I hope it's not what I think it is...

Originiutant Infected:
Gaa...

Blitz:
That's... a person?

Originiutant Infected:
Gaa...

Schwarz:
Whatever it is, it's going to die and that's enough.

Blitz:
I won't be surprised at whatever *profanity* showing up now...

Ash:
Keep moving! Don't get caught up in a fight with them. We don't have time to waste in here!

Blitz:
Understood.

Schwarz:
...Why would Long Spring have a facility like this underneath it?

Blitz:
Cohen... Where are we?

Ash:
I knew it! *profanity*, I knew it!

Blitz:
So this is where most of the lab ended up.

Ash:
Now that I think about it, we were too careless.

Ash:
We've lived in this town for so long and we had no idea at all.

Blitz:
It's that psycho behind all this.

Blitz:
What's that smell...?

Ash:
What else could it be? That's the smell of death.

Schwarz:
......

Ash:
Stay frosty. And close.

Blitz:
What are these?

Blitz:
Cages? So many?

Schwarz:
All corpses... people and beasts together...

Ash:
This is the work of Lev Klitschko, a man both mad and cruel beyond imagination. I never should've tried to take him alive. He should have a bullet in his head.

Blitz:
Your typical madman wouldn't do something this awful.

Schwarz:
Wait.

Schwarz:
...There's someone alive in that cage.

Drudge:
Heh.

Drudge:
Look who's here?

Ash:
......

Blitz:
It's that Drudge character.

Ash:
I'd recognize the *profanity* anywhere.

Drudge:
Oh, it's you. The mercenaries.

Drudge:
I'm so glad to see you.

Drudge:
I know we've had our differences in the past... but let's set them aside for now.

Drudge:
I have a feeling you're looking for that scientist... and I know where he is.

Drudge:
We've got a common enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

Ash:
So brazen I'm sick to my stomach.

Drudge:
That Feline over there, I know you.

Drudge:
Your skills are pretty easily recognizable. And one can hear a lot in the mercenary market in Columbia.

Drudge:
You are a killer, aren't you?

Schwarz:
......

Drudge:
Rhodes Island hired you, meaning even they have quite some dirty work to do.

Drudge:
Compared to others, you must know better how to weigh up the pros and cons. Let's have a talk, shall we?

Schwarz:
Shut up. Or I can help you with that.

Drudge:
Shame. I thought people like you would be more realistic.

Ash:
Open the cage.

Schwarz:
What...?

Ash:
Don't worry about it. Just open the cage.

Schwarz:
......

Schwarz:
Got it.

Drudge:
Good call. We all know the score.

Ash:
Yeah. I sure do.

Drudge:
Hold on, what are you doing?

Drudge:
Agh!!!

Drudge:
Hey! You crazy...

Drudge:
You...

Drudge:
Help me......please......

Drudge:
Please...

Drudge:
......

Drudge:
Please... stop.

Ash:
Hah. You can still talk. Guess I'm not done.

Ash:
And this one's for Dr. Miarow.

Blitz:
Okay, okay, he's had enough.

Ash:
Phew...

Blitz:
You went a little overboard there.

Ash:
What... you feel bad for him?

Blitz:
Man, you almost killed him.

Blitz:
Totally rearranged his face.

Blitz:
Save your strength. We've still got work to do.

Ash:
You're right.

Schwarz:
Pfft.

Ash:
What happened?

Schwarz:
Nothing. I'm just feeling a lot more relaxed.

Ash:
You know what? Me too.

Blitz:
If he's locked up in here, he must be part of Lev's plan.

Ash:
I'm not surprised.

Schwarz:
I don't see anyone here...

Schwarz:
Might be an ambush ahead. Keep cautious.

Levi:
Well well well, look who it is. More visitors to my laboratory?

Levi:
It's been a while, my friends from Team Rainbow.

Levi:
You're just in time.

Levi:
No... you always come at precisely the right time.

Ash:
Tch.

Levi:
Don't bother. It's bulletproof glass.

Levi:
I applaud your decisiveness, squeezing the trigger without hesitation. Don't even wait for an end to our little prologue here.

Levi:
But we have a show to put on. A great opening requires a great audience, and a complete opening dialogue.

Levi:
Today is a day of praise for the great work of the Creator. And that Creator is none other than yours truly.

Ash:
Creator? That's quite a title you've given yourself.

Ash:
You're a *profanity* psycho!

Levi:
Psycho... hah. The mediocre always use this word to describe ideas and concepts they cannot understand.

Levi:
Behold this world!

Levi:
Completely different chemistry... totally inverted laws of physics... the flower of science blooms in exploration and doubt. And the most fertile soil lies in the land of the unknown!

Levi:
And now, I have succeeded.

Levi:
Do you see? Can you feel? The surface appearance is similar, but it all functions on radically different principles!

Levi:
This is the evolution of life. This is the iteration of existence.

Levi:
Originium is the truth of this world. You should accept that. Don't fear it.

Levi:
Welcome to the future.

Ash:
Don't you have even the slightest moral compunction over what you're doing?

Ash:
What does human life even mean to you?

Levi:
Human nature is weak, good and evil are subjective definitions of weakness, and what we call guilt is but one of the myriad cognitive signals produced by the brain.

Levi:
And the science I pursue is never swayed by such flimsy concepts.

Levi:
Don't delude yourselves that even in this world you still bind your minds with these meaningless ideas.

Levi:
Even electronic information technology and nuclear energy were originally designed to help us kill each other more effectively.

Levi:
Would you add a new layer of definition to science? Force everything to fit your fragile spiritual needs?

Levi:
Nonsense.

Levi:
But I forgive you.

Levi:
You don't have to understand. I'll allow you to go on, unknowing. Primitive thinking is a common form of ignorance. It's not your fault, and I forgive you.

Levi:
That's the end of my speech. And in addition to my forgiveness, I also offer you my thanks for waiting so patiently.

Levi:
Now it is time for praise. Give your praise to this entirely new life form.

Levi:
Praise be! Praise be! Praise be!!!

Ash:
No matter what, we absolutely can't let that thing make it to the surface.

Blitz:
You stall it! I'll get the bomb ready!
