Blitz:
Clear!

Ash:
Okay, you're on guard duty!

Ash:
Alexsandr, see if any of the mercs on the ground are alive!

Tachanka:
On it.

Ash:
Tina, get your bandages. Take a headcount and patch up the wounded.

Frost:
Roger!

Tachanka:
No playing dead!!

Mercenary:
Wait, please... lower your gun! I'll tell you anything!

Tachanka:
Kötz, tie him up.

Blitz:
Sure.

Ash:
Where's the doctor? Dr. Miarow!

Schwarz:
Over here!

Miarow:
...*cough*...

Ash:
Tina! Bandages! Hurry!

Tachanka:
Stay with me! Don't close your eyes, boy!

Ash:
Why... what happened?

Liskarm:
When you push yourself to use Originium Arts... it worsens your Originium infection...

Ash:
Rhodes Island doesn't have a countermeasure? Isn't this what you people do?

Liskarm:
Between the blood loss, burns, and acute Oripathy symptoms, even if we were back on the landship...

Miarow:
...*cough*...

Tachanka:
I said stay with me, kid.

Miarow:
......

Tachanka:
...You can do this. Remember how you wanted to travel the world? Picture that Columbia you were dreaming about.

Tachanka:
...Stay with me!

Miarow:
*cough* *cough*...

Miarow:
...*cough*...

Tachanka:
......

Ash:
...Doctor...

Frost:
...He's gone.

Schwarz:
...I'm sorry. I couldn't...

Ash:
No... it's not your fault.

Tachanka:
......

Mercenary:
...No... I had nothing to do with that. It wasn't me!

Tachanka:
(Russian profanity), I'm going to twist your *profanity* head off.

Mercenary:
I just...don't...

Tachanka:
You're done for, (Russian profanity). You're toasted.

Mercenary:
No! Don't hurt me! It wasn't me! No!

Blitz:
Alexsandr! Stop! Calm down!

Liskarm:
Where did that guard captain go? The Lord's daughter?

Schwarz:
She chased someone trying to get away. Rangers went with her, don't worry.

Liskarm:
Wait... the crystals on the doctor's skin... are glowing?

Franka:
Huh?!

Franka:
So soon? How?

Schwarz:
! !

Liskarm:
We've got bigger problems! Find an empty room here!

Ash:
What are you doing?

Franka:
No time to explain! Move!

Liskarm:
We need cloth! Curtains, bedspreads, anything!

Schwarz:
Get the doctor into that little house! Hurry!

Tachanka:
What's happening?

Ash:
What's wrong with the doctor? Why...?

Liskarm:
M-Miss Cohen, please calm down. Franka's dealing with the doctor's—

Ash:
Dealing?

Ash:
Dealing with what?

Liskarm:
You've never seen it before? I'll explain it to you later—

Franka:
Cover the doors and all the windows! No cracks!

Schwarz:
The chimney! Block it! And the vents!

Tachanka:
......

Ash:
What... are they doing?

Blitz:
I'm not sure? What's wrong with... the doctor's corpse?

Tachanka:
Don't look.

Ash:
Why?

Tachanka:
Don't look...

Schwarz:
We're good here!

Franka:
Doors and windows good! Ready.

Ash:
Hey, is that room lighting up? The window's glowing?

Liskarm:
Miss Cohen! Get back!

Liskarm:
Don't watch...

Ash:
What on earth is going on?

Ash:
The doctor...

Ash:
......

Ash:
......

Ash:
Oh...
