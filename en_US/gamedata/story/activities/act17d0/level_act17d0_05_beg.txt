Ash:
You can do it! Lord!

Tachanka:
Hnng... Grrrgh! Gah...!

Ash:
Almost! Just a little more!

Tachanka:
And... Hah!

Tachanka:
It's up!

Ash:
Well done!

Rangers:
Yes... It's very impressive you can pull back this crossbow with your bare hands.

Tachanka:
Phew...

Tachanka:
What a design. You couldn't tell by looking at it that this crossbow has such tensile strength.

Rangers:
It's a pretty ordinary crossbow. Most Sarkaz can lock it barehanded.

Tachanka:
A heavy crossbow with this kind of power... at least than one hundred meters, it won't be that different from a gun. It's just too much work.

Tachanka:
...And I already learned the hard way that bit about our physical differences.

Tachanka:
That zappy girl over there might be no weaker than me.

Rangers:
Are you talking about Liskarm? She's a Vouivre. They're a strong race, for sure.

Tachanka:
Right......

Ash:
Why the sudden interest in these weapons?

Tachanka:
We're expecting a lot of fights soon, so it's time to think about what to do when we run out of ammo.

Tachanka:
Without bullets, my gun might as well be a paperweight.

Tachanka:
I don't think we can take them hand-to-hand when it comes to that. And our training and experience won't be enough either.

Ash:
How much do we have left?

Tachanka:
Not much over here. Not even four hundred rounds.

Ash:
Let me show you something.

Tachanka:
Is this a... bullet?

Ash:
It's a bullet that Rhodes Islander named Liskarm uses. They call it an 'etched bullet,' and it's apparently an extremely expensive commodity.

Tachanka:
Did you take it apart yet?

Tachanka:
What's it made of? What's the propellant?

Ash:
This chunk of crystal.

Tachanka:
Looks like an energy source. Is that a propellant or a warhead?

Rangers:
A Laterano gunsmith once told me that every single etched bullet contains a miniature casting unit that matches up with the structure of a Laterano gun.

Rangers:
That means it's not only the gun, but every etched bullet, is basically a caster's staff. That's why they're so expensive, and why they need such complicated Arts that only Sankta can make much use of them.

Rangers:
Other peoples go with easier ranged weapons.

Tachanka:
So Laterano is the name of the country, Sankta is the name of the race. Laterano people are not necessarily Sankta... Got it.

Tachanka:
But that's real bad news about the bullets.

Tachanka:
Do we have any gun here that doesn't require those 'Originium Arts' to work?

Rangers:
I've never heard about those firearms that don't need Originium Arts.

Tachanka:
(Sigh)...

Ash:
One step at a time. At least everybody can use explosives.

Tachanka:
Where did Kötz go with them?

Ash:
They're in the basement. Still trying to fix the thing that looks like a radio transmitter.

Liskarm:
We can't power the comm casting unit.

Franka:
It's a power problem?

Liskarm:
Maybe... I'll have to see.

Franka:
Okay, you all take a step back. The valedictorian is about to do her stuff.

Liskarm:
...Charging...

Blitz:
Oh! Ooh! Oooh!

Blitz:
Was that Arts? It was pretty cool.

Ash:
It definitely... leaves an impression.

Franka:
Is it working?

Liskarm:
It's on!

Franka:
Great work. That's my walking power supply.

Liskarm:
Don't you have anything better to do than annoy me?

Liskarm:
......Hmm......

Liskarm:
No good. It's still not connecting.

Liskarm:
The crystal electronics unit may be too damaged. Or there may be some damage somewhere else in the circuit we can't see with the naked eye.

Liskarm:
We don't have any equipment for repairing Originium circuits here, so we can't troubleshoot.

Franka:
*Sigh*, sounds pretty hopeless.

Tachanka:
Can ordinary people do these Originium Arts too?

Franka:
Theoretically... almost anyone can learn to do Arts at some level, with enough training.

Franka:
It's just that studying Arts takes time and effort, and that gets tied up pretty close with talent.

Franka:
Lots of people master only the most basic Arts, even after pushing themselves a lot harder than others.

Rangers:
I'm a dumb old man, and I've never learned any Originium Arts.

Ash:
What are you thinking?

Tachanka:
Nothing... Just brainstorming about our situation here... some wild, impractical ideas.

Liskarm:
Oh, right, Mr. Kötz.

Liskarm:
Take a look at this shield here.

Blitz:
What's... what's that on the shield?

Liskarm:
I installed a high-powered spotlight and a universal Originium circuit based on the original design and function of your shield. It should work just like you're used to.

Blitz:
Thanks a bundle!

Blitz:
...Oh... But I can't use 'Originium Arts'.

Franka:
Strictly speaking, a universal Originium circuit is a piece of modern technology that lets people who don't know how to use Arts use it anyway. It is loaded with a few simple Originium Arts.

Liskarm:
Of course, the power supply and equipment maintenance still need to be carried out by a trained caster.

Blitz:
All right, let's see. It's still pretty heavy.

Blitz:
...Turn it on... Hit the switch...

Blitz:
All good. I'll give it a try.

Blitz:
Wow! It really works!

Blitz:
But it'll take some getting used to.

Blitz:
I haven't done a shield charge in six months. I've almost forgotten how to use the thing.

Ash:
How are things looking outside?

Frost:
The last attack was also the last enemy movement. We haven't seen any probing strikes since. I don't think that's a good sign.

Frost:
Especially considering what a well-organized bunch of punks they are, I've got a bad feeling about this.

Rangers:
The calm before the storm.

Frost:
Sure enough.

Ash:
Where's the doctor?

Frost:
Resting. He hasn't slept in days.

Rangers:
Give the kid a break.

Rangers:
He shouldn't have to deal with all this at his age.

Rangers:
And we've got another problem on our hands. We're running out of food.

Ash:
Right. Mr. Occphen told us.

Frost:
What are you thinking?

Ash:
I'm thinking whether or not we should take a trip back to the Infected quarter.

Frost:
I get you.

Rangers:
Oh? You have a plan?

Frost:
We left in a hurry. A lot of the sick people didn't have time to bring their food from home.

Rangers:
True. We have enough hands here. We could send some people out to get supplies.

Ash:
Then let's save our talk here. We should be able to get there before the night falls.
