Ash:
Cease fire! Watch out for civilians!

Tachanka:
They're getting away, Cohen!

Ash:
Don't bother with them, protect the others!

Frost:
Someone come here, there are injured people here.

Blitz:
Let's bring them inside.

Ash:
Doctor! Are you ok?

Miarow:
I'm here! I'm fine!

Infected Townsfolk:
My leg! My leg is broken! My leg! ......

Miarow:
Calm down, your leg is still here, it's just dislocated. Grit your teeth.

Infected Girl:
Mama... Mamaaa...

Miarow:
Has anyone seen Algar's mother?

Wounded Townsfolk:
Help me......please......

Miarow:
We're running out of bandages......

Ash:
Those... (profanity)!

Blitz:
Is there a fire over there?

Ash:
Isn't the town center in that direction?

Tachanka:
Looks like this isn't the only place that was attacked.

Miarow:
Why? Where did the lord's guards go?

Tachanka:
Don't care about those guards or whatever anymore.

Tachanka:
There are sounds of fighting everywhere now, and it's only getting worse. We can't stay here, it's too wide open.

Tachanka:
Let's move those wounded behind this building for now!

Infected Townsfolk:
Monsters! The monsters have come again!

Infected Woman:
Help!

Ash:
This is endless!

Ash:
Alexsandr! Get on the roof and cover us!

Tachanka:
Understood.

Ash:
There's no time, doctor. We need to leave this place.

Miarow:
But, where can we go?

Ash:
Let's go to your clinic.

Miarow:
These Infected......

Ash:
Don't worry too much about it, let's get everyone to go to your clinic first.

Miarow:
......Alright.

Miarow:
Someone lend a hand! He can't walk anymore!

Ash:
Kötz, can you go and check if there's anyone else hiding in these houses? Let's get everyone here to the clinic.

Ash:
Stay safe!

Blitz:
Understood.

Ash:
......

Ash:
......This is really a disaster.

Ash:
Forty plus people......Is everyone here?

Miarow:
Yes......

Miarow:
Everyone we've rescued......is here.

Ash:
How many are we missing?

Miarow:
Quite a number, maybe they went to the other side of the town.

Miarow:
But some old ones......they didn't make it......

Blitz:
Don't beat yourself up, it's not your fault.

Blitz:
These monsters, where are they from? Are they trained beasts?

Miarow:
I don't know......I've never seen anything like them before.

Ash:
When those thugs drew their weapons, these monsters began burrowing out of the ground.

Tachanka:
Who cares where they came from. How can there be so many of them?!

Ash:
How's the surrounding situation?

Tachanka:
A big mess.

Tachanka:
There's sounds of combat from the other side of the town. I don't know what happened there.

Ash:
How much ammo do we have left?

Frost:
Not much, I only have four magazines left. If Alexsandr runs out of ammo then we're in big trouble.

Frost:
Ammo isn't the biggest problem right now. This house isn't going to last much longer.

Frost:
Judging by those monsters' size, if we let even one or two escape, they will definitely smash through this wall and it'll be impossible to stop them then. We need a plan.

Ash:
Doctor, how are the patients doing?

Miarow:
Many of them are wounded, I'm only able to do some simple treatment.

Miarow:
We're lacking bandages and disinfectants.

Frost:
Is there any way to leave the town for now?

Tachanka:
Where would we go after leaving town? While bringing so many with us?

Ash:
Without food and water, going onto the wasteland means certain death.

Ash:
I don't think these monsters will give up on attacking us. If we get to the wastelands, we'll just be in a worse position without any cover or means of hiding ourselves. Besides, we've all witnessed their burrowing abilities......

Miarow:
I know a place......It might be safe.

Miarow:
There's a special building at the south side of town. It might be the safest place in town, barring the lord's residence.

Ash:
Do elaborate.

Miarow:
There was this medical organization called Rhodes Island which rented a piece of land at the edge of town.

Miarow:
Later they hired workers to dig a fair amount of soil and stone and built a very solid house there.

Miarow:
......It could be the strongest building around here? It looks just like a fortress.

Ash:
How do you know that this 'Rhodes Island' would be willing to help us?

Miarow:
There's only one watchman at that building, and I know him. I've purchased some medical supplies from him before.

Tachanka:
There's a lot of soil, most likely they dug out a basement.

Tachanka:
Sounds like a safe house used by mercenaries.

Ash:
Doesn't sound reliable.

Tachanka:
Unless we have a better option, I suggest we take a look.

Tachanka:
Without food nor water, staying in this place is no different than waiting for death.

Miarow:
That building is at the edge of town. We can head over from outside town to avoid being seen by others.

Ash:
......Hmm......

Ash:
Kötz, is your shield still usable?

Blitz:
Half of it. I can use it to bash someone......probably.

Ash:
I need someone to go with me, to help protect the doctor.

Blitz:
I'll go. Worse comes to worst I can always shield the doctor with my body.

Ash:
Don't talk crap.

Ash:
Kötz and I will go with the doctor to check out that 'safe house.' Tina, you stay here with Alexsandr.

Frost:
Understood.

Ash:
Doctor, no matter what happens next, please follow my orders.

Miarow:
Understood.

Ash:
Kötz, protect the doctor well.

Blitz:
I'll keep him safe.

Blitz:
I don't see any lights, is there no one there?

Ash:
Keep your distance. This building's door has been smashed.

Miarow:
Even here......

Blitz:
What are these thugs' goals? To rob and plunder like common bandits?

Occphen:
H......help......

Occphen:
Help! Anyone! Help me!

Occphen:
I......I don't want to die......Damn it......

Miarow:
It's the watchman!

Ash:
Don't move and stay here.

Ash:
I'll go have a look.

Occphen:
......If only I didn't take this job......

Occphen:
I don't want to die here......

Occphen:
Who are you!

Ash:
Don't move, your leg's broken.

Occphen:
M......mercenaries......

Occphen:
Don't kill me! I beg you! Don't kill me! I really don't know where the key is! I'm just a simple watchman!

Occphen:
Please believe me! I really don't know!

Ash:
Calm down! I'm here to help.

Occphen:
You......you're not together with those guys......

Occphen:
Help me! Help me!

Ash:
I! Said! Calm down!

Ash:
Kötz! Bring the doctor!

Miarow:
Mister Occphen, your leg......

Occphen:
You......you're that Infected doctor!

Occphen:
Oh, thank heavens!

Miarow:
Don't worry, let me look at your leg.

Blitz:
Man, this place has been turned upside down.

Ash:
The inside looks a lot smaller than the outside.

Blitz:
Secret doors, hidden rooms and fortified walls. Aren't all safe houses like that?

Ash:
What's this?

Blitz:
Radio equipment? It's completely destroyed though.

Blitz:
Such a large machine, looks very retro. Turns out this world also had communications equipment like this.

Ash:
They even have cars after all, it's not strange for them to have radio.

Ash:
There were other 'broken electronics' back at the run-down house we stayed at before, like the fridge, fans, a kettle......Though none of them actually used electricity.

Ash:
Just like this wireless radio, and that car we got.

Blitz:
All these machines have a device filled with black crystals. I suppose that is the energy source for these devices.

Occphen:
Ouch ouch ouch! Please be gentler, doctor!

Miarow:
Please bear with it!

Miarow:
......Luckily it's not very serious, the bone isn't broken.

Ash:
You're the person in charge of this place?

Occphen:
This is......Rhodes Island's branch office. I'm actually just a simple watchman.

Blitz:
Let me guess, those thugs came here and forced you to open the basement door, but you persisted in your duty and kept playing dumb, which resulted in you getting beaten up and left here to die?

Occphen:
......Something like that.

Occphen:
Wait, how did you know there's a basement?

Blitz:
You've been tricked. We're actually the thugs' backup, here to get you to confess everything.

Occphen:
What? ?

Ash:
Kötz!

Blitz:
Don't get angry, I'm just trying to liven up the atmosphere.

Occphen:
You......What are you actually planning to do?

Miarow:
Don't worry, they're good people. They've been protecting the inhabitants of the infected zone all this while.

Occphen:
The infected zone was attacked as well? ?

Occphen:
This......It's messed up.

Occphen:
What about the lord's soldiers? Where are Lord Tulla's soldiers?

Miarow:
The lord's soldiers still haven't appeared. They might be in trouble as well.

Ash:
Mister Watchman, we need your help.

Occphen:
But, what can I do to help? I can't even stand up right now.

Ash:
The Infected townsfolk have also been attacked, with many of them being injured and the buildings of the infected zone suffering heavy damages.

Ash:
We need you to open up the safe house and let them hide in here.

Occphen:
That...

Blitz:
In return, we will guarantee your safety. You can trust us.

Occphen:
But, but I...

Occphen:
Based on the contract I signed with Rhodes Island, the entire safe house is the property of Rhodes Island.

Occphen:
......I don't have the authority......

Occphen:
......

Occphen:
......Ugh......Infected......

Occphen:
Alright, let them come. Losing my job is better than losing my life.

Miarow:
Thank you!
