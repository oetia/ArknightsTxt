7:59 P.M. \ Cloudy

Lungmen Aqueduct, Pier

Stranger:
Now don't go jumping onto any more boats! It's dangerous!

Bison:
Sorry, it's just, we were...

Bison:
By the way, you didn't happen to see a Sankta lady around here, did you?

Stranger:
I didn't see anything. And I don't have time for this. These sweets are for the after party and are you gonna pay me if they turn up late... Oh?

Stranger:
A S- Sankta...

Bison:
Ah! Mostim——

Sora:
Mostima? You know Mostima?

Bison:
Sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

Bison:
(This lady sure looks familiar.)

Stranger:
Ahem. Anyway, I'll let you off this time. But don't go doing anything that dangerous ever again.

Bison:
S- sorry. I didn't mean to trouble you.

Sora:
Hm... Forte kid... there was something about a Forte kid... what was it...?

Sora:
Oh!

Bison:
Aaah! What are you doing?!

Sora:
You had some candy on your horn.

Bison:
Oh, really? I should probably give it back to...

Sora:
And looking at your horns reminded me of something! They're just like the Mountain Dash Logistics logo!

Sora:
You're the little prince of MDL, aren't you?

Bison:
Little... prince...?

Bison:
Sora, ma'am, is this really the way back to Texas and the others?

Sora:
Relax, I know what Texas is thinking at all times. I can see right into her head.

Bison:
Oh.

Bison:
...her voice has such a familiar quality to it, but I can't put my finger on it.

Sora:
'Ma'am,' huh? Hehe, I never thought the day would come when young Messengers would be calling me that~ So what's your impression of everybody?

Bison:
Impression?

Bison:
They're very... um... spirited people.

Sora:
Ahahaha... I can guess what they must've put you through...

Sora:
Oh, sorry!

Child:
Watch where you're going! Ptoo!

Bison:
That was clearly your fault——

Child:
Who asked you? Mind your own business!

Bison:
You little brat!

Sora:
Don't worry about it. Let him go.

Bison:
But he just swiped your wallet——

Sora:
Hehe, he sure did. But that wallet just had some pumpkin candies inside. See? This is the real one~

Sora:
You familiar with the old expression 'trick or treat'?

Bison:
He was here just to make trouble, and today's not even... why would you have something like that?

Sora:
You may not be able to tell at first glance, but Lungmen's been through a lot lately.

Sora:
Sauin candles aren't bright enough to light up all the dark corners of this city, and those kids don't exactly have it easy.

Sora:
But hey, it's just something I came up with. Not bad, huh?

Bison:
What if he grabbed my wallet instead...?

Sora:
Should be right up ahead.

Bison:
Isn't this... the park from before? Did we just make a big circle?

Sora:
See? Here they are.

Mafioso:
Mmmh! Mmff mff!

Exusiai:
Listen, if you don't talk, I'm gonna have to light this fuse.

Croissant:
Yer lips better start flappin', kiddo. These fireworks'll blow ya sky high.

Texas:
...You forgot to take the tape off his mouth.

Exusiai:
Oh, right. Haha.

Mafioso:
——————!!

Mafioso:
You crazy broads! Do you have any idea who we are?

Texas:
...the Siracusan Mafia.

Mafioso:
Urk, T- Texas...? Don't think we're scared of you!

Exusiai:
Oh we know you're not scared. Why else would you blow up all the boss's collectibles. A bomb in a candy box, though? That's kids' stuff.

Mafioso:
...what are you talking about?

Exusiai:
Huh?

Mafioso:
I don't know nothin' about no candy box. But if our capo did up a bomb, you'd all be in pieces—— Mmmf! Mmmh!

Exusiai:
This guy sure is full of himself. Let's blast him.

Texas:
Patience, Exusiai. Let him talk.

Mafioso:
*Gasp*——Hah. Ain't you the least bit curious why Lungmen's lettin' us get away with all this?

Exusiai:
Not really. As long as we go down to the station once a month to pay our property damage fines, they pretty much let us do whatever too.

Mafioso:
Gah...

Croissant:
C'mon, Exu, let the feller say his piece.

Mafioso:
Just look at you broads...!

Mafioso:
We got the big man's OK to do whatever we want to Penguin Logistics, right from the real power in Lungmen. You know what that means, don't you?

Exusiai:
We're a legitimate logistics business? And a pretty good one at that?

Texas:
Then why do we always end up... You know what? Forget it.

Texas:
Who's 'the big man' you're talking about?

Exusiai:
It sounds really pretentious. Super gross.

Mafioso:
Don't play dumb! The Rat King's——

Sora:
Hey! Texas! And the rest!

Exusiai:
Oh, Sora! What's up~

Croissant:
How about that. She wrangled Bison too.

Sora:
Hehe, I ran into this lost little calf on my way over, I thought I'd bring him along.

Bison:
Um... what are you doing? And where's Mr. Emperor?

Exusiai:
The boss went somewhere to do something.

Texas:
You didn't run into anyone else, Sora?

Sora:
Hm? I don't... think... so.

Exusiai:
Huh? Do I have something on my face?

Sora:
N- no. Anyway, Bison filled me in on the whole story. Where do we go from here?

Exusiai:
First we get some more answers from our little buddy, then we formulate an appropriate... response.

Bison:
Wait, Exusiai, do you mean...

Bison:
I actually ran into Mostima back there. But then I lost her.

Bison:
Erm, I mean, after we shook the mobsters, she——

Exusiai:
...don't worry about her. That's just how she is. Vanishing years at a time.

Bison:
...years?

Croissant:
Tell ya the truth, I barely seen heads or tails of her since they hired me.

Sora:
Ahaha, let's not get Exusiai too riled up...

Bison:
This is all very... unorthodox.

Texas:
She's a special kind of Messenger.

Texas:
Contractually, she works for the boss, but more often Laterano has her——

Exusiai:
......

Texas:
——Exusiai, watch your match.

Exusiai:
Huh? Oops.

Mafioso:
MMMMH! MMF——!!

Croissant:
Darn it, looks like we're outta time. But that's the way the cookie crumbles.

Mafioso:
MMMMMNG!!!!!

Mafioso:
Heyo, that sounded like Fronzo! And it didn't sound good!

Mafioso:
Let's get over there!

Exusiai:
So they really can send a person flying. These fireworks are something else.

Texas:
We've got company. Six and three o'clock.
