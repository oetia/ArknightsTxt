Mafioso:
Mr. Rat King.

Rat King:
Oh, it's you.

Mafioso:
What of them?

Rat King:
I said as much, this city has no need of further bloodshed. If they can escape, let them escape.

Rat King:
To miss your old master is noble. And you spent your loyalty to buy the rights of your fellows to live on. That was a charitable act. But you must not get greedy in your requests.

Mafioso:
...Y- yeah. But after that, that was way out of step with Lungmen's rules...

Rat King:
You learn quick.

Rat King:
I have heard that long before Siracusa became what it is today, there was a time when the mafia there had some unwritten rules kept for survival's sake.

Rat King:
The people obeyed them, the people accepted them, and in turbulent times, the mafia came to be the most trusted group in society.

Rat King:
Then, they sold out, they traded in violence, and we came to where we are today.

Rat King:
Lungmen has its laws, and I have my own code.

Rat King:
Even Penguin Logistics has a set of rules for how they do whatever they want at all times, although they're all wildly different.

Mafioso:

Mafioso:
Mr. Rat King, if the boss back then... if Mr. Gambino didn't pull his sword on you the first time you met, would things still have turned out like this?

Rat King:
I gave him a chance. Both before and after that moment. It was far more than just that.

Rat King:
But from time to time, and especially in business, first impressions are very important. You understand?

Mafioso:
...I understand.

Gambino:
...*Pant pant*.

Gambino:
There is... the exit! It's close!

Gambino:
...Who's there?! Come out!

Capone:
So you ain't dead. That's a surprise. Turns out the Rat King ain't so thorough.

Gambino:
...The wound you gave me still aches, Capone. I'm real glad you came to face me yourself.

Gambino:
So I can kill you with my own hands.

Capone:
All of Lungmen's after us. I really don't wanna waste time on you.

Capone:
So let's get this over with.

Gambino:
You're gonna pay for betraying the Family...

???:
Haha. Family. Family, huh.

???:
That word sure brings me back. Hey, have either of you seen Texas?

Capone:
Th- that smell...!

Gambino:
...a Lone Wolf. What are you doing in Lungmen?

Lappland:
Well, Texas is here. Need I say more?

Lappland:
By the way, can you really call yourselves a 'Family' after you bolted from Siracusa to get away from all the responsibilities of being a Family? Can you still call yourselves 'Sicilian?'

Lappland:
Would the one who plundered your proud and glorious history... Miss Sicily herself, would she agree?

Gambino:
Shut up! Don't ever speak of her in front of me!

Gambino:
You're nothin' but a traitor! Who are you to call us...

Lappland:
That's enough, ass.

Lappland:
Oh, you're wounded? I smell blood. Wolf's blood. Mmm, is that what they call the smell of home?

Lappland:
Texas is different now, huh?

Lappland:
Really really different. A couple old friends from Siracusa come knocking on her door and she lets them leave Lungmen alive?

Lappland:
It's so inhospitable. Downright shameful. But it's okay, I'll finish the job for her.

Lappland:
Maybe if I bring her the corpses of a couple paisans from Siracusa that'll get her nice and worked up. Ooh, yeah, that's a great idea...

Lappland:
You think she can escape? From the shadow of her Family, I mean? From her past?

Gambino:
...Capone, stand firm.

Capone:
Hah. Now we're gonna fight side by side? What happened to your honor and Family?

Gambino:
Call it self-preservation.

Capone:
Hmph. You scared?

Gambino:
Let's just say I don't want her to be the one who kills me.

Capone:
...Good point. If I'm gonna die, I'd rather make it to an open casket.

Lappland:
Hahahaha! Are you trembling?

Lappland:
You're going to fight me when you can barely stand up straight?

Lappland:
All right, sure. Watching the life leave your eyes as you struggle to live sounds like a good time.

Lappland:
I'm going to count to ten.

Lappland:
Run.
