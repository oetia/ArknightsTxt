Downtown Lungmen, Cafe Al Fresco

Yith:
A pleasant aroma

Yith:
To enjoy such a lovely al fresco cafe, with a sandwich, by candlelight, as the people go by, with the fragrance of sweet candy,

Yith:
It would be a truly relaxing experience were it not for this young lady staring daggers into me.

???:
...I just happened to be walking by. But that thing you have in your hand isn't the kind of thing that can be explained by happenstance.

Yith:
I have explained. Mostima is acting in her capacity as an employee of Penguin Logistics, and I am helping her guard the staff in her absence.

???:
You think I'm going to let some freak who talks to her staff off the hook?

Yith:
F- freak...? Let's just pretend you didn't see that.

???:
......

Yith:
She will be fine.

???:
I'm not worried about her.

Yith:
Nor will she make trouble.

???:
...I hope you're right.

Yith:
......

???:
......

Yith:
...... (Perhaps I should just stay in the hotel.)

Mostima:
Oh, here you are. What was that back there?

Rat King:
Just a flight of whimsy.

Mostima:
Your whimsy might have been a little too powerful. You knew Penguin Logistics was there, didn't you?

Mostima:
And as old as you are, you probably shouldn't exert yourself like that. You're not looking to cut it short, are you?

Rat King:
Just how much of my power do you think I expended?

Mostima:
...right.

Mostima:
Well how about you take your murderous aura down a notch? I've had just about all the ominous energy I can take.

Mostima:
So what happened?

Rat King:
I may have underestimated the vigilance of the youth. Lungmen's young people never fail to impress me.

Rat King:
It is nothing major, but a few out of control puppets have injured a remarkably dedicated finball master. That is all.

Mostima:
'That is all?' I think you need to work on your expressions before you go saying things like that.

Rat King:
The one who always smiles never truly smiles. Compared to you, I am very relaxed.

Mostima:
Isn't this something you planned for?

Mostima:
Like, in order to prevent this conflict between Penguin Logistics and the mob from turning sour, you went looking for an excuse to punish them? Something like that?

Rat King:
Look at you, girl. It's such a waste to have you scrounging around with that penguin.

Mostima:
I'll take that as a compliment.

Rat King:
...But I did not permit them to go trampling the slums. I would never permit that.

Rat King:
I have reached the end of my patience for their constant oversteps, and yet they still continue to disregard the rules.

Rat King:
I had assumed that if they maintained even a faint connection to Siracusa, they might be of some miniscule, interesting benefit to Lungmen... I am very disappointed.

Mostima:
Wait a second... why are you telling me all of this? This isn't like a 'reveal your whole plan before killing me to keep your secrets' sort of thing, is it?

Rat King:
Old people need to complain.

Mostima:
Oh yeah? Then I'll just treat it like a Sauin Carnival. I didn't hear a word you just said.

Mostima:
The more trouble the mafia stirs up, the bigger the balance I'm due on the other side.

Rat King:
And after you have that money?

Mostima:
The first thing I'll do is buy that candy shop.

Rat King:
Heh. You really are attached.

Rat King:
Fine. Aside from the cellar, everything else is yours.

Mostima:
There's a cellar...? Can't you try to protect my sweet memories, even a little bit?

Rat King:
It's my shop.

Mostima:
That's too bad. I really thought you'd retire as something more like a grocer.

Rat King:
Maybe. If I'm still alive by the time I retire.

Rat King:
Time grows short. The Carnival is about to begin. The players in this show are already in position.

Mostima:
You're not watching from the sidelines anymore?

Rat King:
...the scenery here is lovely, isn't it?

Rat King:
Sauin is all about honoring the dead. And Lungmen is our city, after all.

Rat King:
When the living enjoy their lively carousing, only then may the souls of the dead depart without regret.

Rat King:
And if we have a rat with one foot in a coffin, unless it moves, one might mistake it for a deceased soul ready to depart.

Mostima:
How are we supposed to do 'lively carousing?'

Rat King:
Just like this.

Mostima:
Oh... I see.

Mostima:
Then this Sauin's expenses must be pretty high. Wasteful, even.

Rat King:
Smart girl.

Mostima:
Otherwise, Chief Wei would've come after you a long time ago.

Rat King:
Let's not speak of such matters. I certainly don't want to talk to the LGD again. So annoying.

Rat King:
But the key to a good show is when the actors foot the bill themselves.

Bison:
*Pant* *pant* Are those guys mobsters too? How much farther do we have to run?

Exusiai:
Definitely not. They might be some of those thugs we ran into before. There's too many of them. Don't want to think about it. Just run. We can lose them.

Bison:
But I just saw a guy running at us with a rolling pin...

Exusiai:
That's how these fights usually go. You don't come to the slums often?

Exusiai:
Sometimes they end up rolling some blood or teeth into the dough, and then a customer gets all pissed off when he bites into somebody else's tooth.

Bison:
I really didn't need such a detailed explanation.

Bison:
...Have you known Mostima for a long time?

Exusiai:
You're getting pretty friendly with me now.

Bison:
Mostima said she was testing me...

Exusiai:
Oh? I never heard about that.

Bison:
...I guess I didn't either.

Exusiai:
Why do you look up to her so much? It's really different from the way you treat the rest of us.

Bison:
She's kind of like... everything I ever hoped to be as a Messenger. She's done everything I ever hoped to do.

Bison:
...I really envy her.

Bison:
Even though I don't really get what's going on in her head.

Exusiai:
That's how it goes. I chased her from Laterano to Lungmen, then I met the boss, and all the way up to today, I still don't know what's going on in her head.

Exusiai:
I've since given up. It's easier to just wait until she pops up right behind me.

Bison:
Don't be so gloomy... Wait, did you say from Laterano to Lungmen?

Exusiai:
Uh huh. You caught that, did you? Don't give me that look. I'm just as good as Mostima. Maybe she's a little bit ahead, but...

Bison:
No, it really doesn't matter to me. We should focus on meeting up with Texas.

Exusiai:
Hrm.

Texas:
Hm.

Croissant:
Wasn't that a little too hard?

Sora:
That's justified self-defense. Don't sweat it.

Exusiai:
Hey! Texas~

Texas:
You're okay. But where's Mostima?

Exusiai:
Do you really have to ask? She Mostima'd.

Texas:
Oh. Sorry.

Exusiai:
What are you sorry about? And what are you all looking at me for?

Sora:
Ahaha... Mostima came back. We'll see her again sooner or later.

Sora:
But first, we should probably deal with these new bad guys...

Croissant:
So what's this all about?

Croissant:
Some kinda revenge for us bein' too rowdy?

Exusiai:
Maybe.

Bison:
Maybe?! Are the slums always this violent?!

Croissant:
Can't make friends if you don't throw down. Talkin' with yer fists is the oldest form of communication!

Texas:
Got a call. It's the boss.

Emperor:
What's crackin'?

Emperor:
You ladies havin' fun? Feel like you're missing something?

Emperor:
No? Good. Listen up.

Bison:
Mr. Emperor... did you happen to buy a lot of insurance?

Emperor:
There's a big Carnival Gala down on Luk Low Street for Sauin tonight. They got some no-name marketing thing going on.

Emperor:
But I decided I'm gonna make an appearance there as your big time rap god.

Emperor:
We'll bring some fire beats to Lungmen. They break down in tears, and bow down all nice and tidy.

Emperor:
As for you, you're gonna watch my back. Then you scoop up all these wannabes chasin' us in one fell swoop.

Emperor:
Got it? Got it. Good. Make it happen.

Texas:
...He hung up.

Croissant:
Feels like deja vu all over again.

Sora:
So I guess we have to go to that party thing too?

Exusiai:
Yep. Let's hit the road!
