Bison:
The shots are coming from above? Are they up on the overpass?

Bison:
How high is the angle of attack? Where could they be shooting from?

Bison:
Doesn't matter. First I've got to——!

Bison:
Nng——!

Bison:
Oof!

Bison:
I- I'm okay. What's this...? It's sticky...

Bison:
A Sauin candle? Real lucky these were here...

???:
You got one stuck in your horn too.

Bison:
Huh? Oh, thanks. I guess I better yank it... out——!

???:
Don't move, candle boy.

???:
Quiet. Take cover behind that crate.

Mafioso:
We lost Fronzo's signal. Oughta be around here somewhere!

Mafioso:
Penguin Logistics is here too. Tell the boss as soon as you spot the target.

???:
You can come out.

Bison:
Oh, okay...

Bison:
I appreciate your help, but you really don't wanna get mixed up in this. You better go somewhere safe.

???:
I'd love to. It's been a while since I had a trip to Lungmen. But a job's a job...

???:
Considering how I found you, I'm guessing your deal with Penguin Logistics isn't going so well?

Bison:
...you could say that.

Bison:
Err, who are you, exactly? I get the feeling you're not a typical passer-by.

???:
Calm down. Let's just say I'm not your enemy.

???:
Whoops, they're coming back. Hide.

Mafioso A:
Mamma mia! Those Penguin bastards got Fronzo! What're we gonna do?

Mafioso B:
That Bison kid's all alone. This could be our big break.

Mafioso A:
Can we really just yoink him in the middle of downtown Lungmen?

Mafioso B:
Mr. Capone says as long as we do it nice and quiet-like, hold off on the guns and bombs, Lungmen won't make a fuss.

Mafioso B:
Nobody's gonna go looking in those filthy old alleyways, eh?

Mafioso A:
Then we'll be the backup, you find the kid. Capiche?

???:
Well, we can't stay here. Let's get going.

???:
Let's see... over there. Let's say hello.

Croissant:
Ya find Bison yet, baws?

Emperor:
I'm wearin' shades, not binoculars. Gimme some space!

Emperor:
Aight... I see 'im. Waving at me.

Exusiai:
Well let's go get him, then come back and ask this guy what they're up to.

Mafioso:
Mmmf—— Mmmh——

Emperor:
Nah.

Emperor:
Looks like our lucky little Bison had a smooth landing. He can get hisself back here.

Croissant:
Um... he took a forty-foot drop onto a smooth landin'? How's that?

Exusiai:
And the bad guys are kinda hunting for him. You sure we shouldn't go get him?

Emperor:
She's got him.

Exusiai:
...She's back?

Texas:
Exusiai, stay focused.

Mafioso:
There they are! We gotta spring Fronzo!

Exusiai:
Sigh. There's just no end to you people.

???:
I think we lost them.

???:
So what's Texas and the girls gotten themselves into this time? Who are they fighting now?

Bison:
Can I really trust you?

???:
I guess I better introduce myself. I'm Mostima. A Messenger for Penguin Logistics.

Mostima:
I think that makes me your colleague, for now. I usually work alone though.

Bison:
...Mostima. I've heard that name from my father before.

Bison:
(Not to mention a Sankta with black horns... the rumors were true. Better not ask about them though...)

Mostima:
Oh...? Good things I hope?

Bison:
Erm... how should I say...? Just baseless rumors...

Bison:
And after you saved me like that, I have no reason to doubt you. Sorry.

Mostima:
Don't worry about it. You got nothing to apologize for.

Bison:
Thanks... Now we should share our intelligence... although I'm still pretty confused.

Bison:
Basically, Penguin Logistics is in some kind of conflict with an arm of the Siracusan mafia.

Mostima:
Right. Got it.

Bison:
Huh? You got it already?

Mostima:
I don't need any more. You need to stop thinking so much. Trust your instincts. That's the Penguin Logistics way.

Bison:
Oh. So the trick is to just stop thinking, huh...?

Mostima:
They're a very special bunch. Common sense doesn't really work here.

Bison:
...What about you, Mostima?

Mostima:
Are you always this direct with people?

Bison:
I- I think so.

Mostima:
We need to get moving.

Mostima:
Follow me.

Mafioso:
Eyo, you found the target yet?

Mafioso:
There's too many people. Hey, I'm walkin' here!

Mafioso:
C'mon, let's check somewhere else.

Bison:
...I don't think they saw us.

Mostima:
Just keep going like this, and we'll figure out a way to meet back up with the others.

Bison:
Right.

Mostima:
Hm.

Bison:
Wh- what is it?

Mostima:
If we keep going like this, we'll end up...

Bison:
G- getting caught by the mob?!

Mostima:
So that's where it was. It's been so many years since I've been back to Lungmen. All the signs are different.

Mostima:
Right... are you hungry? I'm trying to decide between matcha and chocolate.

Bison:
......
