Gambino:
...I'm tired of this.

Waai Fu:
Nng——!

Gambino:
You're strong. And you've shown me some really cool kung fu.

Gambino:
But I can't keep playin' with you like this.

Gambino:
Real sorry about this, but you, your buddy, and that traitor, you all gotta die here.

Gambino:
Boys, weapons ready.

Mafioso A:
Ready!

Waai Fu:
So you're going to win with sheer numbers...?

Capone:
It ain't so simple, Gambino.

Capone:
Listen up, once the so-called 'boss' opens fire, that's the official announcement of the end of your affiliation with the Gambino Family. Don't go easy on 'em.

Mafioso B:
Got it!

Jaye:
Waai Fu, this side too...

Waai Fu:
We're getting boxed in.

Gambino:
Hah. We got the Family all split up, and the prey becomes the predator. We got a nice chaotic battle here each fallin' into each other's traps.

Gambino:
It's just like that time back in Siracusa... But this time, it's a gamble we got no choice but to win.

Capone:
Too bad you've always been a shit gambler.

Rat King:
All right. That's enough. Settle down.

Capone:
What!

Gambino:
You finally crawled out of your filthy hole?

Rat King:
Mr. Gambino, I am truly sorry, but I've given you and your Family so many chances.

Gambino:
We got no trust between us at all. You really think I'd hand the Family over to some non-Sicilian freak?

Rat King:
Sicilian. While I have not once in my life set foot in a Siracusan city, I do know that you are unworthy of describing yourself as such.

Gambino:
...What are you gonna do?

Rat King:
The time for questions has passed, young man. And you have broken the rules far too many times.

Rat King:
Once was your transgression, another was yours. But it matters not. You have both overstepped your bounds.

Capone:
......

Gambino:
You goin' back on your deal?

Rat King:
I made no deal.

Gambino:
Hmph. You really think you can take us?

Gambino:
You sit on a throne in a stinking sewer, telling desperate people who got no choice but to throw down their lives what to do. That's you.

Rat King:
It behooves you, as head of your household, to broaden your horizons.

Rat King:
Compared to everything we have been through, your little Siracusan fiasco was a stubbed toe.

Gambino:
Shut up!

Rat King:
Have you ever seen a true onslaught? What it means to truly have barbarians at your gates?

Rat King:
When moving cities crash against one another, smoke chokes the skies, and the dying infected rot away by cesspools, crying in hopeless agony?

Rat King:
You know nothing. And yet you think to fight a city.

Capone:
(He's immensely powerful... him and that woman with him...)

Capone:
(Shit, we have to at least stop provoking the Rat King... now is not the time...)

Gambino:
You think you stand for all of Lungmen?

Rat King:
Lungmen certainly cannot stand for me.

Gambino:
Enough talk! Haah——!

Gambino:
——

Waai Fu:
No one will permit you to strike this old man.

Jaye:
Get back, Waai Fu!

Gambino:
Out of my way!

Rat King:
Thank you. You are Ah Fil. I've heard your story.

Jaye:
You're the one Uncle always talks about...

Rat King:
Heh, my old friend.

Rat King:
I thank you for helping Lungmen put a stop to them. And I thank you for your pursuit of justice.

Rat King:
Now, please leave.

Waai Fu:
But...

Rat King:
I promised many times to many people that I would not let the children get mixed up in such matters.

Jaye:
...Waai Fu.

Waai Fu:
Fine.

Rat King:
The children are gone. And with them your hope of victory.

Rat King:
Put down your weapons, kneel before me, and your 'Family' will have at least some chance to survive.

Gambino:
Do you really think your threats mean anything?

Rat King:
...You are on our land. It means to us what Siracusa means to you. You must know this much.

Rat King:
You still have some chips on the table, young man. Wouldn't you like to save them?

Mafioso A:
Qui- quicksand?! Run!

Mafioso B:
Aaaaaagh! My hand! D- don't touch the sand!

Gambino:
You cocky——

Gambino:
Hmph.

Rat King:
Calm yourself, young man. I don't need my hands to stop your sword.

Rat King:
Look around you at your companions. This city has bled so much already. I really don't want to see 'Family' killing one another on the program.

Rat King:
This is your last chance.

Gambino:
I ain't gonna turn coward again. Leaving Siracusa was the last step backwards for my Family.

Gambino:
I'd rather die here like a true Sicilian than ever let the enemy see me run off with my tail between my legs.

Rat King:
Perhaps in your mind, this is the way for a warrior to behave. But for a leader, going too far is as bad as not going far enough.

Rat King:
You should reflect, and introspect. Unfortunately, it is too late.

Gambino:
Aaaagh!!

Capone:
...This is the end, Gambino. You should never have bet the whole Family on this.

Gambino:
Capone, you, you son of a——!

Capone:
Calm down. We don't want you to go out too hard.

Gambino:
Gah!

Capone:
Funny. You don't look surprised at all. Were you waiting for me to do this?

Rat King:
What are you thinking, backstabbing boss-killer?

Capone:
I'll offer up the whole Family. We're gonna live here, in Lungmen. And we're not gonna fall on our swords for no good reason.

Rat King:
It's too bad... if you were truly willing to work together, that woman never would have exiled you from Siracusa.

Capone:
You know a lot about us... But I'm not gonna ask. It's Lungmen.

Rat King:
Indeed. It's Lungmen.

Rat King:
You mean I should be easier on you, since you're willing to personally discipline the disobedient?

Capone:
My Family will take orders from you.

Rat King:
'Your Family.'

Rat King:
You are simply describing the situation as it is. You made so many miscalculations you have no other choice.

Capone:
Right. It's been a hell of a night. I've had a lotta setbacks. But that's business.

Rat King:
Mmm... Business.

Rat King:
You're absolutely right. This is an excellent deal. Fair and equitable.

Capone:
Then——!

Rat King:
But, Mr. Capone, it's Lungmen.

Rat King:
It's not me.

Capone:
——

Rat King:
I have no need of your loyalty. Never did.

Capone:
......

Capone:
You... from the very beginning, you were...

Mafioso:
It's what it is. We gotta survive.

Rat King:
When you tried to worm your way into Lungmen, your mutual suspicion ground turned you up into a sheet of sand. A stone is hard to break. But sand? I can easily scoop up a handful.

Rat King:
I have no love of trickery. It's really no fun at all. What matters is what I said a few minutes ago: I truly do not wish to see family massacre family...

Rat King:
And yet you did harm to your own brother, right in front of me.

Rat King:
Now for this, I would not say you've crossed the ultimate line. So I will not kill you.

Rat King:
It's just that, since you disobeyed me, I'm afraid I have no need of such a crafty and conniving friend.

Capone:
You...! You had these moles in the Family from the very beginning! And you waited until we got at each other's throats, and then you...!

Capone:
Gah!

Rat King:
You're wasting your life on idle words, young man.

Rat King:
Heh... while you toyed around with the power over them, your underlings were mulling it all over for you. Truly remarkable.

Rat King:
Their loyalty has bought them a chance to survive in Lungmen. And a life for each of you as well.

Rat King:
Now then, you have seen for yourselves the choices made by these two leaders, and now the time has come for you to fulfill your commitments.

Capone:
...Heh.

Capone:
Rat King. No, Lin. Lin Gray, you're more Sicilian than either of us.

Capone:
You tore my honor to shreds, and then you let me live? Are you trying to humiliate me?

Mafioso:
——!

Rat King:
......

Rat King:
Astonishing. To save your life, you don't hesitate to draw a sword on your own brother, your own leader, and yet when I offer to let you live, you are determined to die?

Rat King:
I thought only the one out cold over there would gnash his teeth at me so.

Capone:
That's because I too am 'Sicilian.'

Capone:
Or I guess I should ask if you really thought you could wipe out one of Siracusa's 'Families' and get away with it?

Rat King:
Idle threats. You must know that nobody will go to war over an erased Family. Take a step back and see that even though some hopeless, scattered warriors may ignorantly think to act...

Rat King:
...I say let them come. Let them be torn to shreds by the true rage of this city.

Capone:
Grr!

Rat King:
You alone have no power to stand against us.

Rat King:
Now. Go.

Capone:
......

Capone:
...I guess my life just has to go on for now, but one day you'll regret that you didn't kill me, a true Sicilian, today.

Capone:
No question.

Rat King:
...If I were to send a man to kill him now, what would you do?

Mafioso:
You wouldn't do that.

Rat King:
But what he said is true. I have no reason to be so lenient with a Siracusan mafioso.

Mafioso:
We had a deal. When we came face to face, we'd defect, and you'd let the others go.

Rat King:
Unless, of course, the remaining mobsters force a fight to the death.

Mafioso:
......

Rat King:
Heh heh. Don't worry. He didn't mean that. He's simply a coward who wants to live. But his anger is not feigned.

Rat King:
An unrighteous man has nothing for which to live.

Rat King:
Remarkable. His negligible dignity saved his life, in the end.

Mafioso:
...Thanks.

Rat King:
Go. It is time to bring this evening to its conclusion.
