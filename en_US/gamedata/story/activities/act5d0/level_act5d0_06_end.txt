Emperor:
Well if it ain't a Siracusan stray right here in my lounge. You're all outta crossbow bolts? And I'm still standin'?

Gambino:
So this is the Emperor. You come through a rain of arrows still holding your drink. Lucky bastard.

Sora:
...Lungmen isn't much for straight up, close-quarters fighting.

Exusiai:
If you don't play by the rules, you get kicked out of the game.

Gambino:
Rules?

Gambino:
By the time the cops get here, all they're gonna find are your splattered corpses, Penguin Logistics.

Bison:
...it's all their people out there.

Croissant:
They got the back covered too. Looks like this feller's mighty thorough.

Gambino:
That coward Capone is too afraid of the Rat King and Wei Yenwu, even if that one might need a thought or two...

Gambino:
But you and the Rat King? You ain't worth a second look.

Emperor:
Yeah? Is that really what you think? Or you just tryin' to sound scary?

Gambino:
I believe it with all my heart, 'Mr. Emperor.'

Emperor:
Croissant, grab me a bottle. Our friend here's got the broke brain. I'm gonna do him a favor and fix it up for him.

Croissant:
But baws, not for nothin', we already smashed a couple million Lungmen dollars' worth of booze over here.

Emperor:
...and how much were their lives worth?

Croissant:
Don't see how it could add up to that much.

Emperor:
......

Texas:
Are we doing this?

Emperor:
Nah. We're keeping the deal we made with Lil Wei. We don't go all out in Lungmen, we don't make trouble, we don't threaten life and limb. Keep it professional. Business is business.

Emperor:
But we been on the run for a grand total of five hours today. That's double my normal work day. Double!

Emperor:
Not to mention we torched a whole year's worth of goodies! Cars, booze, and my precious vinyl!

Emperor:
And now we got some tragic, unanticipated deaths here in my club. What're we gonna do about all this? Hm?

Texas:
Understood.

Gambino:
Texas. This name of yours displeases me.

Texas:
I don't recall knowing any Siracusans like you. But you're about to go running out of Lungmen with your tail between your legs.

Gambino:
You're gonna regret slandering my family, Texas.

Gambino:
Who here's the stray dog who ran off to Lungmen? You know the truth. You ain't fit to go toe to toe with a Sicilian.

Texas:
......

Gambino:
That's a good face right, there, Texas! You almost look Siracusan like that!

Mostima:
Wow.

Mostima:
This is a surprise. You got called out too?

???:
You could say that. But it's honestly a relief to get pulled away from those cocktail parties.

Mostima:
Hm. Does a small-time mafia dust-up really deserve such a grand response?

???:
No, it doesn't. But it makes for a nice excuse to tear myself away from troublesome social interactions.

???:
Croissant has ordered a new custom accessory for her hammer. Exusiai has sought my help in caring for her beloved gun. In short, there is much to be done.

Mostima:
Yeah, I might have something for you too.

???:
No matter. Assisting my colleagues with such trivialities is one of my duties, in addition to my primary function.

Mostima:
Can you look after this staff for me?

???:
This white one. You do understand its significance, don't you?

Mostima:
Just for tonight. Let me relax a bit and enjoy the Carnival.

Mostima:
I can't exactly take it out onto the dance floor with me. I'll lose control.

???:
Of course. I will take it. It's my responsibility.

Mostima:
Heh. It always comes down to work, huh? Thanks anyway.

Mostima:
You want to go for a drink afterwards? It's on me.

???:
I would love to. Socializing over drinks with colleagues is vastly more meaningful than the empty social niceties I've endured.

???:
But I'm afraid, looking at these movements, it may be a challenge to save The Ends of the Earth.

Mostima:
...So, did you just get in to Lungmen? How much do you know about what's gone on tonight?

???:
Everything. The threads that make up this year's Carnival are uncomplicated. The tapestry is abundantly clear to me.

Mostima:
Are you not going to help?

???:
I am not. I will leave the physical labor to your youthful vigor, look after your items, enjoy a cup of tea, and wait for the situation to resolve itself.

???:
Right then. The Rat King is waiting for you. Do please enjoy yourself.

Mostima:
You too, Yith.

Mostima:
It's Sauin. It only comes once a year. Don't work yourself too hard.

Mostima:
Anyway, I'm out.

Yith:
...Sauin?

Yith:
Oh my. I was supposed to take off for Sauin.

Yith:
And here I am working overtime like always... what a dreadful waste.

Yith:
But at least, now that she's entrusted you to me, we can reminisce about the good old days, my old friend.

Yith:
Mm. It's nice to grip you in my hand like this. No complaining.

Texas:
You have nowhere to run.

Gambino:
*Pant pant* Texas, you got the skills to match your name... Your Family——

Texas:
Shut up.

Exusiai:
Texaaas~ I've taken out more than you~

Sora:
But Texas is holding down their leader. That's gotta be worth at least three?

Exusiai:
Wha? So I'm losing?

Croissant:
Naw. Nobody else is even countin'.

Croissant:
Oh, we still got a bottle over here. Lemme check the price tag.

Croissant:
That's one, two, three... seven! Seven zeroes! Thank you, Lady Luck!

Mafioso:
What're you scared of? There's only five of 'em!

Emperor:
No cliches in my club, please!

Mafioso:
Gah! My head... nng...

Emperor:
And you didn't even count me. There's six of us.

Bison:
Six Penguin Logistics employees against an entire armed mob... and the logistics firm wins...?

Bison:
...that's kinda weird, isn't it?

Croissant:
Ain't nothin' weird about that. When it comes to team fights, we're the best in Lungmen! Long as the numbers ain't too different.

Gambino:
Gah!

Texas:
You lost. Give up.

Gambino:
Lost? Give up? Hah. Are you really THE 'Texas?'

Gambino:
When Sicilians cross swords, there ain't no winning or losing, there's only life or death.

Gambino:
You must regret not biting the bullet and finishing the job!

Mafioso:
Fire in the hole!

Texas:
Grrr! Take cover!

Bison:
Aagh! Another bomb!

Texas:
......

Texas:
...we let them get away again.

Exusiai:
Should we go after them?

Texas:
No. I may have underestimated them a bit.

Texas:
Even if they're a bunch of losers who ran off to Lungmen, they're still Sicilian mobsters.

Sora:
Texas, are you hurt?! L- let me take care of you.

Texas:
It's not deep, don't worry.

Sora:
I'm worrying! Sit down. I'll get the first aid kit...

Bison:
Sicilians... what's a Sicilian anyway? Is it a kind of Siracusan?

Texas:
The Sicilian Union is one of the origins of Siracusa's Twelve Families. It was the first city to turn to violence to achieve its goals.

Texas:
It's where we get the word 'Sicilian' in Siracusan.

Texas:
But these days... the word has kind of a different meaning... it's pretty rare for a Siracusan to actually call herself a 'Sicilian.'

Texas:
They're not as strong as they used to be... for a whole bunch of reasons. But if they still call themselves that... well...

Exusiai:
Breathe, Texas, breathe. You're wearing yourself out talking that much.

Exusiai:
The main point is it's a way for wannabe dangerous mobsters to tell everybody they think they're dangerous mobsters, right?

Texas:
...yeah.

Bison:
We can't let them keep ambushing us like this. Our losses are only going to get worse.

Bison:
We have to hit back, we need a...

Emperor:
Hold up. Just everybody hold the eff up. What excuse do you think I can give to my dumbass alcohol allergic bartender friend to explain what happened to his place?

Croissant:
Um... is there an explanation...?

Croissant:
At least the stool yer sittin' on's in great shape there, boss.

Emperor:
All we got left's one barstool?

Sora:
Yes... that one barstool.

Emperor:
...Aight. Broken bottles, shot up walls, and tattered velvet got its own unique vibe to it. Yeah. This is my new renovation, redecoratin' the joint!

Exusiai:
Noooo way. Nobody's going to buy that.

Croissant:
We prob'ly just gotta pay him back for all the damages, huh? Aaagh. Looks like we're gonna hafta tighten our belts at Penguin Logistics fer a while.

Texas:
Plus the whole place stinks of alcohol. And I'm all sticky. At least it's disinfecting my wounds.

Sora:
Don't be stupid, you can't use wine as a disinfectant! Here, I've got some medical alcohol... why is there a straw? N- never mind. Here, Texas, let me apply it...

Emperor:
...I had another idea.

Emperor:
If these punks gotta come at us on Sauin...

Emperor:
Then we gotta send 'em peacefully to the afterlife.
