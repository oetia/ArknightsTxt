Exusiai:
Yahoo!

Croissant:
Eyes on the road, Exusiai! Hands on ten and two!

Texas:
I finally caught you.

Sora:
Texas... please... slower next time...

Texas:
S- sorry. I was holding back as much as I could.

Exusiai:
But at least we're all back together. Now we gotta go find the boss.

Exusiai:
Wait, why do I feel like we're missing something?

Texas:
Huh?

Texas:
...where's Bison?

Exusiai:
What? Wasn't he with you guys?

Texas:
......

Sora:
...We didn't leave him back there did we?

Texas:
...We're so used to doing things our own way, leaving him behind was kind of inevitable.

Sora:
So then we should probably go back and get him?

Exusiai:
Isn't Mostima here? I think he'll be okay.

Bison:
Hey! W- waait up! *Cough* *hack*

Sora:
...A bicycle?

Croissant:
Wowee! If you'n keep up with Texas on a bicycle, yer somethin' else, Bison!

Mafioso:
Hey! Which alley'd he go down?!

Mafioso:
That way!

Exusiai:
He's got a lot of guys on his tail.

Texas:
Let's not be too hard on the kid who shook off a crew of armed mobsters on a bicycle.

Texas:
...No, it's an ambush. Exusiai!

Exusiai:
A little late for that!

Bison:
Nng!

Bison:
I did it! I caught them!

Gambino:
Sure did. Thanks for leading the way.

Bison:
Who——

Gambino:
Good night, sweet prince.

Bison:
Oof.

Texas:
Damn. A second too late.

Gambino:
Good evening, Penguin Logistics. I am Gambino Ricci, head of the Family.

Gambino:
And it looks like I've got a hostage.

Gambino:
But you ain't gonna make a scene over a little thing like this, eh?

Exusiai:
We left him behind...

Croissant:
Ain't that the honest truth.

Texas:
What do you want?

Gambino:
Hmph... I'm sick of you scuttling around like cockroaches, getting into my business, makin' yourselves a real pain in my tail.

Gambino:
That's the value of the little prince here. I got a hostage and all you can do is take me head on.

Gambino:
And that'll save me a lotta trouble. That turns my little penguin problem into a very solvable problem.

Gambino:
Penguin Logistics got nowhere to run.

Texas:
Yeah, okay. Great. Just the way I like it.

Gambino:
...What?

Texas:
Turns out we're thinking in the same direction.

Texas:
Croissant, Sora, form up.

Texas:
Exusiai, cover us.

Texas:
Let's get our Bison back.
