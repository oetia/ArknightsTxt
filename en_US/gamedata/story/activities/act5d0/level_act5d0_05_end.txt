Lungmen Slums

Mafioso A:
Tell us where the Rat King is and nobody has to die!

Slum Dweller:
Wh- what?! What's a Rat King... I don't even know what that is!

Mafioso A:
I dare you to say 'what' again...!

Mafioso B:
Hey, Mr. Capone said not to rough up civilians...

Mafioso A:
Does this piece of shit look like a civilian to you? I bet you're Infected, ain't you, cazzo? You still wanna play dumb?!

Slum Dweller:
P- please! Don't hurt me! I really don't know anything!

Mafioso A:
Cat got your tongue?!

Slum Dweller:
Ng... gah... glehh...

Mafioso B:
C'mon, forget about this one. It ain't worth it.

Mafioso B:
Checking our list, looks like the next lucky contestant is some poor finball hawker. Lives right around here.

Mafioso A:
Sounds like a waste of time.

Slum Dweller:
Gah... aaagh! They broke... my arm... those sons of...

Slum Dweller:
I have to... tell them...

Mafioso A:
That's him. Over there.

Jaye:
......

Waai Fu:
...Can I help you?

Mafioso B:
(Hold up. Check the mug over there. I got a bad feeling about him.)

Mafioso A:
(Some Lungmen triad? Mr. Capone says they're a bunch of pushovers.)

Mafioso A:
I got a question for ya.

Mafioso A:
We don't want any trouble, right? Just give us a clean answer and we'll be on our way.

Jaye:
...There's blood on your knuckles.

Mafioso A:
Oh, pardon me. I was cleaning out the trash earlier.

Mafioso A:
But a couple of upright citizens like yourselves, you ain't trash, are you?

Waai Fu:
Is that a threat?

Mafioso A:
You're a smart girl, you can figure it out.

Waai Fu:
Then I refuse to help you.

Mafioso B:
...refuse?

Mafioso B:
I think that came out wrong, girly.

Mafioso B:
It sounded like you said you were dumpster garbage eager to get beaten half to death in that alleyway over there?

Jaye:
Waai Fu, I'm pretty sure that scream I just heard was...

Waai Fu:
Was 'garbage,' the word you just used?

Waai Fu:
Because one must be thorough and prepared for all eventualities, I will ask one more question: is that how you refer to the people here?

Mafioso A:
I don't got time to waste talkin' shit with you, start talk——

Mafioso A:
Wh- what was that?!

Mafioso A:
You better——

Mafioso A:
Gah?!

Waai Fu:
Next.

Waai Fu:
You know what, the kind of scum you are, I'll take you all on at once.

Waai Fu:
Not once in recorded history has evil triumphed over justice, and you evildoers who indiscriminately prey on the weak are not even worth a mention.

Mafioso B:
What is this?! How does she move like that?

Mafioso A:
Just shoot her alrea——

Jaye:
...not so fast.

Mafioso A:
Gah! Hey! Let go of me!

Jaye:
You know what you remind me of? A rotten finfish three days after the freezer lost power.

Mafioso A:
What are you talking about?

Jaye:
...nothing. I shouldn't try to copy Waai Fu's battle banter. I'll take the direct approach.

Jaye:
Heh.

Mafioso A:
S- so strong! Agh! Y- you're gonna break my arm! Stop!

Jaye:
Drop your weapon. And get out of my sight.

Mafioso A:
Al- alright already! Just let me go!

Jaye:
...I should probably break a bone or two just to be safe. You've got a real dangerous weapon there, after all.

Mafioso A:
Aaagh! P- please stop!

Mafioso B:
Wh- what's the deal with these two? Nobody warned us about any targets around here!

Mafioso A:
Just get the hell outta here first. We'll talk later.

Mafioso A:
I don't care what crew you guys are with, next time ain't gonna go your way. Damned Lungmenites.

Jaye:
Come on, we're not triads. Why do they always have to judge a book by its cover...?

Waai Fu:
Forget it, there's people to save. Over there!

Jaye:
Oh, right.

Jaye:
Don't move! We're here to help!

Slum Dweller:
Ah Fil?

Jaye:
You're fine. It's just a flesh wound. Sit still and I'll go get a doctor. I won't be long.

Slum Dweller:
Ah Fil! Don't worry about me. You have to go find Uncle Tung!

Slum Dweller:
That's where they're going next!

Jaye:
