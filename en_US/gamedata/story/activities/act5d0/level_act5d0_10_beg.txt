Little Girl:
Grandpa Rat~!

Rat King:
Why are you out here all alone, little one? And your face is filthy. Were you crawling through air ducts again?

Little Girl:
Hehe, Uncle Ho gave this to me, Grandpa Rat! Uncle Ho said I'm small and I run fast, and if I got this to you quick enough he'd give me a yogurt. You have to tell him I did it!

Rat King:
Don't worry, Grandpa will tell him. Now you run along.

Little Girl:
Thanks, Grandpa! Bye byee~!

Rat King:
......

Seemingly Ordinary Resident:
Something wrong, Uncle?

Rat King:
Do you recall those Siracusans who came looking for us some time ago? The rest of their 'Family' has since come to Lungmen.

Seemingly Ordinary Resident:
Should I contact our spy?

Rat King:
No need for that. Let us bide our time. They will come to us on their own.

Seemingly Ordinary Resident:
What for?

Rat King:
To survive in Lungmen.

Seemingly Ordinary Resident:
But it's not like they need anyone's permission for that. They might as well take a meeting with a Catastrophe.

Rat King:
If Catastrophes could speak, maybe we wouldn't need to fight each other.

Capone:
...it's just like you said, Mr. Rat King.

Capone:
It's Lungmen. Lungmen's got its own rules Wei Yenwu agreed to a decade ago. We ain't about to go breakin' 'em.

Capone:
But you're the executive. That's why we're here to pay our respects.

Rat King:
...You want to wipe out Penguin Logistics, and take their place.

Capone:
Exactly.

Rat King:
You don't know much about them, Sicilians. This deal would not be of benefit to you.

Gambino:
Hmph.

Capone:
(Gambino!)

Gambino:
Are you tryin' to tell us we can't win? Mr. 'Rat King'?

Rat King:
Winning and losing are words that have no place in a business discussion. No wonder you had to flee Siracusa. You are no match for that woman.

Gambino:
You insult the Family?

Capone:
Quiet, Gambino! We're after Penguin Logistics here...

Rat King:
You need only follow the rules. I am not here to protect Penguin Logistics.

Capone:
What do you mean?

Rat King:
Penguin Logistics is on its face a legal entity. The only thing that can protect it is the ironclad law of Lungmen.

Rat King:
But they do, from time to time, cause offense to various stakeholders. And they never take it appropriately seriously.

Rat King:
But bear in mind, Sicilians, you must never overstep your bounds.

Rat King:
An unconventional order is not the same as disorder. Siracusans should understand this more than anyone. But you must never again bring trouble to these old bones of mine. Promise me that.

Capone:
...I understand.

Rat King:
There are so many more stars in Lungmen this time of year. So many more than you'd think.

Rat King:
The tea on the table has gone cold, hasn't it?

Passerby:
This is Uncle's... Hey, we're on the clock.

Passerby:
I'm not deaf. I'm on it. Once I'm done let's go get tea.

Mafioso:
Looks like it's our turn.

Mafioso:
We paid our respects, put down our crossbows, and made sure not to hurt any civilians.

Mafioso:
...all nice and proper-like under the new rules.

Croissant:
So we're surrounded? Six or so deep on all sides?

Exusiai:
Oh, like a roll cake?

Texas:
The Rat King is the boss of the slums. Of course his claws and teeth are everywhere.

Bison:
Why didn't you say so earlier?

Texas:
I thought he was just an urban legend. And I never imagined he'd actually be a rat. Who would take a nickname like that?

Croissant:
With all them people around, it's too hard to tell who's after us and who's a passerby!

Sora:
We don't have a lot of room to act here.

Bison:
What do we do?

Texas:
You're always asking what to do. Don't you ever think for yourself?

Bison:
......

Texas:
Here they come.

Rat King:
Here you are. I think you can make out the situation from up here.

Rat King:
Your friends are locked in a life or death struggle. Aren't you going to help them?

Mostima:
From what I've heard of you, I never thought you'd be so heavy handed.

Rat King:
I don't share every last thought of mine with the young people.

Mostima:
Sure enough. I always forget what kind of person you are.

Rat King:
Many have forgotten as much. And they all ended up six feet deep in an unmarked grave. You're already among the luckiest.

Mostima:
You killed the boss. You think that'll just blow over?

Rat King:
Heh heh. It's all very clear to me.

Rat King:
The owner of Penguin Logistics has always acted so prideful, as if above everyone else. But Lungmen is changing. She cannot allow this to continue.

Rat King:
They needed to be taught a lesson. And a very harsh one at that.

Mostima:
There's always a comeuppance when you bite the hand that feeds.

Mostima:
You've done so much with the help of Penguin Logistics...

Mostima:
Wait, were you planning this from the very beginning?

Rat King:
Who knows?

Mostima:
Couldn't be. Your whole act is way too good. Or, at least it's better than mine.

Rat King:
Heh heh... you really are impressively clever.

Rat King:
The flames react to your will. Will you put me in the ground tonight?

Mostima:
How could I?

Mostima:
I respect my elders, and care for the young.

Exusiai:
Mostima!

Texas:
Woah, Exusiai! We're the ones who are surrounded. Don't break formation!

Exusiai:
Hold on! I'm coming!

Croissant:
They're all mixed in with the normal folk. This ain't no way to fight!

Bison:
What is going on...?

Croissant:
Bison, don't just sit there like a bump on a log. Yer in my way! Move it!

Bison:
They're all... it's all... how can I...?

Bison:
...I can't.

Bison:
All right. If that's how it has to be, we'll do it their way.

Bison:
Can you hear me?

Sora:
A message? For who?

Texas:
Careful.

Texas:
Focus, Sora.

Sora:
O- okay!

Bison:
You're here, aren't you? You always have been.

Butler:
Young Master... I...

Bison:
I don't blame you. I'm sure it was all my father's machinations. But right here, right now, I need you to help me.

Butler:
...Of course. Give me your instructions, Young Master.

Bison:
You really think this is a time for instructions?

Bison:
Just send them flying.

Butler:
To hear such an order from the mouth of the Young Master...

Butler:
Allow me to advocate for the Master of the House and ask: why?

Bison:
Who gives a shit why? Out of my way, Croissant!

Croissant:
Huh?

Croissant:
Ooh...

Bison:
Haaagh!

Croissant:
He- he knocked 'em into the air?!  That ain't how I do things!

Butler:
Hm... the Master of the House should be pleased with this result. But should the Young Master continue in this way... I worry he may find himself corrupted by Penguin Logistics.

Butler:
No... I mustn't obstruct the Young Master any further. If this is the course he believes is correct, then so be it.

Mafioso:
You little punk! I'll put you in the ground!

Bison:
——

Mafioso A:
He dodged?!

Mafioso B:
Yowch! Something knocked my club away!

Mafioso A:
Careful, they got a sniper!

Bison:
Outta my way!

Mostima:
...the intensity is under control, but you haven't moved a single step. Isn't that a little unreasonable?

Rat King:
When one stands unmoving, that does not mean one is relaxed.

Mostima:
Is there anything in Lungmen that can defeat you?

Rat King:
Yes. 'Lungmen' can.

Mostima:
Ooh, what a crafty answer.

Rat King:
I go to the park to exercise, every morning, without fail. It's important to stay active as I get older.

Mostima:
And are these morning exercises effective?

Rat King:
You have to add in a bit of life experience.

Mostima:
How are the two Siracusans?

Rat King:
How are they indeed.

Mostima:
...I really wonder how many of these invisible problems you quietly solve each and every day.

Mostima:
How many times have you tricked these people into massacring each other rather than let them dip their toes into Lungmen?

Rat King:
I don't recall. All I can tell you is that regardless of how many corpses piled up in the sewers, there are always far more people who strive to survive.

Bison:
Mostima! I'm here to——

Seemingly Ordinary Resident:
That's far enough. You guys, go help the Dai Lo.

Mafioso & Passerby:
Right!

Bison:
You won't get away with this.

Seemingly Ordinary Resident:
A sniper? The princeling's bodyguard?

Bison:
Outta my way!

Seemingly Ordinary Resident:
You're just a regular Messenger. You don't belong here.

Bison:
Messenger? That's right, I'm a Messenger. But the ladies behind me and in front of me, making all that noise? They're Messengers too.

Seemingly Ordinary Resident:
You're not like Texas and the others. You should leave this battle. Get yourself home safe.

Bison:
...you done?

Seemingly Ordinary Resident:
Nng——! You have some fight in you!

Mostima:
Just do it!

Bison:
Right!
