???:
So this time, he got a hole in his belly? Done in by that cool-looking old guy?

???:
That's right. I was in the front row. I saw the whole thing.

???:
What do you think it was? A body double? Special effects?

???:
No way. Couldn't be. Check out this video of it, you'll see...

???:
Woah. It's way too realistic!

???:
So was it Emperor's body double?

???:
What about last time? I remember when he was out shopping, some thugs ran up on him with a crossbow and got him right in the brain...

???:
You can't rehearse that ahead of time.

???:
And there was that time in Siesta, during the music festival. Lots of people after him there.

???:
I was there too, and I went out of my way to book a hotel right near by for a shot at seeing him. It was real exciting.

???:
...Isn't he a musician? I mean, he's got a bit of money, but how does he get this many people hating him?

???:
You don't know how he is. I'll say up front, I really like the guy. But when it comes to making enemies, he's got to be one of Terra's greatest experts.

???:
I heard there was some kind of accident at a Penguin Logistics warehouse last night. He came running out of the flames, completely unharmed.

???:
A while back, somebody saw him get hit dead on by like a grenade or explosive or something in the slums. He showed up totally fine in an underground bar the next day.

???:
That's nothing.

???:
Huh? His brains got blown out by an explosive shell.

???:
...You're sure it was an explosive?

???:
Speaking of which, during the most chaotic times in the history of Columbia's music industry it's said that he got taken out in a drive-by shooting, sparking a huge controversy.

???:
Didn't he get poisoned?

???:
Oh! I was on a trip to Columbia at the time... I thought I'd never get to see my idol ever again.

???:
But he lived?

???:
He lives, and he still goes to fight on his own. He says it's to avenge those kids.

???:
So? He can't die?

???:
It's got to be some fake news, right? You can't believe everything the media says.

???:
But boy is he hard to kill.

???:
I don't know. Maybe we should just tie him down in a crater and let a Catastrophe deal with him.

???:
...Why do I get the feeling he'd survive that one too?

???:
...Yeah, I can imagine him bursting out of the volcanic eruption, spewing curse words at it all the way.

???:
And they'd rhyme.

???:
......

???:
...Never mind.

???:
Afterall he is the one and only Emperor, am I right?
