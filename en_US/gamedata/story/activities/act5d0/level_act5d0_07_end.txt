Gambino:
*Pant* *pant...*

Capone:
Come on, Penguins!

Exusiai:
Looks like you two get along great?

Capone:
Grr!

Croissant:
What'd I ever do to you?! I'll clock you one!

Gambino:
Gah! Whose side are you on?!

Mafioso:
It- it wasn't me! It was that angel!

Exusiai:
Oopsie. I missed. Seems fine though.

Mafioso A:
Get 'em, while they're—— Agh! What are you choppin' at me for?!

Mafioso B:
Sorry, but I gotta stay loyal to the boss!

Mafioso A:
Me too!

Mafioso B:
Oh.

Gambino:
What are you doing on the ground? Get up and fight if you ain't dead!

Mafioso:
Y- yessir!

Exusiai:
You can't be so rough with your employees. Do they at least get hazard pay?

Texas:
It's kind of hard to tell who's who. Just try to get everyone wearing black on the ground.

Mostima:
Hoo yeah this is a mess.

Bison:
Sure is—— woah! Mostima?

Mostima:
But it looks like you're all doing okay.

Texas:
When did you get here?

Mostima:
The boss called me.

Capone:
Hey, it's that weird-lookin' Sankta.

Gambino:
Get outta here!

Gambino:
——

Mostima:
Somebody needs to calm down a bit.

Mostima:
What are you even fighting over here? Let's all take a step back.

Mafioso A:
She stopped the boss?!

Mafioso B:
No! It's that staff! Look out, boss! She's a caster!

Capone:
...Looks like we were right not to take her head on... Hey, don't get near 'em!

Gambino:
I ain't never seen a Sankta like you before. Or wait? Are you a Sarkaz? What the hell are you?

Mostima:
I'm just an ordinary Messenger.

Gambino:
Cazzata!

Gambino:
Grrr——

Mostima:
Time for an intermission... or are you not going to listen to me?

Gambino:
Who do you think you are?!

Mostima:
How are you all doing? It's been a long time, hasn't it?

Gambino:
Hey! Eyes over here!

Croissant:
A couple years, I think? Maybe a couple months?

Mafioso:
Gah!

Sora:
When your days are as rich and full as ours, you kinda lose track of time.

Exusiai:
It's been about four years and three months, Mostima.

Mostima:
Yeah, that's pretty long.

Exusiai:
——

Mostima:
Don't give me that face. If you keep looking that gloomy I'll think you've gotten sick.

Exusiai:
Isn't this a touching reunion?!

Mostima:
Touching or not, it's definitely not the time to be reminiscing.

Texas:
Are you really going to do it here?

Mostima:
I'll do only what needs doing.

Texas:
...Okay. Just go easy on them.

Mostima:
Don't worry.

Mostima:
And it looks like I've got another customer waiting.

Texas:
——?

Sora:
No matter how many times I see it, I'm always impressed how Mostima will wave her staff around all light and subtle, only to have some big amazing thing come out.

Croissant:
The mobsters're already scared stiff!

Exusiai:
Phew. I guess I should plug a couple of them?

Mostima:
What's wrong? Are we done?

Gambino:
You may have some moves, but you can bet I'm not lettin' you stroll outta here.

Mostima:
You don't always have to play the big bad wolf. Just treat this as some after dinner exercise—— Hm.

Mafioso:
Wh- what's going on? Did this fire just turn solid?

Mostima:
...seems like Yith is around here somewhere. We better wrap this up.

Gambino:
Who are you monologing at? Come at me!

Mostima:
You keep losing your temper. That's a really bad look for the head of a family. How are you going to keep control of the situation?

Gambino:
Grrr! This smug attitude of yours really pisses me off!

Mafioso:
Arts! Take cover!

Mafioso:
We'll take the Penguins. Don't wanna get in your way!

Texas:
They're underestimating us. Show them what we can do.

Croissant:
You got it! Yeeeeeeehaw!

Bison:
That's Mostima, the Messenger...

Bison:
A Messenger... are Messengers really all like this?

Bison:
...is that the wind?

Mostima:
...wind?

Mostima:
Texas! Run! Quick!

Texas:
...Right!

Mafioso:
Hey! What's with the earthquake?! What did that caster just do?

Mostima:
Honestly. Old people are so impatient.

Gambino:
You ain't gettin'——

Gambino:
Ack——

Capone:
Hey! It's Arts! Let's get outta here!

Gambino:
A sandstorm? Here?

Croissant:
Things're gettin' kinda weird.

Sora:
Texas! Over here!

Texas:
What about Bison and Mostima? Nng!

Exusiai:
The sandstorm cut them off. I'll get them!

Texas:
Wait, Exusiai!

Texas:
——

Texas:
Every time Mostima's involved, she loses control like this.

Bison:
Texas! Mostima! Where are you?!

Bison:
Gah... there's sand in my eyes——

Mostima:
Don't panic.

Bison:
Mostima!

Mostima:
Shield yourself from the sand and come with me.

Mostima:
...That's one old man we don't want to provoke within striking range.

Mafioso A:
The ground... I'm sinking...! It's quicksand! Run! Don't get swallowed up!

Mafioso B:
Boss! What do we do?!

Gambino:
Where are they? Where's Capone?!

Mafioso A:
They ran out under the cover of the sandstorm! We got a few of our guys in their crew...

Mafioso B:
Boss! This place is gonna collapse!

Gambino:
...Run. We'll get another shot.

Gambino:
Shit! What the hell happened?!

Rat King:
Another shot... hm...

Rat King:
Strange... I don't remember you having any shots left.
