00:38 A.M. \ Dusty

Downtown Lungmen, Plaza, Outdoor Party

Bison:
We followed the directions all the way but why is... is that a block party?

Exusiai:
Check out that candle! It's huge!

Texas:
Settle down, Exusiai.

Texas:
The air smells so sickly sweet, I feel like I want to puke.

Croissant:
Mmm... we oughta get ourselves a booth here next time. I bet we'd make a bundle!

Sora:
Texas, have you heard from the boss?

Texas:
Not yet. He's probably passed out drunk somewhere.

Texas:
Exusiai, can you get this thing off my head?

Exusiai:
Why!

Exusiai:
Thanks to this stupid light on my head, I don't get to wear big fun party hats like that. I'm so jealous!

Sora:
What happens if you try to force a hat on?

Exusiai:
I get a feeling that's something like waking up hungover to find I'm in the passenger seat of a car driven by a very emotionally charged Texas.

Croissant:
And that don't sound like a good time.

Sora:
So you've tried that before...

Exusiai:
So where's the boss?

Bison:
There's so many people here, if the enemy chases us this way, they'll get all mixed up with the civilians...

Jaye:
Ah.

Waai Fu:
It's Penguin Logistics.

Texas:
And you're... the girl from the detective agency...

Exusiai:
And this guy here with you is that infamous knife-wielding helmsman from the docks?

Jaye:
What? No. That's the craziest version I've heard yet...

Jaye:
I'm just a typical hawker. Oh! Tonight I'm a part-time finball master.

Waai Fu:
And you must be Texas?

Waai Fu:
Something happened tonight. Don't act like you don't know.

Jaye:
Waai Fu, you don't have to be so aggressive with them. They're just...

Waai Fu:
I know. But it's ridiculous how many times this has happened.

Waai Fu:
It's fine as long as you don't get anyone else mixed up in this.

Waai Fu:
But when it comes to getting innocent people hurt, causing so much damage to their property, can't you think like honest, law-abiding citizens for once?

Texas:
......

Bison:
(Nothin' we can say to that.)

Texas:
...So what?

Waai Fu:
So we must correct your deficient character.

Sora:
Th- there's no need to come to blows here. We know we've made a lot of trouble for a lot of people tonight, but we can talk this out.

Texas:
Sure.

Sora:
Texas?!

Texas:
Let me say this first: everything that's happened tonight is completely baffling and inexplicable, and also completely exhausting.

Texas:
So let's just say I'm not in a great mood right now.

Texas:
You hear what I'm saying?

Waai Fu:
One on one. If I win, you guys follow the rules to the letter.

Waai Fu:
...for at least one month.

Bison:
(Just a month?!)

Texas:
And if I win, then you and all your goldbricking busybodies have to mind your own damned business.

Waai Fu:
Fair's fair... But I won't go easy on you. Get ready!

Jaye:
Ugh. How did we come to this.

Bison:
Hold on! Both of you, calm down! You can't just have a fistfight in the middle of the...

Drunk:
Woah! Kung fu! Sick!

Drunk:
The wolf's not going down easy. C'mon! Look out behind you!

Drunk:
It's been a long time since I saw Yan kung fu this good! Show us some more!

Bison:
This isn't a show!

Sora:
Get her, Texas!

Exusiai:
Watch your leg! It's a feint!

Bison:
You don't have to join in!

Jaye:
Soda. Want some?

Croissant:
Oh. Thank ya kindly. But ain't ya gonna try to stop this little kerfuffle?

Jaye:
I can't stop it. Looks like you know that already.

Bison:
So we just watch?

Jaye:
Or I guess we could cheer them on?

Broadcast:
*crackle*

Bison:
What's that?

Broadcast:
Attention! All good citizens attending the Sauin celebration!

Drunk:
What?

Drunk:
What's up? What's that guy doing?

Broadcast:
Can you hear me?

Drunk:
Hey! You're too loud!

Broadcast:
Aight. Great. You can hear me.

Broadcast:
Now, everybody, quiet down! Quiet down please!

Broadcast:
Lend me your ears. And bow before me.

Drunk:
What's this guy's deal?

Drunk:
Wait a minute, that's Emperor! From Monster Siren Records! C'mon!

Drunk:
Shouldn't he be in Columbia?! What's he doing in Lungmen?

Bison:
What is Mr. Emperor... doing?

Exusiai:
The boss always does this music producer thing.

Sora:
I mean, he is a music producer.

Croissant:
Our operating capital ain't just from the logistics business. The baws's got all kinds of revenue streams. Like...

Bison:
Like what?

Croissant:
Nah. Never mind. Prob'ly best not to say too much.

Texas:
Grr!

Waai Fu:
What's the matter? You're slowing down.

Texas:
Look how the people are moving around us. It's too regimented. Something's not right.

Waai Fu:
Don't make excuses!

Drunk:
EM! PER! OR!

Drunk:
EM! PER! OR!

Emperor:
......

???:
...how noisy.

Rat King:
Today is Sauin, Mr. Emperor, but your dreadful 'music' is loud enough to wake the dead.

Emperor:
Say what?!

Emperor:
You... when did... how'd you get behind me...?

Rat King:
Good night, Mr. Emperor. And a happy Sauin to you.

Emperor:
...ugly ass rat, you better... remember...

Drunk:
What just happened? Is this some kind of play...?

Drunk:
Did he just stab Emperor? Is he dead?!

Texas:
Hya!

Waai Fu:
Hai-ya!

Drunk:
Urk...!

Jaye:
Hey, Waai Fu, you hit the wrong...

Texas:
No. She didn't.

Texas:
We're surrounded.

Drunk:
......

Exusiai:
Um... Did they follow us all the way from the slums?

Croissant:
All these fellers here, they're all on the same team?

Sora:
No way. So many...

Bison:
They're all here for us. It was a trap. And Mr. Emperor...

Bison:
*Gasp!*

Rat King:
Is this thing on...? Ahem, hello? Testing? People of Lungmen, good evening.

Rat King:
Please do not panic. This dead fellow here is but an insignificant penguin. The Sauin celebrations will proceed as planned. Naturally, some professionals will be here shortly to remove this bothersome corpse.

Rat King:
Now I know this is quite sudden, and I apologize for the interruption, but I thought I would add one more special program to tonight's Carnival.

Rat King:
Our friends from Siracusa have brought us a very special gift. It is hidden somewhere here in this very Carnival.

Rat King:
Time grows short, my friends.

Bison:
(Is he watching me? No, wait, that old man...)

Rat King:
It will be terrible if no one finds this precious treasure.

Rat King:
The very last surprise of your lives.
