Mafioso:
Boss, Penguin Logistics is on the move.

Gambino:
Of course. I just gave her a few skin deep cuts...

Gambino:
But I'm more worried about Capone.

Mafioso:
Y- yeah, we haven't been able to reach him. Tried real hard an hour ago.

Gambino:
Where's the last place you got him? The slums?

Mafioso:
Er, yeah.

Gambino:
That's too bad.

Mafioso:
What do you mean?

Gambino:
Tell all the crews, we're going with the original plan to get Penguin Logistics...

Gambino:
But I'm thinkin'... unless something goes wrong, we'll get two or three crews dropping off the grid.

Mafioso:
What do you mean... boss?

Mafioso:
Couldn't be... Capone betrayed the Family?

Gambino:
I get where he's comin' from. All too well.

Gambino:
We grew up together. And dad had us deal with a traitor, with our own two hands. That was my first time takin' a life. Our first time takin' a life.

Gambino:
The Siracusa fiasco changed us. The only difference is he turned weak, and I chose the clear path.

Gambino:
He's gonna sell out the Family. Or I guess he wants to give the Family a new name.

Mafioso:
So what should we do about it?

Gambino:
Penguin Logistics is turning out trickier than I thought. And we can't fight a war on too many fronts.

Gambino:
I'm thinkin' we deal with our traitor problem first.

Mafioso A:
I'm down at the intersection. Nothing special here.

Mafioso B:
Roger. Proceed as usual.

Mafioso A:
W- wait! What's the plan here?

Mafioso B:
Huh? You screwed up something?

Mafioso A:
No, I just wanna be sure. I really don't know Lungmen at all.

Mafioso B:
It's Sauin. When midnight rolls around, Lungmen kicks off a huge Carnival. The whole town turns out. That's when we rub out Penguin Logistics. Bada bing!

Mafioso A:
Now about the boss...

Mafioso B:
Don't ask too many questions. Just do what you're told. Chop-chop.

Mafioso:
...it's what it is.

Mafioso:
You ain't gonna kill me, are you?

Exusiai:
Of course not. But you gotta take a nap for me like a good boy~

Exusiai:
Texas, you copy?

Texas:
It's the same over here. They all split off into little groups.

Texas:
But their leader was in the fight himself, which means they've got someone else handing out dispatch orders.

Texas:
We just have to cut off that head.

Sora:
Hey~ Texas?

Sora:
We're in the city center, but boy are there a lot of people out here.

Texas:
Watch for the enemy. They're moving in small teams.

Sora:
I know~ We'll make sure our friends on the street keep an eye out... Wait, boss? You want to get up on a float? Erm, wait for me...

Texas:
Croissant, Bison, do you copy?

Bison:
So you were talking about that someone else giving dispatch orders, we ran into a little surprise over here.

Croissant:
Bison, get down. Take cover behind that box over there. Don't get yerself seen.

Bison:
Right. I'll call you back, Texas.

Mafioso A:
So where do we go from here?

Mafioso B:
I dunno. Since we cut off the boss... since we cut off Gambino Ricci, we really don't have a choice.

Mafioso A:
Sigh.

Mafioso B:
What's to sigh about? Mr. Capone did so much for us here in Lungmen, and what came of it?

Mafioso B:
Gambino hops on over from Siracusa and makes nothin' but trouble. Not a lick of good's come of him!

Mafioso B:
If we kept to Mr. Capone's plan from the start, we wouldn't be in this mess.

Mafioso B:
We've been over this with the Rat King. Why do we gotta kill anybody? This ain't Siracusa!

Mafioso A:
The boss, I mean the old boss, he's probably just blowin' off steam.

Mafioso B:
Well he needs to grow up.

Croissant:
(Sounds like trouble in paradise.)

Bison:
(Sure does. This could be good for us, if we...)

Mafioso A:
Hey! Who's there?!

Croissant:
Huh? A gunshot?

Bison:
It's that sniper again! We're exposed!

Mafioso B:
It's the Penguins! Don't let 'em get away!

Butler:
...Do forgive me, Young Master. This is what the Master of the House has demanded of me.

Butler:
But in taking action upon the Young Master, I have placed him in danger...

Butler:
When this matter is concluded, I believe it may be time to retire to the countryside.

Butler:
Sigh.

Texas:
...Sounds like they're in trouble.

Texas:
Exusiai, once you've marked out the gangsters' route, move to meet up with Croissant.

Exusiai:
You got it~

Texas:
Sora.

Sora:
Whew... the bad guys are making a lot of moves, but it looks like they're splitting into two teams. Might be a trap...

Yith:
It is not so complicated. The enemy is suffering from internal strife. This is an opportunity.

Sora:
Aaaie! You scared me!

Texas:
...Welcome back.

Texas:
Why'd you have to hack into our private channel? Couldn't you just send us a normal message?

Yith:
This was quicker.

Sora:
Where are you now?

Yith:
A depressing cafe. I suddenly remembered I was supposed to have today off, so I came out to enjoy the nightlife.

Yith:
I've sent you Croissant and the new boy's coordinates. Lungmen's network speeds are remarkably satisfactory.

Texas:
...understood. Once we've finished our respective missions, we'll move to assist them.

Texas:
This is our chance to strike back.

Mafioso:
Mr. Capone, the boss's hit on Penguin Logistics looks like it failed.

Capone:
What's that meathead worth? I don't even wanna hear his name.

Mafioso:
...Is that how we do it?

Capone:
The Family needs a solid foundation. The name is the least important part.

Capone:
Did you find the Rat King yet?

Mafioso:
Not yet. He really don't leave any tracks around...

Capone:
We gotta be patient. He's like a part of the city. He's Lungmen's shadow. It ain't like we got much time though.

Mafioso:
But we gotta be careful. If the Rat King picks up on what we're doin', we could find ourselves fighting three sides at once.

Capone:
It's the same for everyone. If we're locked into a tough spot, the best thing to do is stir up some chaos.

Capone:
You got news of Gambino?

Mafioso:
......

Capone:
You deaf?

Gambino:
If you got somethin' to say to me, shouldn't you just say it to my face?

Capone:
How did you get in here?

Gambino:
Not everybody's like you. Not everybody can just up and turn their back on an oath made before dad's grave.

Capone:
Oath? That's just because we were walking the same path. But times have changed, Gambino.

Gambino:
You broke my heart, Capone. But I'll give you one last chance to explain yourself, as my brother.

Capone:
Hmph. Seven years ago, when we buried the old boss, you sent me here, to Lungmen.

Capone:
I came halfway across the world to set up a business that could support the Family, like a backstop.

Capone:
But then you had to go and screw up in Siracusa. And what do you do? You hop on over here and take over everything I broke my back to build.

Gambino:
Come on, you ain't gettin' pissed off over some little shit like this. Or you'd've been dead a long time ago.

Capone:
Say what you want. But today I learned the sharpest fangs in the Family's what's gonna turn around and kill it.

Gambino:
So you gonna pull out your fangs and snap a collar on yourself? Hah!

Capone:
If you keep runnin' around Lungmen makin' noise like you do, sooner or later the powers that be are gonna get sick of it and wipe us out.

Gambino:
Your deep and heartfelt concern for the Family is moving me to tears, dear Capone.

Capone:
The feeling's mutual.

Gambino:
You're rusty.

Capone:
The scars you got in Siracusa are holding you back too.

Gambino:
Just give up. I don't wanna kill you.

Capone:
No, you really do.

Gambino:
Heh. You know me too well.

Capone:
Wh——

Croissant:
Well lookie here! I just wanted to bust through this wall and make a nice path... but it looks like I found quite a sight.

Croissant:
Sorry to bother ya. You two keep at it. We'll go around.

Mafioso:
Hurry! Don't let them get away!

Bison:
...I think we're out of options.

Gambino:
How about that. Our troublemakers came right to us. We'll just scoop you up and——

Gambino:
What is it this time?!

Exusiai:
Heyy~ We're heere!

Texas:
What a coincidence, running into everyone.

Sora:
So, is it time for a final battle already? Seems a little early?

Texas:
It's fine. The sooner we get this whole thing over with, the better.

Texas:
Just throw them in the river, like the boss said.

Capone:
This kind of chaos is just the way I like it.

Capone:
Tonight's big winner is the one who walks out of here alive.
