Croissant:
*Cough cough* Everybody okay?

Bison:
Just managed to block it——

Texas:
Nice reflexes, you two.

Exusiai:
Whew, they really blew it up, didn't they?

Emperor:
————*indescribable penguin sounds*————

Croissant:
(Wh- what's that? Baws's makin' all kinds of crazy sounds!)

Exusiai:
(Hey, wasn't that box of vinyl records some kind of black market Columbian collectible thingy?)

Croissant:
(I reckon yer right. What're we gonna do? I ain't never seen the baws all choked up like this before...)

Exusiai:
What do you mean—— Hey! They're getting away! Those guys in black!

Bison:
Wait! If they were here setting that trap, why didn't they just ambush us? This isn't adding up. We need to take a minute and come up with a plan before——

Exusiai:
Texas!

Texas:
Get in.

Emperor:
...Listen up.

Emperor:
You can expense your speeding tickets tonight.

Emperor:
They gotta pay... for my vinyl recoooords!!!

Croissant:
Got 'em! Dead ahead!

Emperor:
Exusiai! Pass me my Lil Homie!

Exusiai:
You got it, boss!

Bison:
Is that a gun?! But how are you going to pull the trigger...?

Emperor:
Hah! See for yourself, little man. Let our firearms expert tell you about it.

Exusiai:
That's forty-two layers of logistics-grade cardboard, seamlessly glued together with industrial adhesive, driven by the finest rubber bands. It's really a magnificent piece.

Bison:
You mean... it's a toy?

Exusiai:
It's more of a slingshot——Ow! Err, it's a peacemaker!

Emperor:
You can't use live ammo in downtown Lungmen. That's the law.

Texas:
And yet this is the only time the boss seems to care what the law says.

Emperor:
If nobody follows the rules, our whole society goes to hell, you feel me? Texas, put the top down!

Texas:
Be careful. Don't want you hitting your head on a traffic signal like last time.

Emperor:
Do I look that tall to you?

Exusiai:
Support sniper in position, boss!

Bison:
W- wait a minute, there's a lot of other cars on the road. Don't tell me you're just gonna——

Mafia Driver:
They're shootin' at us! Return fire!

Back Seat Mafioso:
How am I supposed to aim with you swervin' all over the place?!

Mafia Driver:
Hey, are you hit back there?!

Back Seat Mafioso:
I'm bleeding, they got me, I need a bandage—— No wait, what is this, rubber?

Mafia Driver:
A what?!

Back Seat Mafioso:
It's rubber, but it broke the glass! Shake 'em off, quick! Gah, that hurt!!

Exusiai:
Clean headshot, boss!

Emperor:
Sic 'em, Texas!

Texas:
I'm speeding up.

Bison:
Slow down! Watch out for that big rig—— Aie!

Croissant:
Yer gonna wanna hold on tight. Texas's whipped up wilder'n a Forte in a twister right now.

Emperor:
Exu, blow their tires!

Exusiai:
On it!

Bison:
She's gonna pop their tires with rubber bullets?!

Emperor:
I have spoken. So let it be done.

Bison:
Texas, can you talk some sense into them?!

Texas:
(Looks away) ......

Croissant:
Forget it. They're havin' a good time.

Exusiai:
Check this out! It's gonna do a cool flip!

Mafia Driver:
Hey, I can't move the steering wheel!

Back Seat Mafioso:
Shit, bail out!

Bison:
Wait! Going this fast, we're gonna get pulled in!

Exusiai:
Hah.

Exusiai:
All right, now the multi-car pileup is all yours, Texas!

Texas:
Gee, thanks a lot.
