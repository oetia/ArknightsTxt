Lungmen, Sunset Boulevard, a certain bar, the last unwiped table near the back

Capone:
Jack of Spades. Straight flush. I win again, Gambino.

Gambino:
You win again. But you deal slower than I do with my toes.

Capone:
You backin' out again?

Gambino:
Shut up.

Capone:
Shut up? Wish you knew how to shut up last night. Coulda saved us a lotta trouble.

Gambino:
You been in Lungmen a long time, Capone. Maybe you need a reminder in how you talk to me, the boss.

Capone:
Sit down, you moron. It's thanks to that temper of yours that business in Siracusa's so lousy.

Gambino:
You been here seven or eight years, and what've you done besides learn some Lungmen swearings? You stood here and watched our channels dry up?

Capone:
I'm the one who got us a supporter last night. Try as you did to cock it up.

Capone:
And besides, here in Lungmen, you and me are equals, 'boss.'

Gambino:
The way this Rat King runs the show here, ain't it just the old worn out Siracusan tricks?

Capone:
If only you could play a good Siracusan hand worth a damn.

Gambino:
Too bad you're the worst card in it.

Capone:
We got a role to play in Lungmen. Think about it: we got a tired, broken down city with a rich underworld. It could be a new home for the Family.

Gambino:
Only Siracusa can truly respect us, Capone. Don't forget the shame of being driven out of our home with our tails between our legs.

Capone:
You can't eat honor.

Gambino:
Hmph.

Capone:
Wei Yenwu set some rules for this city. As long as we don't break 'em, we can run our rackets here just like before. Lungmen needs a little 'legitimate business.'

Gambino:
...I ain't seen you in years and I'm already gettin' sick of you.

Capone:
Same same, boss.

Gambino:
You...!

???:
Can you not have your noisy lovers' quarrel in here? This lousy champagne's doin' enough to piss me off. Grab a bottle and take it outside, aight?

Gambino:
Get outta here. This don't concern you.

???:
Watch your tone. I'm the boss in here.

???:
We got a one-stop funeral service, if you're interested. 20% off if you both die together.

Capone:
Hey... ain't this guy...?

Gambino:
...This is what we get since we left Siracusa. Nobody knows you're Sicilian.

???:
Who gives a shit who you are?

Gambino:
Yo, Capone, do me a favor and torch this tacky joint. Call it 'urban beautification.' Wei Yenwu'll thank us for tearin' down a tastelessly decorated rathole.

Capone:
Quiet! Don't provoke him!

???:
Oh?

Emperor:
Who you callin' 'tasteless?'
