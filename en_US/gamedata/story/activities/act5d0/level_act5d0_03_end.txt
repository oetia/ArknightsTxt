Jaye:
Phew... It's getting late. Time to go home and sleep...

Jaye:
This is a great place to run a seafood stand. I can't believe how many customers came through. Hm? Is that...?

Waai Fu:
......

Jaye:
Hey.

Waai Fu:
I'll break this arm if I have to.

Jaye:
It's me, it's me! Let go!

Waai Fu:
Huh? What are you doing here?

Jaye:
I just closed up. I'm on my way home.

Jaye:
You're the one who's here spacing out—— Well, I guess it's not spacing out if you can flip around and snap my neck like that...

Waai Fu:
Did you hear that car accident just now, up on the overpass?

Jaye:
...aren't you supposed to be studying?

Waai Fu:
One must strike a balance between recreation and labor. If I spent the whole night before the exam cramming, I'd go in there with my brain totally fried.

Jaye:
Yeah, sure.

Jaye:
I heard some customers talking about it. I hope nobody died.

Waai Fu:
Same... but I heard something at the office. I guess there's some real unsavory characters mixed up in this...

Jaye:
Let's get this out of the way: I have nothing to do with any killers, gangs, or anyone in that world. You know that, right?

Waai Fu:
Everybody knows your deal—— Or maybe I should just say, with this attitude of yours, it's natural to be a little suspicious?

Jaye:
...right. I get it.

Waai Fu:
And there was a gas explosion on a highway in the outskirts just two hours ago.

Waai Fu:
A gas explosion on a highway? That's a pretty convenient explanation.

Jaye:
Hey, you're not thinking...?

Waai Fu:
I told you: one must strike a balance between recreation and labor.

Jaye:
...right. I get it.

Jaye:
So is this recreation or labor?

Mostima:
There we go. They can't do anything downtown like this. Too many people.

Mostima:
You ordered the matcha, right? This one's yours. My treat.

Bison:
I don't see any mafia-looking guys, but... aren't we letting our guard down a bit too much?

Mostima:
What are you talking about? This place is a FIVE STAR recommendation. That's way more awesome than some mobsters.

Mostima:
You been able to contact Texas and them yet?

Bison:
No, it was so fast...

Mostima:
So what's to be all nervous about?

Bison:
......

Mostima:
Your ice cream's melting. You gotta calm down already.

Bison:
Er, it's just... nobody could have predicted this. I should calm down.

Mostima:
These mobsters came aaall the way from Siracusa to Lungmen. We can bet they're not here for Sauin, right?

Bison:
...They definitely have some other goal. One of them is me, but beyond that, I don't know.

Bison:
We're in a good position. We managed to lose them. And with just the two of us versus however many of them, we have the advantage in scouting them out...

Bison:
But how do we proceed? Should we start hunting them? No, the better move is to reconnect with Texas...

Mostima:
Heh. You seem a lot more like an ordinary Messenger than Texas and the girls.

Bison:
Oh, sorry, was I talking to myself?

Mostima:
No, you're right.

Mostima:
We know the mob is up to something, we can't just go off half cocked.

Mostima:
But sometimes you gotta trust in the girls. I know they can be a little out there, but Penguin Logistics is a tough cookie.

Mostima:
It's kind of weird to call a logistics firm 'tough,' but... Forget it. It's not like I've got any room to complain.

Mostima:
Let's just take a walk, enjoy the scenery. And maybe by the time we run into Texas and the crew, they'll have this whole gang war all wrapped up?

Bison:
...erm, really?

Mostima:
Ah...

Bison:
Mostima?

Mostima:
You see that candy store?

Bison:
It's really more of a stall than a store.

Mostima:
Hm, it is pretty old.

Mostima:
I came here on a trip to Lungmen years ago.

Mostima:
Back then... I didn't have any Lungmen dollars on me. Honestly, I must've looked a sight. But still, I found myself drawn to the candy.

Bison:
O... kay.

Mostima:
That's what a Messenger does. We get into trouble on our long and arduous journeys.

Mostima:
C'mon, let's take a look.

Bison:
......

Little Girl:
Wow! It's a twinkly star!

Little Girl:
Mister, how did you pull a star down here?

Old Man:
Sorry, but that's a secret I'll have to keep.

Little Boy:
That's not a star! It's just a candy with some food coloring!

Little Girl:
But I've never seen such a pretty candy before... you sure you don't want one?

Little Boy:
Y- you're such a pain! Don't they have any cotton candy?

Old Man:
Of course we do. Here, give me your hand.

Little Girl:
Oh... but I don't want cotton candy. I want that one...

Little Boy:
I hate fruity candies! They're too sweet! And they turn your tongue weird colors!

Old Man:
Just take what you want. No charge. For Sauin.

Old Man:
Now it's getting late. You kids hurry home and get to bed!

Little Girl:
Thanks, mister!

Little Boy:
Hurry up! I wanna go to the toy store and check out the limited Sauin knights they got!

Old Man:
Kids these days have so much energy.

Old Man:
Did you want something? We've got these lovely Victorian gumdrops. Real imports. And they come with a candle for Sauin.

Mostima:
Hmm...

Mostima:
We're in no hurry. The night is young.

Old Man:
Ho ho. And so are you. You two must be here for the downtown Carnival.

Bison:
(Mostima, who is this guy...?)

Mostima:
...you enjoy the nightlife, sir?

Old Man:
Not with these old bones I don't. But the candy I sell tends to make its way there for me.

Mostima:
Is there something special about this year's Carnival Gala? Looks like a lot of foreign guests in town.

Old Man:
Things have been quiet in this town for too many years. The people are definitely itching for the Carnival.

Old Man:
The Carnival brings in all kinds of characters showing up getting into all kinds of trouble. And that's pretty fun, isn't it?

Mostima:
Yeah, for sure.

Old Man:
The point of Sauin was always to see off the souls of the departed. If the living are having a good time, that's a decent sacrifice.

Old Man:
You really don't want anything? Last time, you stood outside with your face stuck to the display window. I thought I was gonna have to peel you off.

Mostima:
Wow, you remember me? That's kind of embarrassing.

Old Man:
Hah. How could I forget?

Mostima:
I'd love to. But I really can't be eating too many sweets before work.

Old Man:
That's too bad... Ah well, have a good evening, kids.

Old Man:
Do come again, when you have time.

Mostima:
Yeah. Of course.

Bison:
......

Mostima:
The Carnival, huh? I heard it's the biggest festival event for Lungmen in years.

Mostima:
......Bison?

Bison:
Sorry, I just had something on my mind...

Mostima:
It's pretty obvious what you'd be thinking about at a time like this.

Mostima:
But boy do you love thinking too much. Just go with your gut sometimes.

Bison:
My gut... even a Messenger like you says to trust your gut?

Mostima:
You play it case by case. Like right now we're up here on a bridge, and there's a cargo ship passing down below us.

Bison:
Okay?

Mostima:
And we got three disguised mobsters coming at us from both directions.

Bison:
Wha!

Mostima:
It's too late now. They've been watching us for a while.

Mostima:
Since the candy store.

Bison:
We- we're surrounded?

Mostima:
There's tourists all around us, so we can't fight.

Mostima:
But I'm not sure these guys have any hangups about that.

Bison:
...so what do we do?

Mostima:
Jump.

Bison:
I'm sorry?

Mostima:
Jump. Now.

Bison:
Off the bridge——?

Mostima:
There you go with that thinking again. Hop over the railing. Take a leap of faith. Like so——!

Bison:
W- wait a sec——

Bison:
Welp! Somehow I feel like this isn't my first time in freefall....

Bison:
It's... candy? Why is this freighter hauling candy?

Bison:
But at least it looks like we lost them, Mostima——

Bison:
......

Bison:
Mostima?
