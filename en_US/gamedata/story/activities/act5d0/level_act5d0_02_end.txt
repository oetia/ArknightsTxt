Lungmen Central Park, Finball Stand

Jaye:
Your finballs.

Female Tourist:
Oooh, such springy mouthfeel. Pretty good.

Female Tourist:
This place definitely earned that recommendation in the Great Foodie Guide!

Jaye:
Glad you like it.

Male Tourist:
......

Male Tourist:
...That finball guy kinda gives me the creeps.

Female Tourist:
I know what you mean. Like, you're selling finballs, why do you have a big knife on the counter there?

Male Tourist:
The Foodie Guide says the owner is an old man called 'The Godly Finball Uncle.'

Male Tourist:
He couldn't be some kind of triad or something...

Jaye:
Hm? Did you want something else?

Female Tourist:
Oh, no.

Jaye:
...customers have been so weird lately.

???:
I'm sure it's got nothing to do with that 'Resting Triad Face' you've got going on.

Waai Fu:
And this is what you wear to work? Think about how this makes Uncle Tung look.

Jaye:
Welcome back. Done with work?

Waai Fu:
You could say that. The office said you took some credit. How much?

Jaye:
32.60, rounded. You want to try one?

Waai Fu:
Where'd that come from? I don't have any change on me.

Jaye:
Consider it a token of my appreciation for doing so much to look after my business.

Waai Fu:
All right. Don't mind if I do.

Waai Fu:
Hmm...

Waai Fu:
It's tasty and all, but isn't this Uncle Tung's stall? A tribute made with borrowed goods is one without meaning.

Jaye:
You always have to get your digs in. This one's on me...

Waai Fu:
Okay then. You've definitely gotten better. I wish the other punks took things as seriously as you do.

???:
Evening. I'll take some finballs.

Jaye:
Coming right up.

???:
Take your time. I'm just enjoying the view of the river. Usually don't see it from this far away.

???:
Smells nice. The Great Foodie Guide never gets it wrong.

Waai Fu:
......

Jaye:
...order up. Here's your change.

???:
Thanks.

Jaye:
Please come again.

Jaye:
Waai Fu? What are you looking at?

Waai Fu:
It's just that girl kinda weirded me out... do Sankta grow horns?

Jaye:
Must be some Sauin makeup or something.

Waai Fu:
They looked real. Whatever. Idle gossip is an unbecoming habit.

Jaye:
What's next on the agenda? Back to the office?

Waai Fu:
Studying. I've got a test in two days.

Jaye:
You're spending Sauin studying?

Waai Fu:
Sauin is supposed to be about shepherding spirits into the afterlife. Our society has totally corrupted it with consumerism. Respectfully, I will abstain.

Waai Fu:
Not to mention, I don't get paid that much. I need to get my grades up and nab a scholarship.

Jaye:
Yeah, that sounds about right for you...

Waai Fu:
It's their fault for being so out of touch. Don't lump me in with them.

???:
Hm, I've still got some time. Where should I go next? Let's see, looks like there's some good eats around here...

Curious Lungmenite:
Woah! What's happening up on the overpass? A car crash?

Strolling Lungmenite:
Doesn't seem like a regular crash. Let's go check it out.

Easygoing Lungmenite:
Another street fight? Count me in!

Mafioso:
Friggin psychos, get away from meee!

???:
Oh... so soon?

???:
Looks like I'm on the clock already.

Bison:
Ow... I was thrown clear...?

Mafioso A:
Thank heaven for guard rails. Otherwise we'd be a puddle down there.

Mafioso B:
Hurry up! Pull me out!

Bison:
They're trying to get away! Stay on them!

Exusiai:
Mmmff! This... airbag... it's smooshing me!

Emperor:
Hold still! You're gonna crush my Lil Homie! Yo! Croissant! It's comin' outta your pay!

Croissant:
It ain't me! I can't move at all with Texas on top of me!

Texas:
Oof.

Bison:
Then I guess it's up to me——!

Exusiai:
Bison! Wait!

Bison:
Everyone's crowding around. If they get away now we'll never catch them!

Mafioso B:
Pull me out already! That Forte kid's coming!

Mafioso A:
I'm trying!

Bison:
Don't move!

Bison:
So... heavy...

Bison:
Who——

Croissant:
A sniper?!

Emperor:
Yo, Texas.

Texas:
On it.

Bison:
(They missed. Bad shot?)

Bison:
(No, they're trying to hit the fuel tank——!)

Mafioso A:
Huh, what's going on? Who's shooting at the Forte kid?

Mafioso B:
Focus! The wolf's on her way too! Pull me out already!

Mafioso B:
Wait, what's that smell? It's fuel! Hurry!!

Mafioso A:
Brother... it's what it is.

Mafioso B:
You son of a——!

Bison:
Damn! I can't——

Texas:
Ugh. Too late.
