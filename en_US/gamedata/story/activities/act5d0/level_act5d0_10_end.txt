Jaye:
We're just... going to watch?

Waai Fu:
We're just going to watch. But I have no idea what's happening.

Jaye:
At least they're not hurting any civilians?

Jaye:
And there's so much good food going to waste...

Waai Fu:
I hate to see it too. But I guess a street fight is just part of the party.

Jaye:
It was planned?

Waai Fu:
Doesn't look like it. Oh, someone's coming.

Jaye:
Hm?

Mafioso:
Agh...! I think... I hit the wrong person...

Jaye:
Isn't it kind of unsafe to stay here?

Waai Fu:
I could go back to the office, but what would I even do there?

Jaye:
Don't you have a test tomorrow? In the afternoon?

Waai Fu:
......

Waai Fu:
......Crap.

Yith:
Those two seem as if they are uninvolved in this event.

Yith:
We should ask them to leave. We would not want them to get hurt.

???:
...Hold on, isn't that man up there with his belly cut open the Emperor of Penguin Logistics?

???:
He's dead. And you seem not at all bothered?

Yith:
Bothered? Why?

Yith:
Mr. Emperor gets himself into such trouble several times a month. We have grown accustomed to this behavior.

???:
His death?

Yith:
Correct.

???:
...Sounds like Mostima really shouldn't be getting close to you people.

Yith:
You worry about her?

???:
I'm just here to make sure she doesn't do anything out of line.

???:
But, hm, it's a really clumsy act. Since she looks so relaxed over there, I guess there isn't anything worth worrying about.

???:
I'm going for a walk. Don't tell her I came. I'll go see her myself when things quiet down.

Yith:
...There she goes.

Yith:
She shows up, asks her questions, and leaves just as suddenly as she appears.

Yith:
Is this the way they do things in Laterano now?

Rat King:
...Heh. I suddenly find myself envious of you young people.

Rat King:
You always choose your own paths, thinking only of yourselves. You don't consider your places in the grand scheme of things.

Mostima:
I also work hard.

Rat King:
But no one has ever been able to get to the bottom of you.

Mostima:
If you ever really did, that would be the most frustrating of all.

Rat King:
Indeed. There are some things that should not be so thoroughly investigated. Especially those things that have to do with Mostima the Messenger.

Mostima:
What is this? Occupational discrimination?

Rat King:
I'm only speaking from experience.

Rat King:
Let's take a break for a moment now.

Mostima:
Huh.

Mostima:
My Arts are suppressed...?

Mostima:
So you were the one holding back your strength all this time?

Rat King:
As were you.

Rat King:
But you have wasted enough time.

Seemingly Ordinary Resident:
This little punk, how can he keep fighting...? Grr...

Bison:
*Pant pant* I can... keep going... all night...

Mostima:
Yep. You're doing great.

Mostima:
Good thing you were able to deal with so many bad guys so quickly.

Exusiai:
Hey. We won't let you disappear on your own this time.

Exusiai:
So this guy's the evil mastermind pulling the strings here? I definitely owe him a personal beating!

Croissant:
We got ourselves one helluva workout today. And the bill's gettin' mighty long too.

Croissant:
Texas, I'm thinkin' there's a lot we ain't gonna get to expense here tonight...

Texas:
Don't ask me. That's a question for the boss.

Sora:
But the boss is dead...

Texas:
...Then it'll have to wait.

Sora:
Speaking of, did anybody go deal with the boss's corpse? Leaving him up there to get trampled feels kind of...

Rat King:
There we are. The players are assembled.

Rat King:
...Young people always make their own choices.

Rat King:
Even if it means walking through a Catastrophe, leaving your bodies splattered and broken, you still proceed with such determination.

Exusiai:
What is he talking about?

Mostima:
Just a grandpa's muttering. Don't worry about it.

Rat King:
Right then. Are you enjoying your Sauin?

Croissant:
S'all right. Kinda like a hangover. No way I can think about what I gotta do tomorrow.

Sora:
So... nobody's going to take care of the boss?

Rat King:
...Penguin Logistics, you truly are unfathomable.

Mostima:
I think we don't need to worry about that, considering.

Mostima:
It's Penguin Logistics. The whole reason for this war was someone questioning the boss's tastes.

Bison:
I'm sorry, what?

Mostima:
He gave his life to preserve his style. That's our Emperor.

Rat King:
But I must say, not one of you ever surprised me in the slightest.

Exusiai:
Mmmff! What's this sand?!

Sora:
He still has the strength?

Texas:
Yes... everybody focus. This fight is going to be different.

Texas:
If you let your guard down for even a split second,

Texas:
You'll die.

Rat King:
Sauin must be a lively event!

Rat King:
Let me see with my own eyes the freaks that Emperor raised.

Texas:
——

Texas:
My blade broke the moment it touched the sand... that's a problem.

Rat King:
Mmm. In all my years, those bold enough to approach me with blade or bullet were few and far between.

Exusiai:
I'll give him one of these!

Exusiai:
Oof, no good! Croissant, you're up!

Croissant:
My hammer's already stuck in the quicksand! I can't move!

Rat King:
Hopeless. Is this all you have, Penguin Logistics?

Mostima:
That's not all.

Rat King:
...Hm?

Mostima:
His sand shield is broken. Now, Exusiai!

Exusiai:
It's barrage time!

Rat King:
How many guns do you have? Troublesome angel.

Bison:
Don't even think about it!

Rat King:
Oh? I've been blocked?

Exusiai:
Thanks, Bison!

Croissant:
I'm up! Sorry fer the elder abuse!

Croissant:
Aagh! Couldn't get him! Texas, yer up!

Rat King:
Wishful thinking.

Sora:
I got this, Texas!

Rat King:
Hmm, a voice-based Originium Art. What an interesting little girl.

Texas:
How's your spatial awareness?

Rat King:
...Hm.

Rat King:
......

Texas:
He even dodged from that angle...

Bison:
At least you made him move. When he takes us on just standing in one place, I feel like he's looking down on us.

Rat King:
...Oh, Penguin Logistics.

Rat King:
That coat was a gift from my daughter.

Rat King:
In all these years, you are the first to even touch it.

Rat King:
How many young people like you are in Lungmen? What are you capable of, actually?

Mostima:
It's enough to just be yourself, isn't it? Or are you upset?

Rat King:
No, I just find myself with some... complex feelings...

Rat King:
But it's getting terribly late now, so it's time I——

Rat King:
Mmng?!

Sora:
He- he's been shot?

Texas:
It's that sniper from before. He's still here.

Butler:
...Target down. Moving to confirm.

Bison:
What have you done?!

Butler:
Young Master, he was a threat.

Butler:
You should never have gone so close to him. He has an affinity for Originium Arts. I could not guarantee your safety.

Butler:
You must understand, the Young Master's safety is my number one priority.

Bison:
...What you're saying is... I was bait?

Bison:
My father knew this would happen, so he sent you to...

Butler:
Young Master.

Bison:
......

Butler:
Young Master, some things are not as they seem. You will come to understand in time. And I promise, the Master of the House had no intention of exploiting you at any time.

Butler:
And I believe Penguin Logistics will also be expecting an explanation. I must secure the Rat King's remains and confirm that he is deceased.

Texas:
It's fine. The boss is gone. There's no one to hear you explain.

Butler:
Thank you for your understanding. Now, Young Master, do take care.

Bison:
......

Texas:
Bison, now is not the time to dwell on this.

Texas:
The Rat King promised us a 'gift', don't forget.

Mostima:
It might be a bomb. That Siracusan guy really liked bombs.

Exusiai:
That wouldn't be very clever.

Bison:
And there are still some enemies to worry about. It looks like they're waiting for us?

Bison:
The Rat King is gone, and they don't seem to be reacting at all?

Texas:
Right, no reaction whatsoever. Hm... I think I know what's happening...

Texas:
Let's split up. Sora, Croissant, Exusiai, we'll take care of the remaining enemies.

Texas:
Bison and Mostima, you deal with the 'gift.'

Texas:
It's almost sunrise. We're running out of time.

Bison:
Damn, where could it be...

Mostima:
You're all flustered. Try not to be so emotional.

Bison:
I did just find out that I was being kept in the dark about my whole purpose here.

Bison:
...Mostima, did we actually, maybe meet the Rat King before?

Mostima:
We did.

Bison:
So you had it all figured out from the beginning?

Mostima:
Ahahaha...

Bison:
Don't try to wriggle out of this one!

Mostima:
Hm. I couldn't have guessed what he was really up to.

Mostima:
But we really don't have much time. The LGD aren't going to sit on their hands.

Mostima:
As crazy as things have gotten around here, with them jumping in, there's no way we'd work it out.

Bison:
...Victorian gumdrops, the candy box, maybe that was a clue.

Bison:
But it's just common sense that using the same kind of trap over again would be really dumb.

Mostima:
Yeah, but, why?

Bison:
If the Rat King really had everything planned out, then us running into him before couldn't be a coincidence.

Bison:
He was communicating with us from the start.

Mostima:
It's his trap. Why would he want to give us clues? That doesn't make any sense.

Bison:
I don't know either, maybe we've been too quick to consider him an enemy...? I just have a feeling.

Bison:
It's not just a feeling. After we met the Rat King, he kept trying to hint at something... or something.

Mostima:
Mmm... Well, it's better than nothing.

Mostima:
Got it.

Bison:
This is it..?

Mostima:
Looks like it's about 80cm by 40cm, but in an iron box... Yep, this definitely seems like a big gift box to me?

Bison:
Could- could you explain?

Mostima:
Nope. I don't get it at all.

Bison:
Then we better call up Texas, maybe she and the girls can——

Mostima:
There's not enough time. This looks like it's got a timer on it.

Bison:
So it's a bomb?!

Mostima:
So it's a bomb. Pretty cliche. Both in shape and execution.

Bison:
Right... Mostima, you get out of here.

Mostima:
And what are you going to do?

Bison:
Take a chance.

Bison:
This is a custom shield, and my body is pretty tough too. If I play this wrong, I might still survive.

Mostima:
Are you serious?

Bison:
Yes.

Mostima:
Then I want to see how this plays out. And don't worry, I might be able to mitigate the damage from the explosion.

Mostima:
It's my job, after all.

Bison:
I know. *Inhale*

Bison:
*Exhale* Here I go!

Mostima:
......

Bison:
......

Mostima:
You decided? That wire's the same color as my hair.

Bison:
Erm! M- Mostima! Don't joke with me please! I'm almost——

Bison:
Ah.

Bison:
It hit zero! Get behind me!!

Mostima:
Okay, okay.

Bison:
Nnnngg...

Bison:
Why isn't it hot?

Bison:
Wait, this is... candy?!

Mostima:
Pay attention to how you land. You don't want to break anything.

Sora:
What's that sound?

Croissant:
Not sure, but... Woweee! There's people fallin' from the sky?!

Bison:
Ow ow ow, why is this happening again... Agh! S- sorry!

Croissant:
S'all right. What're you two doin' up there? Playin' trapeze artist?

Croissant:
Yowch! Somethin' just hit me?

Sora:
...Candy?

Sora:
It's raining... candy?

Texas:
Ugh, it's that sickly sweet smell in the air again.

Texas:
I think it's about time we wrapped this up.

Mafioso:
...Right.

Exusiai:
Hm? Um? Texas, do you know something we don't know?

Texas:
No. But I have a pretty solid idea.

Exusiai:
Hey!! If you had a lead, you should've told us!

Texas:
Sauin. It's long over.

Rat King's Henchman:
...Wanna get dim sum?

Mafioso:
So early? Let's go to the roof and watch the sunrise.

Rat King's Henchman:
You mafia types are funny. Always with the sunrise on the roof...

Mafioso:
Gah. This candy's smashed into my head so much I think I got brain damage. It's the signal to stop, and I stopped.

Mafioso:
But boy, it's more like we just got beaten on. My whole body's so tender...

Bison:
They... they all stopped. What's going on? This doesn't feel right.

Croissant:
We're all done, just like that? These fellers love candy so much?

Bison:
The candy rain stopped.

Mostima:
Yes, so fleeting. If only it would truly rain candy someday.

Bison:
So there was the candy...

Bison:
But wait, what about the bomb?

Mostima:
You mean this?

Bison:
Huh? You took the whole thing apart?

Mostima:
Just a minute.

Bison:
Mostima?!

Mostima:
Whoops, lost control there for a second. Hope you didn't get burned.

Bison:
This looks like an ordinary metal box?

Bison:
...And there's one piece of candy inside. Ew, it melted. It's all sticky...

Bison:
And this note? Is it from the Rat King...?

Mostima:
What does it say?

Bison:
'Happy Sauin'...

Bison:
......

Bison:
......

Bison:
.........Huh?
