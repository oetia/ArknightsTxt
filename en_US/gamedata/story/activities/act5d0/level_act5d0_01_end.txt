Penguin Logistics Base, Messy Room

Bison:
So this is where Penguin Logistics holes up...

Bison:
(It's like a disaster area. And so dark.)

Texas:
It's one of our bases. We haven't cleaned up in a while. Just sit wherever.

Bison:
Oh, thanks... I realize I didn't properly thank you, any of you.

Texas:
We did our jobs. You should introduce yourself first.

Bison:
I'm a Messenger, codenamed Bison. I'm from Lungmen, and I work for Mountain Dash Logistics. My father sent me to learn what I can from your company. And I appreciate the opportunity.

Bison:
Now about the contract between me and Mr. Emperor, I know we've already been over it, but...

Emperor:
Hold up, little man, I got a question. How'd your bigass daddy raise his boy to be so...

Texas:
...Boss.

Emperor:
Yeah yeah, go ahead.

Bison:
Anyway, about that ambush, it was definitely meant to provoke a reaction from MDL and Penguin Logistics.

Bison:
We can't take this sitting down. I can contact my father and the LGD. This is a case of aggravated assault...

Emperor:
Hey, Texas.

Texas:
Hm?

Emperor:
What's for dinner?

Exusiai:
We're throwing a welcome party, of course! But where's Sora? Didn't she stay home to hold down the fort?

Croissant:
Ya know she'll come a-runnin' soon as Texas gets on the horn.

Croissant:
Oh, sorry. You were sayin'?

Bison:
(Sora?)

Bison:
...Um, the first order of business is to figure out who attacked us. Does Penguin Logistics have any leads?

Exusiai:
Leads? It's a pretty basic business dispute.

Bison:
What do you mean, business dispute...?

Emperor:
Texas! Shouldn't I have a cigar in my hand by now?!

Exusiai:
Boss, it's been a while since we shacked up here. I think all your smokes went bad.

Texas:
Sora came here to clean before. She might have thrown them away.

Emperor:
Y'all for real? You tryin' to kill me? This is wack...

Emperor:
Yeah, you keep talkin.' Don't worry.

Bison:
Our first step should be to figure out exactly what these attackers were targeting...

Emperor:
Hold up, we need some tunes! Get some vinyl spinnin'! We got a whole box of them here, don't we?

Croissant:
Purdy sure I hauled one over. A box worth a couple months' salary.

Exusiai:
Found it. What do you want to hear?

Emperor:
Just throw on any one of 'em. Anything I picked out's gonna be fire.

Emperor:
It ain't life without music. Bless. Nice tunes, nice me.

Emperor:
Bison, what else you got?

Bison:
...Oh. Where was I?

Emperor:
Their target.

Bison:
Right! Well, their target was me, I guess, to try to provoke our two companies.

Emperor:
That's it? I figured it'd be some revenge thing...

Bison:
So you have a lead?

Emperor:
Sigh. Texas! Go scout 'em out!

Texas:
Triple overtime.

Exusiai:
Um, we get into scuffles like that maybe twenty times a month. Doesn't every Messenger deal with this all the time?

Bison:
...Why?

Bison:
Messengers should be quieter, quicker... you shouldn't be settling everything with violence all the time.

Exusiai:
Huh.

Texas:
We're a logistics company. Why are we always getting involved in gang wars?

Emperor:
cause they got no taste. They don't value their own lives.

Croissant:
And the baws signs our checks. We still get the goods where they need to go, all nice an' legal-like.

Croissant:
It's just we usually end up doin' some armed transport.

Exusiai:
Yeah. Like, what's the big deal?

Bison:
Umm...? You're really okay with that?

Texas:
Ugh...

Texas:
Wait a minute.

Texas:
Here, it's the passcode Sora left.

Bison:
C- cookies?

Exusiai:
Aww, why'd she open them and leave them here. They're no good when they get all soggy.

Texas:
The chocolate side is long, and the tail is short. That's the passcode.

Bison:
(That's some weird cryptography...)

Croissant:
Really? She wasn't kiddin' with that?

Texas:
...All I did was memorize what Sora said.

Texas:
'Suspect.' Hm. Maybe she chased them out.

Emperor:
Let her go. It's quittin' time.

Emperor:
And we got Sauin, so no overtime. Forget about capitalist oppression. We gotta pour one out for the homies.

Emperor:
Who's drinkin' with me?

Croissant:
Ooh, you buyin', baws? I heard some new top shelf booze just came in stock~

Emperor:
S'all good. You ladies got a lotta pay to dock, after all.

Croissant:
No thanks!

Bison:
Wait! We... we never came up with a plan.

Emperor:
Don't need one.

Bison:
We just let the mob get away with this?

Croissant:
Play it by ear.

Bison:
...The LGD won't butt in?

Exusiai:
Probably not. They're used to this stuff.

Bison:
Ugh...

Texas:
It is what it is. Just go with the flow.

Texas:
But last month's property damage invoice was a little longer than usual. You all need to be more careful.

Bison:
So what's your typical work like?

Exusiai:
We deliver the cargo in accordance with the contract, and then we fight. But if we have to fight, that kinda takes precedence.

Exusiai:
Oh and jobs go to the boss first. Then it's first come first serve, whoever can handle them.

Bison:
......

Emperor:
Hey, little man. Your daddy trusted you to me. So you're part of the Penguin Logistics family now, even if it's just for a bit.

Bison:
Er, yeah... I get it.

Emperor:
And you gotta remember the first rule of Penguin Logistics: 'Don't sweat the small stuff.'

Exusiai:
Wasn't the first rule 'live for the party' yesterday?

Croissant:
The one I heard was 'carpe diem.'

Emperor:
...pretty much.

Emperor:
Those ain't gonna be the last soldiers who wanna scoop you up and haul you off, but we're gonna take 'em one at a time. Simple as that.

Emperor:
Hold up, why's my ass feel funny? Somebody leave something in my perfect, ergonomic recliner?

Exusiai:
Um, I'll take a look.

Exusiai:
Oh, what an adorable little candy box! Boss, you were hiding snacks under your chair!

Emperor:
That's cap. Why would I stuff snacks in my... did you say candy box?

Exusiai:
It's a box of candies. See, it says 'Victorian Gumdrops' right here...

Texas:
Get back, Exusiai, don't open the——

Exusiai:
Huh?

Texas:
Gah! Get down.
