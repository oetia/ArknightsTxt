6:44 P.M. \ Clear

Lungmen Ring Expressway, Car

Butler:
Young Master?

Butler:
Young Master, are you asleep?

Bison:
Hm, oh... Where are we?

Butler:
We will soon arrive at the rendezvous point. Do clear your head, Young Master. Penguin Logistics is already there waiting for you.

Bison:
Mm. Right.

Butler:
You seem exhausted.

Bison:
I'm fine.

Butler:
Forgive my indiscretion, Sir, but you do seem to have made this decision in some haste. You know of course that you may at any time share any matters that trouble you.

Bison:
...My father... he definitely has his own ideas.

Bison:
But all I have to do is get Penguin Logistics on board. Then those guys won't be able to get between me and my father ever again.

Butler:
You are the youngest Messenger in the history of your family, Young Master. You perform all of your duties impeccably. Surely that will be enough.

Bison:
Maybe. But who knows if they'll feel the same way.

Butler:
Young Master...

Bison:
Looking out at the city, all I can think about is how almost all of Lungmen's Messenger firms belong to my father.

Bison:
Penguin Logistics is the last. And the most independent. And the one with a ton of weird rumors swirling around it.

Bison:
My father gets along pretty well with Mr. Emperor, but we have to do more to really get them. Or at least I do.

Butler:
That is why I worry, Young Master. I am well aware Penguin Logistics is a most peculiar organization.

Bison:
Don't look at me like that. I got this.

Butler:
You might change your expression as well, Young Master. Perhaps if you smiled more, like the boys your age.

Butler:
It's Sauin tonight. You could go out on the town with your friends.

Bison:
...real funny. Me not having friends is a joke to you, huh?

Butler:
Heavens no! Perish the thought! Haha.

Butler:
Dreadfully sorry, Young Master. Do you have your shield with you?

Bison:
What's up?

Butler:
I'm afraid we're being watched.

Gambino:
Target sighted. You ready?

Mafioso:
Gah, this fuse is still all...

Gambino:
Just do it already.

Bison:
Nng... an explosion?!

Butler:
Hold on, Young Master!

Mafioso:
Target sighted. He's still up.

Gambino:
Bring him in. Quick.

Bison:
(They bombed out the road...? But who...?)

Bison:
(Shit... my vision's... all blurry...)

Gambino:
Report.

Mafioso:
Lots of witnesses, but I don't see the other targets.

Mafioso:
Hold up, there's somebody in the smoke there!

Gambino:
Another survivor? You gotta-

Mafioso:
Nnng...

Gambino:
Hey? Hey!

Gambino:
You got whacked that easy?

Gambino:
Talk about a hackneyed mob movie plot,

Gambino:
Penguin Logistics.

???:
Ooh, sounds like you passed Screenwriting 101.

Exusiai:
But like, throwing up a roadblock on a suburban highway and burying a bomb on the side there. Isn't that also really cliche?

Gambino:
Demolition's just a hobby of mine. Take a look around and I think you'll find things ain't so simple.

Capone:
Damn. How much Originium did that mook use in his bomb? The Rat King'll have our balls for breakfast if he finds out.

Mafioso:
We found a Penguin Logistics Messenger. It's Exusiai. Looks like she bumped off the wrecking crew...

Capone:
Do I look blind to you? Where's the wolf? Texas?

Mafioso:
Dunno. Don't see her.

Capone:
Fuggedaboutit. Surround 'em. Let's get this done.

Exusiai:
An ambush, huh? They're nothing if not thorough.

Exusiai:
Hey, can you move? Your limbs are all shaky.

Bison:
Yeah, kinda... You must be... Exusiai?

Exusiai:
That's me! And you're... uh... Whatsisname!

Bison:
Bison.

Bison:
We... we should get out of here.

Exusiai:
Before you get all mopey, that old butlery guy is a-okay.

Bison:
Really?!

Exusiai:
I put him by the roadside for a minute, but he doesn't look like he needs much help... anyway!

Capone:
Exusiai, Messenger of Penguin Logistics, and the little rich kid there, give it up. Come with us nice and easy-like.

Exusiai:
All these fresh faces, must be your relatives from Siracusa? Didn't you teach them how things work in Lungmen?

Capone:
None of your damned business. We're cleaning you out for good this time.

Exusiai:
Oh come on... You've been in Lungmen so long you turned basic. Grabbing territory like a common thug.

Exusiai:
I guess at least some of the Siracusan Mafia can do more than just bar brawls.

Capone:
Grr... I'll teach you to look down on a Sicilian. *Lungmen Swearing* Get 'em!

Croissant:
Awright, looks like I'm right on time!

Exusiai:
Croissant, you made it!

Croissant:
But they're all so ornery. What're we gonna do?

Exusiai:
The usual. You clear a path, I'll bring up the rear, we split the completion bonus.

Croissant:
Now that's all ya had to say! Yeeehawww!

Mafioso:
Th- that crazy broad charged right through!

Capone:
...get after them. But not too close. Wait for backup.

Mafioso:
Got it!

Gambino:
You lost 'em, cazzo.

Capone:
Look, I ain't a kidnapping expert. The rest of Penguin Logistics never showed and we weren't about to go traipsing into downtown Lungmen by ourselves.

Gambino:
I don't wanna hear excuses. There's a car headed your way. Convertible. Old friends inside.

Capone:
...already?

Exusiai:
Gah, damn it. Another dead end?

Croissant:
It's a buncha old ruins nobody's touched fer ages. Lemme just make my own hole already.

Bison:
H- hold up! Where are we going?

Mafioso:
There they are! It's a dead end! We got 'em!

Bison:
It's game over, isn't it?

Exusiai:
Oh yeah!

Bison:
You have an idea?!

Exusiai:
We haven't properly introduced ourselves, have we?

Mafioso:
Rub 'em out!

Bison:
Now's not the time for this! We've got more important things to deal with!

???:
Nah.

???:
This is important. Real important.

???:
We got a serious emphasis on corporate culture. And today's culture buzzword is 'courtesy.'

Emperor:
I just came up with it.

Mafioso:
It's Emperor! Somebody call the boss!

Mafioso:
There's someone else with him!

Texas:
Came up empty, Exusiai.

Exusiai:
Not every Siracusan mook's a total moron. We'll get 'em next time, don't worry.

Exusiai:
But first, I've got to introduce you to Penguin Logistics's newest temp worker: Bison.

Mafioso:
They blocked the only way out. We- we have to fight through!

Texas:
Get down on the ground. You don't have to die.

Mafioso:
Woah! Settle down, we just have to hold out until the boss...!

Emperor:
Hold out?

Emperor:
Hit the lights.

Mafioso:
Agh! It's so bright! Where'd that spotlight come from?!

Emperor:
Welcome to Penguin Logistics, little doggies.

Emperor:
Now I can see you. And that means you're on land that belongs to the Penguin Empire.

Emperor:
Now I hate to bother you, but I'm gonna have to see your landing visa. You got it on you?

Emperor:
No?

Emperor:
Then I think we gotta send you crying home to your mamas.
