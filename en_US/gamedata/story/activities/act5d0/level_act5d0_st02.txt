Downtown Lungmen, Busy Street

Jaye:
...

Waai Fu:
Hey, you're doing the whole 'triad face' thing again, you know?

Jaye:
...Welcome back. Did you look into those people for me?

Waai Fu:
I came up with a rough sketch. As much as I'd like to bring these evildoers to justice, it looks like it's not going to be a one woman job.

Waai Fu:
I may have to ask for help at the office.

Waai Fu:
Seems they're not your run of the mill punks. And that Aak wasn't exactly forthcoming. He has to go and make everything so complicated...

Jaye:
I'm sorry, who?

Waai Fu:
Aak.

Jaye:
Ah?

Waai Fu:
...His name is Aak.

Jaye:
Oh... Okay, well, since it's not so simple,

Jaye:
I'll help out.

Waai Fu:
...You were listening, weren't you? A bunch of street thugs is one thing, but if we're dealing with a large-scale organized syndicate, we can't just go in there and start throwing punches.

Jaye:
We have other options besides going in there and starting to throw punches, don't we?

Waai Fu:
Are you really going to nail me on semantics?

Jaye:
I'm not joking.

Waai Fu:
...Is Uncle Tung okay?

Jaye:
He wasn't hurt badly. But that's not the point.

Waai Fu:
Right. It's not. If this were just some underworld spat, I wouldn't get involved.

Waai Fu:
But when I see the wicked strike the innocent before my very eyes, I can't sit idly by and let them run amok.

Jaye:
...Thanks. You've earned some finballs. On me.

Waai Fu:
I don't need finballs...

Waai Fu:
By the way,

Waai Fu:
This business tonight has something to do with Penguin Logistics. They're not even trying to cover up their involvement.

Jaye:
They're good people. They probably just got mixed up in it somehow.

Waai Fu:
They've gotten 'mixed up in things somehow' dozens of times this year alone. They need to be a little more careful, and stop making trouble for everyone.

Waai Fu:
If we run into them, we'll have to give them a warning.

Capone:
Sand Originium Arts. Hmph.

Capone:
Guess the freak running Lungmen's underworld had to have some teeth to him.

Mafioso:
Mr. Capone, you don't mean...?

Capone:
He ain't the kinda guy you wanna piss off, capiche?

Mafioso:
The Rat King? But we're facing off against the boss, Penguin Logistics, and...

Capone:
And half of Lungmen. Yeah, the outlook ain't so rosy. No room for mistakes.

Mafioso:
What're you doing, Mr. Capone? Put down the crossbow!

Capone:
You thought going against the Family would be easy?

Capone:
I remember the face of every last man who agreed to follow me to Lungmen, who's ready to betray Gambino for the sake of survival.

Capone:
And you ain't one of 'em. Take a dirt nap, Gambino dog.

Capone:
Get outta here.

Gambino:
Here I thought you were just an ungrateful cazzo. Now I see you learned to buy and sell men.

Capone:
Who do you think taught me?

Gambino:
Sure as hell wasn't me.

Capone:
You earned my loyalty. Then you let me down harder than anything ever has. I won't make that same mistake.

Gambino:
You know what betrayal means, don't you?

Capone:
It's Siracusa's greatest crime. But too bad for you, your honor and glory ain't worth shit in Lungmen.

Gambino:
Take it.

Capone:
...the Jack of Spades?

Gambino:
I told you. You deal too slow!

Capone:
You're even slower with that sword, Gambino. You get hurt in your fight with the Penguins? Or are we openin' old wounds?

Gambino:
Seeing you turn coward like this makes me sick. I'm stuck thinkin' about how I should kill a traitor like you.

Capone:
You're the Joker here now.

Capone:
What's next? What're you gonna do? You take out Penguin Logistics? You take out the Rat King? You take out the LGD? You take out Wei Yenwu?

Capone:
You're dreaming. Why not fall asleep forever?

Gambino:
Don't worry, I'll send your ashes back to Siracusa. Maybe I'll have the old village grind your corpse up.

Mafioso A:
Woah, what're you...?!

Gambino:
...What?

Capone:
Sounds like we got party crashers.

Gambino:
...I shoulda killed you quicker. But now we gotta play host.

Mafioso A:
Stop 'em! Aagh! My toe...

Mafioso B:
What's this, kung fu?! Can't even touch her!

Mafioso A:
They're unarmed, just get 'em... Oof!

Waai Fu:
...Phew.

Waai Fu:
So, it's you two?

Gambino:
I don't like to go around pickin' on weak little ladies, but...

Gambino:
You tore through my boys, walked right up to me, and you don't got a speck of dust on those pretty clothes of yours.

Gambino:
You the Rat King's people?

Jaye:
...Were you in the slums?

Capone:
You broke up a fight between Sicilians and you got the balls to ask questions?

Jaye:
...Yeah. I'd say it was you two.

Capone:
——?!

Capone:
This mook, argh——!

Waai Fu:
Are you just going to watch?

Gambino:
Don't get me wrong. It's always a good idea to borrow a knife to off somebody, but I gotta deal with this cazzo myself.

Gambino:
On the other hand... You look like you're a handful.

Waai Fu:
I think you should surrender. Really.

Gambino:
Hah!

Gambino:
You're about as good as that wolf. Who knew the Rat King had cards like you up his sleeve!

Waai Fu:
What cards? What are you talking about? Just get down on the floor and turn yourself in!

Gambino:
Nng!

Capone:
Hey, I remember you. I met you before. You dressed up like a seafood salesman. Played like you were making finballs.

Capone:
Funny. I never thought I'd have to give you a second look.

Jaye:
No, I really am a... never mind.

Jaye:
Right now, just for tonight, I am what you think I am.

Waai Fu:
Hai-yah!

Gambino:
Hmph!

Capone:
You gettin' beat by a girl over there, Gambino.

Gambino:
Oh I'm still gonna kill you. Wipe that smile off your face.

Jaye:
...You've been looking for chances to take a low blow, dirty fighter.

Waai Fu:
How can you hope to win if you strike with the wrong part of your fist?

Waai Fu:
You will pay for the harm you have done.

Uncle Tung:
...You had me wait so long just to bring me here?

Uncle Tung:
What is this about? Are we looking at grave plots? You want to be my neighbor even in death?

Rat King:
After so many years in business, how do you keep such a sharp tongue?

Uncle Tung:
I don't talk to my customers like this. But you're not a customer.

Rat King:
I'm hurt.

Rat King:
......

Uncle Tung:
...This is Ah Faat's grave. You probably don't know him.

Uncle Tung:
This one's Rascally Chan's, and over here is Fake Yama.

Uncle Tung:
Then in the back is Old Wu and the Steel Psycho, plus Lucky On. Lucky On's family was rich, so he got the hillside plot.

Rat King:
So many.

Uncle Tung:
At least they're all neighbors. We should think about where we'll stay too.

Rat King:
I think it's still too early for that. Or are you trying to tell me you've got some terminal illness?

Uncle Tung:
It's not early. We don't live long enough, so it always feels like we've been through tough times.

Uncle Tung:
Like me. Our brothers gave their lives for us. But now that I've settled down, I look back and reflect on my life...

Uncle Tung:
And nothing seems like that big a deal anymore. If there was anything really that big, I wouldn't be able to enjoy a peaceful life.

Rat King:
Oh my. Did selling finballs bring you such enlightenment?

Uncle Tung:
Honestly, food price inflation is a lot more dangerous to me than the mob.

Uncle Tung:
...Dai Lo, won't you be my neighbor here? The Feng Shui is excellent, and I hear you get a better deal buying the plots in pairs.

Rat King:
Are you done?

Uncle Tung:
I'm joking. It's a joke. Aiya. At least you have a daughter. I'm going to die alone.

Rat King:
You have all the kids in the slums with you, don't you? And that Ah Fil boy.

Uncle Tung:
But there's no blood. It makes a difference when you get old.

Uncle Tung:
...So you have to outlive me, a bit. Not too much. Just a bit. I'll wait for you down there.

Rat King:
Are you always looking for ways to needle me?

Rat King:
By the way, I'm meeting an old friend later tonight. Would you like to join us for a drink?

Uncle Tung:
No thanks. I'm worried Ah Fil is off getting himself into trouble. I'd better look into it.

Rat King:
I'll look into it for you.

Uncle Tung:
And how many old friends do I have left? I think they're all down there.

Rat King:
You have one.

Uncle Tung:
I can't talk with the one called Wei. I've been dealing with him a long time. It would be very short-lived.

Rat King:
But you took a bullet for Wei Yenwu. It's why you can't walk straight anymore.

Uncle Tung:
You think I don't know? Feh, I don't want to talk about this. It always makes me feel wretched.

Uncle Tung:
...But at least Lungmen can walk straight. At least she's not wretched.

Rat King:
You're the same as you ever were. And I guess that's a good thing.

Rat King:
If you've really seen enough of him, then you better be on your way.

Rat King:
And even if he did see you, he probably wouldn't know what to say.

Uncle Tung:
You finally let me go, Lin, this poor old wounded man.

Rat King:
......

Rat King:
Mr. Tung.

Uncle Tung:
What's that?

Rat King:
Live a while longer. Sell some more finballs.

Rat King:
Buy yourself a building, open a restaurant, take a few apprentices, and then maybe think about where to put your coffin. There's no rush.

Rat King:
The Rat King still lives. It's not your turn to die yet.

Uncle Tung:
...fine.
