Passerby A:
Woah, are they shooting a movie or something?

Passerby B:
Aren't those the Penguin Logistics people? They're fighting again?

Passerby B:
Give 'em a left hook! Now right! C'mon! Yeah!

Passerby A:
They always win every fight. It's boring.

Passerby B:
Yeah. Hey, you mooks in black, don't lose too bad!

Exusiai:
Ugh, it's such a pain when you can't use live ammo.

Croissant:
How many times do we gotta tell ya, no live ammo downtown. Exusiai, behind ya!

Exusiai:
Eep! That was close~ Thanks, Croissant.

Bison:
Does this never end?! Texas!

Texas:
Right... Sora with me, Exusiai with Croissant, divide and conquer. To the ends of the earth.

Bison:
...what?

Sora:
Aweso... I mean, affirmative.

Exusiai:
Oh~ cut 'em in two, huh? No problem. That's my specialty!

Croissant:
You might play it a bit safer, Exusiai. Our damage bill's gettin' mighty long...

Croissant:
Hold on, what does 'to the ends of the earth' mean there?

Texas:
We regroup in an hour.

Bison:
What does it mean?!

Sora:
But how do we fight our way out?

Exusiai:
I've got an idea...

Mafioso:
Wh- what the hell are you doing?! I ain't scared of you, angel girl!

Exusiai:
Hop on, Croissant! This bike's pretty sweet, huh?

Croissant:
You got it! Let's ride!

Texas:
Hijacking? Good idea.

Texas:
Alright, you're up.

Mafioso:
Stay back, friggin' wolf.. You... Aieee! Not in the face! Fine, take the bike!

Texas:
Get on, Sora.

Sora:
Y- yeah okay!

Texas:
Hold on tight. I can't let Exusiai outrun me.

Sora:
You could maybe, maybe go a little slower——

Bison:
Then I guess...

Bison:
......

Mafioso:
......

Bison:
......

Mafioso:
They left this kid behind?

Mafioso:
Sounds good to me. Let's get him!

Bison:
What are these guys thinking?!

Bison:
Darn it...! I need a vehicle!

Passerby A:
Hey, you looking for a bike? I could lend you one.

Bison:
A bicycle?

Bison:
Well, beggars can't be choosers. Thanks!

Passerby A:
Go get 'em!

Mafioso:
That was a pretty bold thing you did there. Helping out Penguin Logistics...

Passerby A:
You guys got wheels. You should be able to catch him.

Mafioso:
You...

Capone:
Leave it. Don't mess with the civilians. Don't wanna get us in trouble.

Mafioso:
S- sorry. After him! Everybody get after him!

Capone:
Hmph...

Gambino:
'Kidnap Bison, split Penguin Logistics and MDL, rub out Emperor,' that was your great plan.

Capone:
Our goal is to take their place. No need to bury those idiots. I think you can do the math on this one?

Gambino:
Texas, she's Texas. Then you got the Laterano girl and the MDL princeling. You think we can leave 'em breathing and still sleep at night?

Gambino:
We gotta salt the earth here.

Capone:
That's a good way to get a lot of eyes on us. We ain't the only seat at this table.

Gambino:
Hah! You scared?

Capone:
Gotta know when to fold 'em, cazzo.

Gambino:
Getting down on my hands and knees for the Rat King was as low as I'm ever gonna go. All this time in Lungmen's turned you coward. Scared of your own damned tail.

Gambino:
You done a lot for the Family, but you're lucky I ain't kicked you to the curb yet.

Capone:
You do what you gotta do. We can come back to that one.

Gambino:
Damn right. Now I gotta deal with Penguin Logistics my way.

Gambino:
A stiff can't come back and bite you in the ass, capiche?

Capone:
...you do it your way. But I'm just gonna warn you one last time: this ain't Siracusa. We're in Lungmen now.

Gambino:
And it's after we blew it in Siracusa that I realized: we don't pass up an opportunity. We're not gonna compromise, negotiate, and fall into another trap.

Gambino:
We're gonna use everything we got to totally wipe out the competition.

Gambino:
We're gonna do this the old way, like the true Sicilians we are.

Capone:
......

Capone:
Right. The Family don't need cowards... the Family don't need rubes.

Capone:
Send some guys into the slums to find the Rat King. Let him know the deal's changed.

Mafioso:
Mr. Capone, you know if we can't get the Rat King to see sense...

Capone:
Listen, if we're gonna do business in Lungmen, can we really let a rat hang over our heads the whole time?

Capone:
We gotta do something about him sooner or later.

Capone:
Go down this list of Lungmenites we know have some connection to the Rat King.

Mafioso:
Alright.

Capone:
We don't have a lotta time here. I need results tonight. Get going.

Capone:
Did I do anything with all these years in Lungmen...?

Capone:
You screwed up, Gambino Ricci. Really screwed the pooch.
