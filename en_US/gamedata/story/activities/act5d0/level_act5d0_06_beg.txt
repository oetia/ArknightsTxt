Sunset Boulevard, 'The Ends of the Earth' lounge

Croissant:
Say baws, what year's this vintage?

Emperor:
Hmm, maderized coloring, lively aroma, robust flavor, velvety texture, this is...

Emperor:
Last month. A forty of malt liquor from the corner store.

Croissant:
Perfect scores up and down, baws! That's why they call ya Lungmen's self-proclaimed number one sow-mel-eer!

Emperor:
*Pfft* How many times do I gotta tell you? This is a reserve weapon. It ain't for drinking! Sora!

Sora:
Okay, okay, here's your mouthwash.

Croissant:
Um... did ya mean to wash yer mouth with Yan huangjiu...?

Texas:
Alcohol is a disinfectant. There's industrial alcohol under the bar. That would do the trick.

Croissant:
S'all good. We got money so we might as well spend it. It's all in the process, y'know? Ain't the amount. It's the process of spending!

Exusiai:
Everybody, the apple pie's ready! It's time to party!

Croissant:
Oooh~ Exusiai's homemade apple pie!

Emperor:
Bottoms up!

Sora:
...so like, what exactly are we partying for?

Exusiai:
Huh? It's Bison's welcome party.

Sora:
...so like, where's Bison?

Exusiai:
Um! I dunno!

Emperor:
Then pick another reason. We always got a reason to party.

Bison:
...What are you guys doing?

Croissant:
Awright. Here's the guest of honor himself.

Emperor:
Hey. Welcome to The Ends of the Earth.

Emperor:
You're late. That's three shots. Guest of honor drinks triple, but you can't drink. So that's nine sodas. Drink up.

Bison:
Why is it called The Ends of the Earth?

Bison:
(And the decor is so gaudy... And what's with the penguin... is this some kind of punk thing...?)

Exusiai:
Don't just stand there with your tongue hanging out. This is your welcome party! Apple pie?

Bison:
...No thanks.

Bison:
So while me and Mostima were out there fighting off mobsters, you were in here partying?

Bison:
So... what happened to their leader?

Texas:
He got away.

Emperor:
To be more precise, we let him get away.

Bison:
Regardless, he got away... so what do we do next?

Texas:
We know the enemy's identity, their goal, and their numbers.

Texas:
They're the Siracusan Mafia, and they wanted to take Penguin Logistics's territory in Lungmen.

Texas:
...even though we're a logistics firm and... never mind.

Sora:
Don't sweat it, Texas. We've always got a few days here and there to take out the trash.

Croissant:
When ya say it like that, it makes us sound even less like a legitimate business, don't it?

Exusiai:
They don't know what they're talking about. They couldn't fill the boss's t-shirt for two minutes without cracking under the pressure.

Emperor:
Penguin Logistics is a unique operation. And I'm a step even more unique.

Bison:
But that means we have lots of options for how to work this out. Why do we have to fight with them?

Texas:
I don't know.

Bison:
You don't know? How have you been...

Emperor:
Alright, alright, let's not put too much brainpower into this. Find an opportunity to grab their boss, huck him in the river and boom, we're done.

Emperor:
This whole thing has been one big ass waste of time. I just. Don't. Give. A shit.

Exusiai:
Seriously. This isn't really worth spending any more time on. Here, gum.

Bison:
Om...

Bison:
But we at least need to come up with a plan to... Wait, what flavor is this gum?

Exusiai:
White Horse Kohl flavor.

Texas:
Croissant, please add this brand of gum to our hazardous materials list.

Croissant:
We were runnin' low so I grabbed the new flavor. Didn't notice what it was. Oops.

Emperor:
Yo, are we gonna party or what? We got food, we got drinks, where's the tunes?

Exusiai:
I'm on it~!

Bison:
I wasn't expecting jazz... even if it's a little...

Exusiai:
The previous owner was something of a jazz lover, but after the boss took over we had to make a few style changes.

Sora:
A few?

Texas:
It's pretty much because the boss's own records all got toasted in that——

Emperor:
Enough. Let's not bring back any tragic memories.

Emperor:
And besides, nobody asked him to go get sick. Here I am takin' time outta my busy schedule to look after his bar.

Bison:
is it Oripathy?

Bison:
Lungmen's been through a lot. They should've changed the way they look at the Infected...

Emperor:
Nah.

Emperor:
He picked up an alcohol allergy.

Bison:
......

Croissant:
He was fixin' to be the greatest bartender in all Lungmen. Fer a feller like that, we call it terminal.

Emperor:
We got some party crashers. Yo, get behind the bar if you wanna live.

Croissant:
Yessir!

Exusiai:
Nice! There's a coin back here.

Sora:
Don't squirm around, there's not much room back here——Ow! Watch your halo, Exusiai!

Texas:
Stop gawking and get down, Bison.

Bison:
Huh? Ah!

Mafioso:
Get 'em!

Croissant:
Welp, that's the end of this place.

Bison:
Mr. Emperor's still out there. Will he be okay?!

Emperor:
Why are these punks still up in my business? Shoot back already, before they completely trash the joint!

Exusiai:
Sorry, boss, I'm all out of rubber bullets. Should we go at them with the barstools?

Emperor:
Did I not buy a forty of malt liquor and leave it here for just such an occasion?!

Croissant:
Um, we just drank the last bottle. All we got left is the top shelf stuff.

Emperor:
Use it. I ain't some stuffy old rich man, filling my palaces with fancy show-off booze.

Emperor:
Let this liquor show us what it's worth.

Croissant:
Huh? But the price on this stuff's higher than——

Emperor:
Grab it, hold it in your hand, and remember: aim for the head.

Emperor:
Protecting this bar means protecting my land. Come on.

Texas:
Exusiai.

Exusiai:
Got it! Take a bottle and smash a head. No problem!

Sora:
W- wait for me!

Mafioso:
They're charging, watch out! Gah!

Croissant:
That's a hundred thousand. Hundred and fifty thousand. Four hundred and fifty thousand. Seven hundred thousand...

Croissant:
How much was that one? No! Exusiai! Not that one—— agh.

Bison:
What's... huh...?

Croissant:
Tonight's property damage bill. At least you and I got our shields to fight with. Don't want that number gettin' any bigger.

Bison:
R- right.

Croissant:
Okay~ Three, two, one, go!
