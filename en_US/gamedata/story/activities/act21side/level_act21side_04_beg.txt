Exusiai:
Sora, are you ready yet?

Sora:
Stop rushing me!

Sora:
Urgh... This dress is so tight!

Exusiai:
You haven't been chubbing up on pizza behind my back, have you?

Sora:
What are you even talking about? I only had <i>one</i> extra slice last night!

Croissant:
Sora, suck it in!

Sora:
Hissss—

Croissant:
Alrighty! Perfect!

Croissant:
You're good.

Exusiai:
Done? Come on out already and let me see!

Sora:
Coming, coming.

Exusiai:
Wooooah, you look amazing!

Croissant:
You'n say that again. One purdy lady!

Sora:
Heehee.

Exusiai:
*sigh*... If only Texas was here to see you too.

Sora:
Yeah...

Croissant:
I knew you had it in ya though, Sora. Ya made it onstage here in Siracusa mighty quick.

Sora:
But of course~

Sora:
This time, 'La Morte di Texas' will be presented in multiple acts. We've already finished rehearsing the first one, and the opening night is the day after tomorrow!

Sora:
If everything goes well, maybe she'll be the one looking for me, rather than the other way around~

Exusiai:
That could happen. Lemme think... Yeah, if it comes to that, I'm definitely gonna buy a pizza to slap her face around a bit.

Croissant:
Speakin' of Texas, I've been talkin' up the Bellone family. I hear tell things've been awful rough for 'em lately. Hope that ain't gettin' in her way.

Exusiai:
She's gonna be perfectly fine.

Croissant:
Most we'n do right now is keep the faith in her.

Croissant:
We oughta rest up before Sora's debut too.

Exusiai:
I originally wanted to take a look around the city, but it feels like I've turned into Sora's bodyguard.

Sora:
Bite me.

Exusiai:
But hey, I've eaten my weight in the free food at the theater. Hehe, their pizza's not half bad.

Exusiai:
Things are probably only gonna get busier from here on out, so let's go for a walk.

Sora:
Okay.

Cheery Actress:
Hey, did you hear...?

Meddlesome Actress:
You're talking... Tex... right?

Sora:
Huh?

Cheery Actress:
Right, Texas... sentenced...

Sora:
Ehh?

Sora:
Excuse me, did you just say something about Texas?

Cheery Actress:
Yup, sure did. You interested?

Sora:
What happened to Texas?

Cheery Actress:
My boyfriend's with Famiglia Bellone, and I heard it from him.

Cheery Actress:
You know how il Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici was killed a few days ago?

Cheery Actress:
Apparently, they found the culprit.

Cheery Actress:
The one who did it was the last of the Texas bloodline. I think her name was Cellinia or something?

Sora:
......

Sora:
No way!

Cheery Actress:
They even decided on the court date. It's the day after tomorrow.

Wallach:
Signor Leontuzzo, we agreed on this meeting, but you've already pushed it back several times.

Leontuzzo:
My sincerest apologies, Signor Wallach, but I've had too much to deal with lately.

Wallach:
I hear you've already withdrawn a lot of your men from several areas previously under contention with other famiglie. I'm worried about you.

Wallach:
I'm glad to see that you're alive and well.

Leontuzzo:
It's nothing major, just cutting our losses.

Wallach:
Haha, I'm quite fond of that prudent side of yours.

Wallach:
Don't worry, Famiglia Rossati has no interest in kicking a man when he's down.

Wallach:
But there is one problem that I must reluctantly bring up.

Leontuzzo:
It has to be about Texas.

Wallach:
'Cellinia Texas.' Is she back, and even one of your bodyguards?

Wallach:
Is it really her?

Leontuzzo:
What if I say yes?

Wallach:
......

Wallach:
We never knew she was alive this whole time.

Leontuzzo:
Back then, it was my father who saved her.

Wallach:
I see, I see. This was the old don's handiwork.

Leontuzzo:
The construction of the new city was, from the very beginning, because of the fate Salvadore shared with Siracusa. My father only hoped she could return to Siracusa to see the city.

Wallach:
Such is Famiglia Bellone.

Wallach:
Despite knowing full well the significance of the Texas name to Famiglia Rossati, you still invited her to come back so graciously.

Wallach:
Impressive. Truly impressive.

Wallach:
I, Wallach, can only offer my admiration.

Leontuzzo:
Again with your jokes.

Wallach:
Jokes? How is any of this a joke?

Wallach:
The news that Signorina Cellinia is still alive means a great deal to us Rossatis.

Wallach:
No matter how the Bellones see it, we are in your debt.

Leontuzzo:
Our two famiglie will see this new city built, hand-in-hand. What debt is there to speak of?

Wallach:
Hahaha! Very good, I love it!

Wallach:
By the looks of things, fratello, you've been waiting for me all this time.

Wallach:
So tell me, what is it you want?

Leontuzzo:
Simple—

Leontuzzo:
For the Rossatis to stay out of this.

Wallach:
Oh? You want us to stand aside and watch the last Texas go down? That's not going to fly with the boss.

Leontuzzo:
After the trial is over, she'll be held in custody and you'll still be able to see her.

Wallach:
Just see her?

Leontuzzo:
She's our guest, but she could also be yours.

Wallach:
Alright, it's a deal!

Demetri:
......

Demetri:
So this is when you decide to reveal Cellinia? That's certainly unexpected...

Demetri:
Was it Lavinia's idea? No... There's no way for her to know that Cellinia wasn't the murderer.

Demetri:
Knowing her, this isn't a decision she'd make.

Demetri:
Could Leon have convinced her?

Demetri:
Never mind. In any case, I didn't expect this card to get played.

Mafioso:
Demetri, what're we doin' now?

Mafioso:
Time to rub out Cellinia?

Demetri:
Do you have any idea how many heavies she put down during the chaos that broke out seven years ago?

Mafioso:
But—

Demetri:
An ambush, explosives, or a good, old-fashioned poisoning. We might have a way...

Demetri:
But don't forget to take into account whoever invited her back.

Demetri:
Whoever they might be, it undeniably was a clever move.

Demetri:
Now that things have come to this, we're forced to resort to more... brutal methods to put this trial on ice.

Mafioso:
......

Demetri:
At the end of the day, our goal is to plunge the city into chaos.

Demetri:
From the very beginning, we've been here to provoke Signora Sicilia.

Demetri:
Now, all we're doing is taking another step forward.

Mafioso:
Gotcha.

???:
If you ask me, I think there's another option.

Demetri:
Who's there?!

Lappland:
Whatever you're doing sounds like fun. Mind if I join in?

Bernardo:
......

Bernardo:
Come in.

Sora:
Director, did you hear the news about Texas?!

Bernardo:
I did, just now.

Sora:
Do you have any clue what's going on behind the scenes?

Bernardo:
I got the news from Judge Lavinia's own announcement.

Sora:
Lavinia, the judge who helped me...

Sora:
She... doesn't seem like the type to lie, but...

Bernardo:
Are you going to postpone your debut?

Sora:
Could you... please help me come up with something?

Sora:
I at least... want to see her first.

Bernardo:
And regardless of whether or not your debut can be pushed back...

Bernardo:
I want to know what happens when you do see her.

Sora:
......

Bernardo:
Signorina Sora, I remember you said you came to Siracusa with two friends to look for her.

Bernardo:
You always believed in the woman you knew, that she was truly who you thought she was.

Bernardo:
But now, you know her hidden past.

Bernardo:
You've been forced to learn that the woman you've been chasing might be an entirely different person.

Bernardo:
Say you go see her. What then?

Bernardo:
What are you going to say to her, and what is she going to say to you?

Sora:
If that's the way things are, then maybe it's all my own fault. Maybe I never knew her well enough.

Bernardo:
Even if she was clearly keeping something from you?

Sora:
That depends on her reason for doing it.

Sora:
Anyway, Mr. Bernardo, showbiz is a big melting pot, and I've met all kinds.

Sora:
It's way too hard to be the person you claim to be. At least, I don't think I can pull it off.

Sora:
I always think to myself, one day I'm going to turn into someone I'm not.

Sora:
So, I never expect it from other people.

Sora:
Everybody has their secrets. I do, she does, and I'm sure you do too.

Sora:
If she wants to keep her mask on until the very end, and that's the side she wants me to see, isn't that also genuine, in its own way?

Bernardo:
Absolutely.

Sora:
Also, maybe I didn't express myself clearly enough.

Sora:
I'm not looking for Texas so I can give her a piece of my mind. Not at all.

Sora:
The four of us lived together in Lungmen for almost six years.

Sora:
Six years, precious to me beyond words.

Sora:
And I sincerely believe... they're just as precious to her.

Sora:
Still, she still left without saying goodbye.

Sora:
Should I be upset over that?

Sora:
I'm not. I'm worried sick about her.

Sora:
Exusiai and Croissant would say the same thing.

Sora:
That's why we came to Siracusa.

Sora:
If she's caught up in some trouble, then we're going to bail her out.

Sora:
If the weight of her past is enough to make her crumble, we'll be there to share that burden with her.

Bernardo:
Through many plays, the fate of Famiglia Texas is known far and wide, even if the rumors of Cellinia's death were exaggerated.

Bernardo:
Her past is likely much deeper than you can imagine.

Sora:
I know.

Sora:
But we haven't heard it from her, directly.

Sora:
She has to tell us what she thinks herself.

Sora:
Only then, if she still decides to part ways with us, after everything we've been through... Only then can I say goodbye without a weight on my heart.

Sora:
Only if I try my best, can go move on without any regrets.

Sora:
Well... I'd probably still have some regrets, but they wouldn't be that bad.

Bernardo:
You speak with a great deal of wisdom, Signorina Sora.

Sora:
I'm just trying to come up with excuses for my bravado, that's all.

Sora:
But I do feel much better after having talking to you about this.

Sora:
You are right, though. If I went to see her right now, I don't think there's anything I'd be able to do for her.

Bernardo:
Actually, I was ready to agree to your request.

Bernardo:
After the trial, you will see her. I can promise you that.

Sora:
Really?!

Bernardo:
But for the time being, you'll have to keep waiting.

Sora:
Thank you so much! I have got to get ready first.

Bernardo:
Haha.

Bernardo:
Unfortunately, I won't be there to see your debut in person.

Sora:
Huh? You're not going to watch?

Bernardo:
That's right. I'm afraid I have something important to do that day.

Bernardo:
But, don't worry. I've already prepared the best possible stage for you.

Sora:
Thank you!

Sora:
I'd better get going, then.

Bernardo:
See you.

Bernardo:
......

Bernardo walks over to the shelf and pulls out a book.

A legal codex wrapped in thorns.

He remains silent for a long time until finally, he places a call.

Bernardo:
Demetri... tell her. Just say, I agreed.

With a boom, thunder surges outside the window.

It seems to augur the heavy rain about to come.
