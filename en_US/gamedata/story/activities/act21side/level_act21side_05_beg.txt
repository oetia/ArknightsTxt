Wallach:
Though I considered the possibility that Leontuzzo was trying to pull a fast one on me behind my back, my suspicions were confirmed the moment I saw you.

Wallach:
You're the real deal, a flesh-and-blood Texas.

Texas:
......

Wallach:
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Wallach of Famiglia Rossati.

Texas:
You're Columbian?

Wallach:
Of course. Most associates of Famiglia Rossati are.

Wallach:
So, how did you enjoy prison life here?

Texas:
There was nothing special about it.

Wallach:
Strange. Logically, you never should've spent so long in jail in the first place. Just what was Bellone thinking?

Texas:
Is there something unusual about obeying the law?

Wallach:
The law? What do the courts here in Siracusa have to do with the so-called law?

Wallach:
Look at it this way. In most Siracusan cities, standing trial and going to jail is a common coming-of-age ritual for a young mafioso.

Wallach:
After that, his famiglia associates go pick him up, like a warrior returning home triumphant.

Wallach:
Everything on the surface here is meaningless to those who live by the underworld's ways.

Texas:
What's your point?

Wallach:
You grew up in Columbia. Do I need to spell it out for you?

Wallach:
'A complete joke.' There's no other way to say it.

Wallach:
But that's why we were able to establish ourselves here so easily.

Texas:
Do you enjoy talking politics?

Wallach:
You obviously don't.

Wallach:
To be honest with you, I'm not a fan either.

Wallach:
I'll get to the point then. Why aren't you dead.

Texas:
None of your business.

Wallach:
Fine. Let me ask you a different question then. Why did you come back?

Texas:
Didn't Leontuzzo tell you already? I owe the Bellones a favor.

Wallach:
So, let me get this straight. You knew the Bellones wanted to bring you back to deal with us Rossatis, but you still went along with it.

Texas:
I didn't know that until I got here, but... you could say that.

Wallach:
Your bluntness makes me wonder if there's something wrong with me, last of the Texases.

Wallach:
Are you going to tell me you forgot the Texas name used to rule all of Columbia's famiglie, large and small?

Wallach:
That your grandfather, Salvadore, was the lodestar for every associate of every famiglia in Columbia?!

Texas:
......

Texas:
What the Texases left behind... has nothing to do with me.

Wallach:
Nothing to do with you?!

Wallach smashes his fist into the coffee table next to him, and fresh blood begins to seep from his fingers.

He does not seem to realize it.

Wallach:
You are Cellinia Texas! The granddaughter of Salvadore!

Wallach:
As long as you live, those things have <i>everything</i> to do with you!

Wallach:
The mere mention of your name at a Rossati table forces us to change the way we do things!

Wallach:
Texas was our pride!

Wallach:
Do you know how much effort Giovanna put in to reunite the remaining Columbian famiglie so that Salvadore's blood and sweat would not go to waste?

Wallach:
Do you have any idea what it was like to finally give in to Signora Sicilia, traveling thousands of miles to go from Columbia to Siracusa?

Wallach:
In order to survive, we even gave up the technology to build a nomadic city, basically letting Siracusa construct a new one for freeâ€”

Wallach:
That was all because of the fall of Texas. It left us no choice but to accept this reality.

Wallach:
And now you, the last Texas, deign to set foot here like you own the damned place.

Wallach:
Claiming that you have nothing to do with all this, that you're just here to pay off a debt.

Wallach:
You even go so far as to stand against us!

Wallach:
You owe the Bellones?

Wallach:
That you're even alive means you owe a much bigger debt to the Columbian famiglie!

Texas:
I might owe Giovanna an explanation, but I don't owe a thing to the Columbians.

Texas:
After I settle my accounts with the Bellones, I'm leaving Siracusa.

Wallach:
You think we'll take your word for it?

Wallach:
Your very existence shakes the foundations of Famiglia Rossati.

Texas:
......

Texas:
Where's Giovanna?

Wallach:
What?

Texas:
I'm asking, why are you here? Instead of Giovanna?

Wallach:
I speak for her.

Texas:
She wouldn't, for example, grovel at Signora Sicilia's feet.

Texas:
Same as she wouldn't send a representative to meet me.

Wallach:
You think you know her so well?

Texas:
Judging from your expression, looks like I'm right.

Wallach:
......

Wallach:
Hah... Isn't that unlucky.

Wallach:
Turns out I'm the one who doesn't know enough about the legendary Texas.

Wallach:
I always thought I was a pretty good actor.

Texas:
You're not bad.

Texas:
But, you speak eloquently and at great lengths about Siracusa, as if you've seen through the country for what it is. It feels... very familiar to me.

Texas:
I wouldn't keep doing that, if I were you.

Wallach:
Why not?

Texas:
Because it proves... you don't understand this place well enough.

Wallach:
......

Texas:
But, you are right about one thing. Now that I'm back, I should go have a chat with Giovanna.

Wallach:
You won't be seeing her.

Wallach:
Sorry about this, last of the Texases.

Wallach:
You're too much like a Siracusan. No, you <i>are</i> a Siracusan, through and through.

Wallach:
So I cannot let you see the Donna.

Wallach:
You'll shake her. And you'll shake others too. You'll bring ruin to a great many things.

Wallach:
So, please turn back.

Wallach:
Go close the deal you have with the Bellones, and then crawl back wherever you came from.

Wallach:
You're free to do what you want from here.

Wallach:
But, I'll ask you to bear one thing in mind.

Wallach:
Famiglia Rossati does not welcome you.

Texas stands up and walks to the door.

Unconsciously, the would-be assassins part and make way for her.

She looks around, reading anger, bewilderment, disgust, confusion, and other emotions in the eyes of the Columbians.

That is what her surname brings to the table.

Texas.

She lets out a sigh and exits the room.

Demetri:
What an unexpected guest.

Lavinia:
I want to see Bernardo.

Demetri:
I've already warned you several times before not to call the Don by his first name, Signorina Lavinia.

Lavinia:
You know where he is, don't you?

Demetri:
Give me one reason why I should tell you.

Lavinia:
If standing here listening to you mock me from your position as the big winner is enough to get you to tell me, I'll gladly play along.

Demetri:
The big winner, huh...?

Demetri:
Whatever.

Demetri:
It's not like you knowing will do any harm. The Don already left for the Saluzzo mansion.

Demetri:
You won't be able to see him.

Demetri:
If you want to stir up trouble in his household, that's on you.

Demetri:
But if the Don has decided to open discussions with the Saluzzos, I suggest you don't stick your head where it doesn't belong.

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
Don't need to tell me twice.

Demetri:
One more thing, Signorina Lavinia.

Demetri:
I don't care what you think about me.

Demetri:
But, I hope you do remember this.

Demetri:
Leon is a made man in this famiglia, and he was the first to deviate from our path.

Demetri:
We are all one famiglia, and a famiglia ought to stick together.

Lavinia:
Your path?

Lavinia:
That's a nice euphemism for craven ambition.

Demetri:
Heh.

A droplet of rain strikes the ridge of her eye socket and rolls down like a teardrop.

Never in her life has Lavinia experienced rain so frigid and biting in Siracusa.

But she promptly wipes away the streaks.

It's too soon for that.

Texas:
Who is it?

Lavinia:
I'm looking for Penguin Logistics.

Texas:
That's me.

Lavinia:
Do you have time right now?

Texas:
I have a moment.

Lavinia:
What services does your business offer?

Texas:
We deliver letters, messages, goods, and... people.

Texas:
Rain or shine.

Lavinia:
Perfect. I have a job for you.

Exusiai:
Oh, Sora, you went to Caterina's place after all?

Sora:
There are tons of resources here, and Miss Caterina even left her notes in a lot of these scripts.

Sora:
She's really passionate about her job, huh?

Sora:
*sigh*...

Croissant:
Stop sighin', won'tcha?

Croissant:
Everybody knows yer actin' thingy ain't just another way of chasin' Texas. Leastwise, you don't want it to be.

Sora:
Right. But, finding her is still our top priority...

Sora:
After all, Lappland is back in Siracusa, and she's been doing some pretty crazy stuff.

Exusiai:
If you think about, it makes perfect sense.

Exusiai:
It always feels like she's there, wherever Texas shows up.

Sora:
Do you think she's doing it to help Texas?

Croissant:
Lookin' at the scoreboard, Texas sure as sunshine got her name cleared. But ain't that kinda strange, whichever way ya look at it?

Sora:
Yes. I'm sure she has her own goals.

Croissant:
Gaaah, I don't have what it takes to deal with that woman.

Croissant:
Anyways, she ain't no friend of Texas, don't take a genius to know that much. But her attitude ain't much like an enemy, neither.

Croissant:
End of the day, I just can't figure out for the life of me what it is she wants outta Texas.

Exusiai:
But, the mille-feuille she gave me earlier was really good.

Croissant:
Don't wanna hear nothin' outta that hungry mouth of yours.

Exusiai:
It's kind of like how I used to look at Mostima. I couldn't figure her out, but after I gradually stopped thinking about her, she actually started to make sense to me.

Exusiai:
I feel like it's the same with Lappland.

Exusiai:
For people like her, there's no point trying to guess at what they're thinking. It's better to just accept what they say at face value.

Exusiai:
Only if every word they say is true can you start to figure if they're ultimately trying to weave truths into a lie.

Sora:
Hmm...

Croissant:
Time for me to get some chow. Exusiai, you watch over things, okay?

Exusiai:
You got it~

Caterina:
Sora, are you practicing your lines again?

Sora:
Oh, hi there, Miss Caterina.

Sora:
We're about to start our performance of Act II of 'La Morte di Texas,' so I have to step it up.

Caterina:
Oh, I completely forgot. Time sure has a way of sneaking up on you.

Caterina:
Exusiai, would you like some pizza?

Exusiai:
Sure would!

Sora:
By the way, Miss Caterina, since you're the playwright, you'll be coming to watch the show, right?

Caterina:
Hmm...

Caterina:
I actually wanted to tell you that I'm going away for a while.

Sora:
Huh?

Sora:
For how long?

Caterina:
Well... It shouldn't be too long, if everything goes as planned.

Caterina:
Don't worry, it's nothing major. Something happened back home, and as the eldest daughter, I have to go back and get everything under control.

Exusiai:
Being a big sister is hard work, isn't it?

Caterina:
Haha. It's not so bad.

Caterina:
Unfortunately, I'm still not sure what to do for the climax of Act III.

Caterina:
*sigh*... Maybe I can find some inspiration back home this time.

Sora:
Alright...

Caterina:
Come on, don't look at me like that. We just won't be seeing each other for a bit. I should still be able to find the time to come watch Act II.

Caterina:
Who knows, maybe I'll surprise you backstage and invite you out.

Sora:
Really?

Caterina:
After all, I rarely get to make new friends, and I wouldn't want to miss the performance of a script I wrote myself.

Sora:
Right. That settles it then. If you're coming by, you have to let me know!

Caterina:
Of course!

Caterina:
I'm off then. Goodbye.

Sora:
Bye bye~

Exusiai:
See you later~

Wallach:
Donna, you didn't bring any luggage?

Giovanna:
After we're done here, I have to head back to finish my script. What's there for me to bring?

Wallach:
Alright.

Giovanna:
How have the Saluzzos and Bellones been reacting?

Wallach:
The Saluzzos invited Leontuzzo to a banquet, and the old wolf Bernardo agreed to it.

Wallach:
That banquet may end up very interesting, and everyone has eyes on it now.

Wallach:
Should we respond in any way?

Giovanna:
......

Giovanna:
Wallach, help me make some travel plans.

Giovanna:
I'm going to go watch the opening performance of 'La Morte di Texas' Act II.

Wallach:
Is the script you wrote that important to you?

Giovanna:
Of course. It is the product of my painstaking labor.

Giovanna:
Also, didn't you just ask how we were going to respond?

Giovanna:
That is my response, seeing how Bernardo Bellone is about to step away from his own theater.

Giovanna:
Naturally, I, Giovanna Rossati, ought to return.
