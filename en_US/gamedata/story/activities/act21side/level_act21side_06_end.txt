Rossati Mafioso:
Back up, this one's tricky.

Rossati Mafioso:
Don't fight her head on.

Rossati Mafioso:
Cover the aisles and the stairs leading up to the Donna's box!

Lappland:
Tsk, tsk. Rossati soldiers are pretty capable after all, huh.

Lappland:
Looks like trying to brute force my way through isn't a realistic option.

Lappland:
Hmm...

Texas:
......

Lappland:
Haha, silly Texas. It's pretty obvious she's got a recorder in that bass.

Lappland:
Sounds convincing, though, the way she's plucking those strings.

Lappland:
Hm?

Lappland:
Haha, there it is.

Lappland:
If I can't break through the front... I'll just have to make a path!

Rossati Mafioso:
Don't panic!

Rossati Mafioso:
Stand your ground!

Bellone Mafioso:
Gah, aren't you afraid to die?

Rossati Mafioso:
Guh... Urgh...

Demetri:
How are the others doing?

Bellone Mafioso:
The aisles and stairs leading to Giovanna's box are all guarded.

Bellone Mafioso:
They were ready for this.

Demetri:
Leave it to the Rossatis...

Demetri:
But, we've never been ones to underestimate Giovanna.

Demetri:
Throw more soldiers at them. We're not letting Giovanna out today.

Wallach:
You might not have underestimated Giovanna, but don't you think you underestimated me?

Bellone Mafioso:
What—

Demetri:
You're... Wallach.

Wallach:
Heh, had I known the show today would've been so exciting, I wouldn't have gone to buy a drink for the Donna.

Demetri:
If Signora Giovanna appreciates a fine wine, I happen to have a selection with me.

Wallach:
No thanks.

Wallach:
The Donna enjoys many things about Siracusa, but the wine isn't one.

Wallach:
Siracusan wines are too weak, same as you people swing your weapons. Doesn't make for a good time.

Demetri:
Maybe you just haven't tried the best Siracusa has to offer.

Wallach:
So, isn't this a great opportunity?

Wallach:
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this?

Wallach:
Bellones and Saluzzos, let's find out what Siracusa's finest wine really tastes like.

Rossati Mafioso:
Trying to get up this way?

Rossati Mafioso:
Stop her!

Lappland:
Who said I was going up?

Rossati Mafioso:
What? Explosives?!

Rossati Mafioso:
Get outta there!

Croissant:
Woah, the seats over yonder just collapsed!

Exusiai:
Is that... Lappland?!

Horrified Audience:
Look over there!

Rossati Mafioso:
Urgh...

Horrified Audience:
I-Is it another famiglie gang war...?

Texas:
Move.

Rossati Mafioso:
Sh-She had weapons in her instrument?!

Sora:
Texas!

Texas says nothing. She only shoots her a glance, parting her lips for a second before rushing up the stairs.

Sora reads those lips.

She said: 'Wait for me.'

Panicked Audience:
Aaaaaahhh—! Run! Run for it!

Croissant:
What'cha think we oughta do, Exusiai? Sora's in danger!

Exusiai:
But—

Horrified Audience:
S-Someone, save me—

Exusiai:
Get down!

Exusiai:
Woah, you're pretty tough for an old guy.

???:
Do I look that old to you?

Exusiai:
Uhh... Well, I guess I wouldn't go that far.

???:
Looks like today's performance is not 'La Morte di Texas,' but rather 'La Morte di Rossati.'

???:
Find somewhere to hide, children.

Exusiai:
That sounds nice, but our friend is still up there on stage.

Croissant:
It's a gat-danged hurricane all 'round the thing! We can't just go hoppin' on into that!

Exusiai:
Let's go backstage then!

Croissant:
Okay!

Exusiai:
C'mon, outta my way!

Croissant:
Huh?

???:
Go, brave children.

Exusiai:
Thanks, old man!

Exusiai:
I'll buy you a slice later!

Croissant:
Thank ya kindly!

???:
Haha, kids these days are so full of pep.

???:
What's your plan now, Giovanna?

Rossati Mafioso:
Donna Giovanna, we've got everything locked down. Let's get you out, while we still can.

Giovanna:
Why?

Giovanna:
It's a rare opportunity to watch a wonderful show from a fantastic seat. I'm going to have to savor this.

Giovanna:
Sora, you really are her true friend, aren't you?

Giovanna:
Now, how are you going to get up here, Cellinia?

Giovanna:
Even if you find a shortcut, getting to me won't be easy.

Rossati Mafioso:
But—

Giovanna:
If I were to run away right now, do you think the Bellones and Saluzzos would just give up and call it quits?

Giovanna:
This is a war now, my dear.

Giovanna:
The Bellones and Saluzzos have decided to Signora Sicilia's ban on violence, and started a gang war.

Giovanna:
Spread the word. There's only one thing we can do now: fight to the end.

Rossati Mafioso:
Of course.

Demetri:
Nngh...

Wallach:
Looks like 'fine Siracusan wine' was nothing special after all.

Demetri:
I wouldn't gloat just yet... Columbian scum...

Demetri:
What—

Wallach:
Yes, I know. You Siracusans think the Columbian famiglie are just rowdy upstarts who haven't paid our dues.

Wallach:
And yeah, there are a whole lot of incompetent idiots over in Columbia.

Wallach:
But what about you?

Wallach:
Can you even sniff out the scent of blood under your so-called 'guns and order?'

Wallach:
We've never looked down on Siracusa.

Wallach:
But from what I've seen today, you don't even deserve my attention.

Rossati Mafioso:
Wallach, we've got a situation at the theater!

Rossati Mafioso:
Someone blew the seats, and Cellinia is heading straight for the third floor.

Wallach:
......

Wallach:
You've got five seconds for your last words.

Demetri:
Last words?

Demetri:
Heh, what's there to say?

Demetri:
If you're really gonna do it, then tell Leontuzzo that I'm sorry.

Wallach:
Sure.

Wallach:
What—

Demetri:
Leon?!

Demetri:
You...

Leontuzzo:
I'll handle this my way, Demetri.

Wallach:
Signor Leontuzzo. Here I thought we could get along.

Leontuzzo:
You just lost your last chance for that.

Wallach:
Well, well, well. Turns out the heir to a great famiglia just oozes charisma after all.

Wallach:
You've made a fool of me, and still you tell me I had a chance to make things right.

Leontuzzo:
What's done is done.

Leontuzzo:
I'll make you a bet, Wallach.

Wallach:
You're a betting man?

Wallach:
Hahahaha! Signor Leon, mio amico, we're not in a dining hall or one of our offices.

Wallach:
We're in a war, and only one of us walking out of this alive.

Leontuzzo:
Trust me, you'll love this one.

Bellone Mafioso:
Ugh, these Rossatis are a pain in the ass.

Bellone Mafioso:
Your Honor? We never heard you were joining us on this one.

Bellone Mafioso:
And anyway, this ain't something you can just walk into.

Lavinia:
I'm not here to stop you. I'm not interested.

Lavinia:
I'm looking for someone.

Bellone Mafioso:
Who?

Bellone Mafioso:
We got one helluva mess here. Not gonna be easy to find anybody.

Lavinia:
All I need from you is to stay out of my way.

Bellone Mafioso:
But...

Lavinia:
Even if I die here, that's none of Famiglia Bellone's business.

Bellone Mafioso:
Suit yourself then.

Lavinia:
There you are.

Rossati Mafioso:
Hold it.

Carwash Worker:
I work here.

Rossati Mafioso:
Uh huh. We got rid of all the workers.

Lavinia:
Grr, what is <i>he</i> doing here?

Lavinia:
Look out, Dan—

Blood splatters, and a few drops splash across Lavinia's face.

Carwash Worker:
Signorina Lavinia.

Carwash Worker:
What are you doing here?

Texas:
......

The 'path' opened by Lappland is doing its job. Only a short distance separates her from her old friend.

She lets out a soft sigh.

Chaos swirls all around her, but she knows what to do.

Wallach:
I knew you'd come, Cellinia.

Texas:
......

Wallach:
What a look in your eyes there. It's like I'm the prey.

Wallach:
Let's see what the Last Texas can do!

Rubio:
Signor, Director... is this chaos... part of the show?

Bernardo:
Chaos?

Bernardo:
In my opinion, Segretario Rubio, everything is in perfect order.

Bernardo:
What comes next will be even better.

Rubio:
...I see.

Rubio:
You lead one of the most prestigious troupes in Volsinii, and you've put on a play unlike any other.

Bernardo:
We do have an intermission coming up, though. You may tell me what it is you want from me.

Rubio:
What I want... isn't very complicated.

Rubio:
With Carracci's death, the seat of Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici is now vacant.

Rubio:
You must be thinking about who the most suitable candidate is.

Bernardo:
I take it you've decided you're that candidate?

Rubio:
I don't think there's anyone else better suited than me.

Texas:
......

Wallach:
*cough* *cough*, *cough*, *cough*...

Wallach:
Wow... There's still mercy in you, at a time like this...

Wallach:
The Saluzzo Psycho isn't gonna finish me off?

Lappland:
I'm not interested in a pointless fight with some punk who was never taking it seriously to begin with.

Wallach:
...Hah.

Lappland:
What are you waiting for? What do you want?

Wallach:
I made a bet with someone. And I hope I lose.

Wallach looks in the direction Texas went. No one can stop her from assassinating Giovanna.

Except Giovanna herself.

There is nobody else in the empty room.

Texas immediately realizes what's happening, but it's too late. A knife is already up against her neck.

Giovanna:
Since I came to Siracusa, I've been thinking of all the different ways someone might try to kill me.

Giovanna:
But I never once thought it might be you.

Giovanna:
And I never imagined you'd let your guard down, at a time like this.

Giovanna:
Did you think that when I saw you'd, I'd give you a big hug and cry 'thank goodness, Cellinia, you're still alive?'

Giovanna:
And then we'd sit down and share a drink and catch up on everything that's happened over the last few years?

Texas:
I'm here to kill you.

Giovanna:
Great.

With that word, Giovanna drops the knife in her hand.

She wears a radiant smile on her face, her expression full of longing, as if the murderous intent from a moment ago was but a light-hearted joke.

Giovanna:
Long time no see, Cellinia.

Texas:
Long time no see, Giovanna.
