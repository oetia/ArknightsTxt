Radical Mafioso:
No one told me about this!

Loyal Mafioso:
Me neither.

Radical Mafioso:
Did she act on her own?

Alberto:
Don't worry about it.

Alberto:
I chose to let her do it.

Radical Mafioso:
Don Alberto! But why?

Alberto:
A gold coin can mean very different things in different circumstances.

Alberto:
The Bellones will not have their way.

Alberto:
What's a little smirch on our reputation, if it means we cut another piece of flesh off Bernardo?

Loyal Mafioso:
Understood.

Loyal Mafioso:
What should we do now?

Alberto:
Prepare my car. I'm going to see my daughter.

Loyal Mafioso:
Yes, Don Alberto.

Alberto:
By the way, where is Danbrown now?

Loyal Mafioso:
Danbrown? I think he's working at a carwash.

Alberto:
Give me the address.

Loyal Mafioso:
Are you calling him back?

Alberto:
I never permitted him to leave the famiglia.

Loyal Mafioso:
Understood.

Alberto:
And prepare a banquet.

Loyal Mafioso:
For...?

Alberto:
A feast for the heir to Famiglia Bellone.

Gambino:
Let me go!

Bodyguard:
We caught the assassins, thanks to Lappland's tip-off.

Bodyguard:
They've been identified as having taken part in Leontuzzo's assassination.

Lavinia:
Do you two know her?

Lappland:
Hey.

Capone:
Nothing good ever comes of dealing with you, Lappland.

Lappland:
Look on the bright side. It's not every day that you get to sit in a Siracusan cell.

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
Lock them up.

Bodyguard:
Yes, Your Honor.

Lavinia:
You were the one who waylaid Cellinia, and ordered the bombing of Carracci...

Lavinia:
Is that still your story?

Lappland:
You sure are persistent, aren't you?

Lappland:
Don't you and Bellone want to get this case closed as quickly as you can?

Lappland:
Does it matter if it was me or Texas who did it?

Lavinia:
......

Lappland:
You really should hang me, Your Honor.

Lappland:
I'm just a pawn my famiglia cast aside. Surely, you can do it.

Lappland:
Imagine the positive impact that my death will have on justice in Siracusa.

Lappland:
Isn't it worth a try?

Lavinia:
I don't know what you're planning.

Lavinia:
But I'll do exactly that, if you really are the culprit, Lappland Saluzzo.

Lavinia:
First, there's someone I have to see.

Demetri:
Welcome back, Don Bernardo.

Bernardo:
Take a break. You've been working hard.

Demetri:
Yes, Don Bernardo.

Leontuzzo:
......

Bernardo:
Not happy?

Leontuzzo:
How could I be?

Bernardo:
Come with me.

Bernardo:
There are some things that you have to know.

Leontuzzo:
Why did you bring me here?

Bernardo:
My lord.

Zaaro:
Bernardo. Are you asking me to tame your unruly cub now?

Bernardo:
He just needs to understand something.

Leontuzzo:
What are you—

Zaaro:
I am il Signore dei Lupi, cub.

Leontuzzo feels a daze at the words 'Signore dei Lupi'.

Fragments of knowledge and memory rush into his mind and take shape.

The Signori dei Lupi. Sovereign of beasts.

Beings that were never born. They have existed since time immemorial.

Zaaro is a sovereign of beasts.

He and his kind have borne witness to the path that the wolfpack tread on the wildness.

They are engaged in a killing game, guided by their own nature.

The Signori dei Lupi are immortal.

They gain no satisfaction from fighting amongst themselves, so they have set rules for their game.

Each Signore dei Lupi grooms a human to hunt the others.

These are the Fangs of the Signore dei Lupi.

The one with the last Fang standing becomes the alpha.

Leontuzzo:
Signore dei Lupi, the hunt, Fangs...

Leontuzzo:
Could it be...?

Zaaro:
Your father has been an excellent Fang.

Saluzzo Mafioso:
Rubio, Don Alberto is holding a banquet for Famiglia Bellone.

Saluzzo Mafioso:
We'll need the best food.

Rubio:
Could it really be Saluzzo?

Saluzzo Mafioso:
Rubio?

Rubio:
Oh, it's nothing.

Rubio:
Let me think... ordinary hospitality won't do when the Bellones are involved.

Rubio:
Please inform Don Alberto that it would be my honor to prepare the banquet, personally.

Rubio:
I eagerly await his response.

In Columbia, a show of kindness by a mafioso often results in the subject becoming a chip in a bargain.

The more one cares, the higher the cost.

In Siracusa, the subject may take their last breath on a dark, rainy street.

The more one cares, the greater the pain.

One must become cold and heartless.

Texas knows that well, and detests it.

Lavinia:
I'm sorry.

Texas:
No need to apologize to me.

Lavinia:
You can leave after some paperwork, if you want.

Lavinia:
Procedurally, you're no longer a suspect.

Texas:
I'm not worried. It's quieter here in jail.

Texas:
Haven't you given up yet?

Lavinia:
Do you really think your old friend did it?

Texas:
......

Texas:
It's her style, but I don't see the motive.

Lavinia:
Then it's not time to give up.

Bellone Mafioso:
Signorina Lavinia, Famiglia Rossati sends word that Signor Wallach would like to speak with Signorina Cellinia.

Texas:
Well... no rest for the wicked, then.

Lavinia realizes that Texas put something in her pocket as she passed by.

She reaches into it and finds a note.

There is a phone number and a short message scribbled in a corner:

'Penguin Logistics delivers, rain or shine.'

Unhappy Audience Member:
Signor, if you have to sleep, can you at least put your legs down?

???:
...Hmm?

Carwash Worker:
Are you talking to me?

Unhappy Audience Member:
Who else? How could you sleep in the theater?

Unhappy Audience Member:
And to put your feet up like that! How rude!

Carwash Worker:
I'm not blocking you, am I?

Unhappy Audience Member:
No, but it's really off-putting to have someone so rude beside me!

Carwash Worker:
Alright, I'll put my legs down.

Unhappy Audience Member:
Hey, why do you have food with you?

Theater Manager:
We don't sell food here.

Carwash Worker:
Yeah, I bought it at the corner store, since you don't sell popcorn here.

Theater Manager:
Is it your first time here?

Carwash Worker:
A friend suggested I come here to relax.

Theater Manager:
What do you think of the performance?

Carwash Worker:
I don't really understand what's going on.

Carwash Worker:
Why are they doing that?

Theater Manager:
......

Theater Manager:
Escort this gentleman out.

Theater Manager:
He's not welcome here.

Carwash Worker:
Hey, I bought a ticket!

Theater Manager:
Give him a refund.

Flippant Security Guard:
Right away.

Flippant Security Guard:
Come with us, signor.

Flippant Security Guard:
And get the hell out.

Harsh Security Guard:
Say, I saw him when the show started.

Harsh Security Guard:
I thought he was some rich boy out to experience society.

Harsh Security Guard:
Turns out it was a poor cazzo who knows nothing about opera.

Carwash Worker:
Did you like what they were doing on stage?

Flippant Security Guard:
Of course. The actors looked nice.

Flippant Security Guard:
And the songs were beautiful.

Carwash Worker:
Is that what they call 'art'?

Flippant Security Guard:
Stick to the bars, pleb.

Flippant Security Guard:
Oh yeah, here's your ticket money.

Flippant Security Guard:
Don't you dare say we took it.

Flippant Security Guard:
What's that? You wanna do this the hard way?

Flippant Security Guard:
Hey, this guy's strong.

Flippant Security Guard:
I need some help here!

Harsh Security Guard:
......

Harsh Security Guard:
Something's not right with his eyes.

Flippant Security Guard:
A-Aaaahh! My arm! It's gonna break!

Carwash Worker:
......

Flippant Security Guard:
H-Hold it right there!

Harsh Security Guard:
Just let it go, don't waste your time with a cazzo like that.

Harsh Security Guard:
C'mon, let's get you bandaged up.

Carwash Worker:
Sorry, Signorina Lavinia...

Carwash Worker:
Doesn't look like this is something for me.

Carwash Worker:
Guess I should find a bar to get myself drunk, then spend the night at the porno theater.

???:
Want a drink?

Carwash Worker:
...?

Danbrown looks in the direction the voice came from.

He sees a man leaning by the side of the alley, shaking a bottle in his hand.

Alberto:
I want an explanation, Lappland.

Lappland:
Isn't this what you wanted?

Lappland:
Help the Bellones when they're at their weakest, control them, and dominate them, rather than destroy them.

Alberto:
I thought I taught you.

Alberto:
I taught you what to do in times like this.

Lappland:
Oh, I forgot. It's been years since I left, you know.

Alberto:
I can have you ignoring the business I give you, or you going against me.

Alberto:
You're my daughter, after all.

Alberto:
I'm a forgiving man, but I can't let you go over my head to make decisions for the famiglia.

Alberto:
Even if you did actually guess what I wanted to do.

Alberto:
I am don of our famiglia.

Alberto:
Seven years ago, I kicked you out for this. Seven years later, you came back and did it again.

Alberto:
You knew it would infuriate me. You knew it was the only thing that could infuriate me.

Alberto:
Why did you do it, figlia mia?

Lappland:
Because nothing else brings me joy, padre mio.

Lappland:
I wanted to know if it's really your position that matters most.

Lappland:
I've always wanted to know.

Lappland raises herself from the ground with great effort.

Her face is full of joy, as though this was what she came back to Siracusa for.

Mafioso:
Time's up, boss.

Alberto:
That'll be all for today.

Lappland:
That's all?

Alberto:
You defied me.

Alberto:
But you're still my daughter.

Alberto:
You know what I want, better than anyone.

Alberto:
All you're missing is discipline.

Alberto:
It's my fault for not educating you properly.

Alberto:
But there's still time.

Leontuzzo:
So all the Signori dei Lupi live amongst us?

Bernardo:
No, he's the only one who involves himself in human society.

Bernardo:
The rest of them stay out in the wildness.

Leontuzzo:
Why?

Bernardo:
He believes that the authority over man is a form of power.

Bernardo:
And he wants to use it to triumph over the other Signori dei Lupi.

Leontuzzo:
So he wants you to overthrow Signora Sicilia, become the de facto ruler of Siracusa, and help him win his fight with his kind?

Leontuzzo:
You, me, the entire famiglia, we're all tools to him.

Leontuzzo:
Did you think I was going to accept that?

Leontuzzo:
How could you accept being a puppet your entire life?!

Bernardo:
Figlio mio, there's one thing you've misunderstood.

Bernardo:
He taught me how to win power, just as I taught you.

Bernardo:
Using it to defeat the other Fangs is just a part.

Bernardo:
Every decision that I made, including what I'm doing now, is my own.

Leontuzzo:
......

Leontuzzo:
(No, he's serious.)

Leontuzzo:
(Look at him, the strength of his character, he's no puppet.)

Bernardo:
We're each other's tools, instruments for our mutual victory. That's all.

Mafioso:
Boss, the Saluzzos have sent their invitation.

Mafioso:
Don Alberto would like Signor Leon to attend his banquet.

Sora:
Sigh.

Exusiai:
I've lost count of how many times you sighed today, Sora.

Croissant:
Can't be helped, considering what happened at the trial.

Exusiai:
How about we raid the prison?

Croissant:
Ya lost yer darned mind?

Exusiai:
At least we'd get to see her.

Caterina:
I wouldn't recommend it.

Sora:
What are you doing here, Miss Caterina?

Caterina:
That's my line, Sora. Why are you out here? It's dangerous.

Sora:
I live nearby.

Caterina:
You do? Did you get scammed?

Croissant:
It's fine, she's got me n' Exusiai.

Exusiai:
Who's this, Sora?

Sora:
Oh, I met Caterina a few days ago over at the theater.

Caterina:
Well... I guess it's fine, if you have friends you can count on.

Sora:
What about you?

Caterina:
Oh, don't worry about me. A noisy place like this is conductive to my creative work.

Sora:
Creative work... say, the playwright behind La Morte di Texas is named Caterina too. Could you be...?

Caterina:
Uh-huh.

Sora:
Wow! No wonder you knew so much about the Texas Family!

Croissant:
I read that one! Even I could tell it's one humdinger of a script!

Croissant:
Can I get yer autograph?

Caterina:
Sure. Not that it's worth anything right now.

Croissant:
Le Morty de Texas is gonna be a blockbuster! You'n bet on that!

Caterina:
Thanks.

Sora:
Back to what you just said...

Caterina:
You look like you can take care of yourselves, and I wouldn't put it past you to actually get it done, if it was any other Siracusan prison.

Caterina:
But things aren't so easy here in Volsinii, with Lavinia around.

Caterina:
The eyes of all the famiglie are on that place. You don't know what trouble you might stir up, if you act rashly.

Croissant:
Heh, we were just kiddin' around.

Caterina:
You didn't look like you were.

Caterina:
May I ask a question?

Sora:
Okay?

Caterina:
Do you know Cellinia well?

Ben:
Sit.

Carwash Worker:
......

Ben:
There's an unwritten rule in art and writing.

Ben:
You can base your work on the famiglia, but you can't mention a real famiglia by name.

Carwash Worker:
I've heard that.

Ben:
But somebody put 'La Morte di Texas' out there.

Ben:
The first work to use the name of a real famiglia.

Carwash Worker:
And?

Ben:
That means the famiglie aren't trying to stay in the shadows anymore. They're out to take center stage.

Ben:
All thanks to the Columbians.

Ben:
A lot's changed since the Columbians got mixed up in the Siracusan art scene.

Ben:
Unscrupulous artists—or rather, craftsmen—pumped out work that's starting to stink.

Ben:
They're not making observations about life, they're making pale imitations of it. As long as audiences are willing to shell out money for it.

Ben:
It's just a mosaic of pop culture. What was popular yesterday shows up in theaters tomorrow.

Ben:
Real quality is buried under garbage, which becomes all you find when you look for art.

Ben:
Isn't that terrible?

Carwash Worker:
If it's what everybody likes, then what you call 'art' sounds like garbage.

Ben:
Some think like that, but not everyone.

Ben:
There are those who would like to keep good art from being buried, but they don't know how to fight the tide.

Carwash Worker:
That old timey opera didn't appeal to me.

Ben:
But you never escaped the past, did you?

Carwash Worker:
Who are you?

Ben:
Benthonexigios. You'll find my name in the reviews section of Volsinii Arts Weekly.

Carwash Worker:
Ben...

Ben:
Just call me Ben.

Carwash Worker:
Ben...

Carwash Worker:
I... I've got my thoughts about what Siracusa's become.

Carwash Worker:
People up high say we oughta solve our problems in more civilized ways.

Carwash Worker:
But when I try to do something all civilized, things turn out the same as they always did.

Carwash Worker:
Why do we fool ourselves like that, when we don't actually have to?

Ben:
The famiglie know how things are trending, but no one wants to give what they already had.

Ben:
Want a drink?

Carwash Worker:
That wine's not cheap.

Ben:
It's not.

Carwash Worker:
And this is a cheap pizzeria.

Ben:
It is.

Carwash Worker:
Why pair a wine like that with pizza like <i>that?</i>

Ben:
Because the wine is worth the same as the pizza to me.

Ben:
The wine is certainly finely made, but just as much care was put into growing the wheat that ended up in this pizza.

Ben:
Is there really that much of a difference in value between them, if you take away the trappings of civilization?

Ben:
Do you believe in these things?

Carwash Worker:
The trappings of civilization?

Ben:
Like the label on this wine. Slap it on something, and you're free to feed on the people whom you've fooled.

Caterina:
So Cellinia fled to Lungmen, and you are her friends...

Sora:
Hard to believe, isn't it?

Caterina:
No, I believe it.

Sora:
Really?

Caterina:
First, there's no need for you to lie. Second, I always thought there was a chance she was still alive.

Caterina:
Now I understand why she suddenly showed up.

Caterina:
I guess she made a deal with the Bellones, and now she's here to pay her debt.

Sora:
Definitely sounds like her.

Caterina:
But what a coincidence it is that you found the Compagnia dell'alba... (whispers) or perhaps it's no coincidence...

Sora:
What's special about that company?

Caterina:
Nothing. It's nothing.

Caterina:
The Compagnia dell'alba is a good place to start, if you want to get close to Famiglia Bellone.

Caterina:
But... well, come with me.

Exusiai:
What's this place...?

Caterina:
It's my home.

Croissant:
Wow, books and papers everywhere.

Caterina:
Haha, sorry about that. I didn't have time to clean up.

Caterina:
Take this, Sora.

Sora:
A key?

Caterina:
Yes. It can be dangerous outside. Come here, if you want to practice.

Caterina:
It's quieter, and I have plenty of scripts you can look at.

Sora:
But...

Caterina:
Just think of it as making a new friend.

Sora:
Alright!
