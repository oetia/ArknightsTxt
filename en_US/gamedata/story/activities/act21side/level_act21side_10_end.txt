Leontuzzo:
Didn't the Signori dei Lupi agree not to meddle in the affairs of mortals?

Zaaro:
I changed my mind. Bernardo ruined my plans!

Zaaro:
I spent sixty-eight years grooming him.

Zaaro:
And now he's killed himself just to deny my victory!

Leontuzzo:
Wh-What did you say?

Leontuzzo:
My father... killed himself?

His father's interpretation of the Signori dei Lupi and the game flash through Leontuzzo's mind.

He suddenly understands that the words his father spoke to him in the church were a kind of approval for him...

And his last words.

His father had planned to take his own life all along.

Zaaro:
The price for insulting the Signori dei Lupi is a heavy one.

Zaaro:
He may dead, but I won't stop until his bloodline is ended.

Zaaro:
Son of Bernardo, you will pay for the sins of your father!

Zaaro:
The price is his bloodline and your life!

Leontuzzo:
......

Leontuzzo:
Price?

Leontuzzo:
Did you say 'price?'

Leontuzzo:
My father may have been wrong, but his dream was always about bringing change to the times.

Leontuzzo:
He wanted a Siracusa without the famiglie, and spent his entire life planning it.

Leontuzzo:
I thought his own family was a chip to him.

Leontuzzo:
I thought he acted when he did because it was the right time.

Leontuzzo:
But now I know.

Leontuzzo:
He decided he was out of time. This was his only chance to get revenge on you and achieve his dream.

Zaaro:
I taught him everything he knew! He repaid me with betrayal!

Leontuzzo:
You wouldn't understand.

Leontuzzo:
Signore dei Lupi on high, thinking everything under his control.

Leontuzzo:
To father, even his own life was just another chip.

Leontuzzo:
He was determined to make his dream come true, even if it meant paying the ultimate price.

Leontuzzo:
But you're the one who will pay!

Zaaro:
Ignorant whelp!

Exusiai:
Welcome back, Texas!

Exusiai:
Are you done over there?

Texas:
Yeah.

Texas:
Time to clean up the trouble over here.

Zaaro:
The last Texas.

Zaaro:
Do not forget who permitted you to break from Siracusa.

Zaaro:
How dare you defy me?!

Texas:
I kept my bargain with Bernardo. I owe you nothing.

Zaaro:
Fool!

Lavinia:
Bernardo killed himself?

Lavinia:
Why?

Bernardo:
The game is over, Lavinia.

Lavinia:
So that's what you really meant...

Lavinia:
A Siracusa without the famiglie. That was your true dream.

Lavinia:
Why didn't you tell me?

Lappland:
Try to keep your head in the fight, Judgie.

Lavinia:
Lappland—

Lappland:
Why didn't you tell me you were throwing a party, Texas?

Texas:
You would've come anyway.

Lappland:
Yeah, you're right.

Zaaro:
Get lost, cub without a pack. There's no place for you here.

Lappland:
Let me tell you some good news, Signore dei Lupi, Figlio dei Lupi, whatever you are.

Lappland:
Starting now, everything Siracusan is my enemy.

Lappland:
Even supernatural beings like you.

Zaaro:
Idiot!

Demetri:
What about you, boss? If you were there, looking me in the eye, would you tell me without a doubt, that you choose your dreams, like Leon?

Demetri:
I mean... I don't know the answer anymore.

Lunacub:
Stay focused, if you don't want to die.

Demetri:
You're—

Zaaro:
The feeble Fang of Agnese.

Zaaro:
Did you think yourself worthy to stand before me just because you caught a glimpse of the death of my Fang?

Lunacub:
I promised Bernardo that I'd help his kin.

Zaaro:
Agnese has raised a feeble Fang.

Zaaro:
It's time to put an end to her part in this game.

Zaaro:
You cannot destroy me, no matter what you do.

Zaaro:
You cannot even harm me.

Zaaro:
Humans built cities, trapped themselves within, and think themselves the masters of the lands beneath them.

Zaaro:
Do not presume to have risen because you learned to use a few tools.

Zaaro:
You have never conquered the wastes.

Emperor:
Ladies and gentleman.

Emperor:
You stand in the presence of the Emperor, Lungmen's superstar!

Texas:
Boss?!

Emperor:
Lemme take this chance to remind you your vacation's almost up, Texas.

Texas:
Why are you here?

Emperor:
You askin' me?

Emperor:
Sora and the girls ran off after you.

Emperor:
You know what the past month's been like for me?

Emperor:
I ain't been this bored in three thousand years!

Emperor:
I got nobody to party with!

Texas:
......

Zaaro:
Emperor—

Emperor:
Hold it, Zaaro.

Emperor:
You gonna say I got no business in Siracusa. It ain't my right to stick my flipper in here.

Emperor:
Honestly, I don't give a shit.

Emperor:
But, if I think on it, I'm gonna pass on some dumbass fight with you...

Emperor:
Beatin' you at your own game, that'd make me happier.

Emperor:
So—

Shadow after shadow emerges from beneath Emperor's feet and takes corporeal form.

Zaaro knows them, of course. They are the Signori dei Lupi who have lost in this round.

They are here for one reason.

He broke the rules.

They can accept how he played, but they will not permit the rules to be broken.

Emperor:
Look, I brought the other Wolf Lords. They bored too.

Emperor:
Lemme give you the good news.

Emperor:
You're a loser.

Emperor:
In pretty much every way a man can be a loser.

The Signori dei Lupi are immortal, but over the long years, they have long learned how to contain, suppress, even torment each other.

Against so many beings of his kind, Zaaro knows that resistance is futile.

After a moment of silence, he lowers his proud head.

Emperor:
Tell ya the truth, Zaaro?

Emperor:
Your whole thing, the way you talk about power, the way you play with it, gives me the heebie-jeebies.

Emperor:
The way you stew in your anger, lookin' to tear everything in your way to pieces...

Emperor:
<i>That's</i> what shows you still true to your nature.

Emperor:
But all you wolves, don't you get bored playin' a dumbass game like this for thousands of years?

Emperor:
You oughta come to Lungmen. I'll teach ya to play poker.

Emperor:
Or mahjong. Mahjong ain't bad.

Zaaro ignores Emperor's jabs.

He takes one last, long look at Leontuzzo, then his silhouette becomes less and less distinct, until he fades away completely in the wind.

It is as though he never existed.

Texas:
Thanks, Boss.

Emperor:
Don't thank me.

Emperor:
Someone woulda done somethin', even if it wasn't me.

Emperor:
She just delegated the job. Didn't ya, sexy?

Signora Sicilia:
It's been a long time since anyone called me 'sexy.'

Signora Sicilia:
You're welcome to spend some time enjoying Siracusa, if you like.

Emperor:
Just call me Emperor.

Signora Sicilia:
Interesting name. You're not arrogant or ignorant, like the Signori dei Lupi, Siracusa welcomes you, Emperor.

Emperor:
I think Siracusa's gonna like me.

Leontuzzo:
Signora Sicilia!

Signora Sicilia:
The games of the Signori dei Lupi are archaic and stupid.

Signora Sicilia:
Leontuzzo, son of Bernardo.

Signora Sicilia:
Rest assured, he'll never trouble you again.

Leontuzzo:
...!

Leontuzzo cannot move an inch.

He realizes that everything ended the moment the old woman appeared.

Not just the game of the Signori dei Lupi, but their resistance as well.

The old woman before him looks kind and cordial, but he knows that he will die in the most painful way possible, if he makes one wrong move.

He also knows, however, that to back down now is to see all his effort, all that he believes in, fade into dream.

He looks over at Lavinia and sees the same thought in her eyes.

Leontuzzo:
Pardon me, Signora Sicilia. I didn't expect to have the honor of your presence in this way.

Leontuzzo:
You may already know what happened. You may already have made your decision.

Leontuzzo:
But I hope you'll give me and Lavinia a chance.

Signora Sicilia:
A chance. What kind of chance?

Lavinia:
A chance to talk.

Leontuzzo:
Even if we're doomed to die, I hope you'll grant us an audience before that happens.

Signora Sicilia:
......

Signora Sicilia:
Ah.

Signora Sicilia:
Agenir always says I should listen to the youths more.

Signora Sicilia:
I think he overestimates his age.

Signora Sicilia:
Come with me, children. You have earned the chance.

Lavinia:
May I have a moment first?

Signora Sicilia:
Hm?

Lavinia:
I would like to take one last look at Bernardo.

Signora Sicilia:
Alright.

Sora:
Exusiai! Texas!

Croissant:
You okay?!

Exusiai:
We're fine.

Texas:
...Yeah.

Texas:
What are you doing here?

Sora:
I was too worried. Giovanna's stable now, so I brought Croissant.

Croissant:
Looks like everything's more-or-less hunky-dory over here, though?

Texas:
I guess so.

Exusiai:
Whew... it still feels like something's missing, but I guess we can throw our party now?

Texas:
Yeah.

Texas:
You guys decide what kind of party you want.

Sora:
Where are you going, Texas?

Texas:
Toilet.

Lappland:
Toilet isn't that way.

Texas:
I know.

Lappland:
Feel a weight off your shoulders? Like you just got over a hill?

Texas:
There's still big trouble waiting, right there.

Lappland:
Ha. Shall we go?

Texas:
We'll go.

Lappland:
By the way, Texas.

Lappland:
I got a letter from Signora Sicilia before you went back to Siracusa.

Texas:
Cool.

Lappland:
Guess what it said?

Texas:
No thanks.

Lappland:
Oh, you're no fun. Signora Sicilia invited me to join the Bocca al Lupo.

Texas:
Bocca al Lupo...

Lappland:
Basically, become one of her wolves.

Lappland:
So I burned the letter.

Lappland:
I figured I was gonna get some Siracusans giving me trouble for a while.

Lappland:
Then you went back to Siracusa, all of a sudden.

Lappland:
Do you have any idea how surprised I was when I realized you were gone?

Texas:
*sigh*...

Lappland:
So you've made up your mind?

Texas:
Yes.

Texas:
I'll stay and help Lavinia and Leontuzzo.

Texas:
What about you?

Lappland:
I've made up my mind too.

Texas:
I heard you made a hell of a scene with your own famiglia.

Lappland:
I just went to say goodbye to my father.

Lappland:
Texas... Do you really not get what I see in you?

Texas:
Sometimes I think I do.

Texas:
Sometimes I think I don't.

Texas:
All I know is that you seem to have gotten over something.

Lappland:
Oh? Are you showing concern for me?

Texas:
I just think you're kind of annoying.

The pair were walking side-by-side, but now they head to opposite ends of the clearing, as if by some silent agreement.

Lappland:
At the end of the day, we have to do this.

Texas:
I guess so.

Lappland:
Do you remember?

Lappland:
Seven years ago, you came to me, in front of the burning mansion, looking to get away from it all.

Lappland:
I got hell for it that day.

Lappland:
Seven years later, you came to me again, in a rainy park, to issue a silly challenge to Siracusa.

Lappland:
I'll kill you today.

Texas:
That's my line.

The sound of weapons clashing fills the park.

No tricks, no fooling around. Every attack is intended to kill.

Lappland:
You could call me your past, Texas.

Lappland:
I believed that no one could escape this swamp.

Lappland:
You escaped your past, once, and made up your mind to cut all ties with it, after returning to Siracusa.

Lappland:
You proved to everyone that you had what it took to escape the swamp.

Lappland:
You're staying here of your own accord, to help that young cub change the place.

Texas:
You're giving me too much credit.

Texas:
My dream has always been to live a simple life with a few good friends.

Texas:
I'll defend it, if someone threatens to destroy it.

Texas:
There's nothing complicated about it.

Giovanna:
I never truly knew you, Cellinia.

Giovanna:
I didn't realize how Siracusa exhausted you, or how you resented Columbia.

Giovanna:
Now that I think about it, I was like my grandma.

Giovanna:
She spent her entire life hoping that old Salvadore would change his mind.

Giovanna:
But she never even asked, never tried to fight for it.

Giovanna:
The same for me. I assumed the good times would last forever.

Giovanna:
I was so proud, and arrogant.

Giovanna:
You wouldn't mind me staying with you, and I would love to chat more with Sora.

Giovanna:
But I don't deserve that. Not yet.

Giovanna:
And so, let me close the curtains on Act 3 of <i>La Morte di Texas,</i> on Cellinia Texas's story.

Giovanna:
You're free, Cellinia.

Giovanna:
No one defines you.

Lappland:
So let me put it a different way.

Lappland:
You're my nightmare, Texas.

Lappland:
You always surprise me.

Lappland:
You're always a step ahead of me.

Lappland:
You made all the decisions that I couldn't.

Lappland:
And now I can finally say this, after finally taking that step, like you did.

Lappland:
You're right.

Lappland:
There's nothing complicated about it.

Lappland:
If I hated everything about Siracusa so much, I should've destroyed it.

Lappland:
In the end, you're the one who made me take this step.

Texas:
That's why you said goodbye to your father, and why you're standing here in front of me.

Texas:
You want to settle things with your past.

Lappland:
Yes. Just like you.

Texas:
......

Texas:
We didn't have to go at each other's throats like this.

Lappland:
But it happened.

Lappland:
We each decided, on our own, that to kill each other is the way to settle things.

Lappland:
The best way to say our goodbyes.

Lappland:
The one who survives will become stronger.

Not that Lappland has become stronger than Texas, or that Texas has become weak.

Just like how Lappland did not lose to Texas seven years ago because she was weaker.

They were evenly matched from the beginning.

What determines the outcome is Lady Luck, perhaps... or more importantly, strength of will.

Seven years ago, Lappland lost the battle of wills.

But now, having said goodbye to the famiglia, her will is no weaker than Texas's.

Either may win, and either may lose.

Texas:
Ugh...

Lappland:
It's over.

Sora:
Texas!

Texas:
Stay back.

Texas takes one look at Sora, then closes her eyes.

Lappland thought she knew Texas well enough.

What did she not know?

She bore witness to Texas's exhaustion with Siracusa, and her decision to declare war on the country.

Texas's decisions surprised her each time.

But this time, she thought, it would not be so.

One lives, the other dies. There would be no other end.

But as she saw the unwillingness to let go in Texas's eyes, she once again realized that she was wrong.

At the very end, in the ending that Lappland wrote for herself, Texas has surprised her, once again.

Lappland:
Ha. Alright.

Lappland sees this battle as a farewell, a liberation.

Lose, and she will accept her death.

Win, and she will be able to let it all go.

When the pin by the name of Texas is pulled from her consciousness, a lunatic by the name of Lappland would be born.

But it never happened.

Because—

Lappland:
Texas. So you were just Texas after all.

Texas:
Of course I'm just Texas.

Texas:
What about you?

Lappland:
Looks like I'm just Lappland.

Lappland extends a hand to Texas.

Texas takes the hand.

Lappland:
Texas, am I your friend, or your enemy?

Texas:
You're my friend, and my enemy.

Lappland:
Then go.

Lappland:
Let me do what a friend should.

Texas nods to the others, and walks towards Grey Hall.

It is all so natural, as though it was always the way things should be.

When Lavinia walks into the church and sees the body sitting silently on the pew, she finally accepts the truth—

Bernardo is dead.

Lavinia:
......

She sits by the man who was both father and brother, the man who had such an impact on her life, and stays silent.

In the end, she says nothing.

But she holds Bernardo's lifeless hand, as though communicating something, or getting something from him.

Then, she turns and leaves.

The dead are dead and gone. She must move on.

Signora Sicilia:
I heard my friends talking about what you did.

Signora Sicilia:
Let me ask you one thing, child.

Signora Sicilia:
All the nations across these lands are seeking change, trying to move with the times.

Signora Sicilia:
But the impetus for change is an awareness of inadequacy, or a search for breakthrough.

Signora Sicilia:
Does Siracusa need that? Does Siracusa really need to change?

Leontuzzo:
Do you think... that the famiglia is something that must exist?

Signora Sicilia:
Nothing is. But it existed for centuries before I was born.

Signora Sicilia:
We can't deny our history, or so easily destroy what already exists, can we?

Leontuzzo:
That's why you chose to continue the famiglia system when you established Grey Hall, except now all the famiglie have to operate under your control.

Leontuzzo:
I don't intend to deny it.

Leontuzzo:
In fact, I think it was the correct decision, in its time.

Signora Sicilia:
But things are different now?

Leontuzzo:
Correct.

Leontuzzo:
The return of the Columbian famiglie brought advanced technology and philosophy.

Leontuzzo:
The Columbians are exerting an increasing influence on famiglia-style rule, but many haven't realized it.

Leontuzzo:
Some of what my father did was overly radical.

Leontuzzo:
Our motivations are different, and so are our means.

Leontuzzo:
But one thing is the same.

Leontuzzo:
We both believe that—

Leontuzzo:
Siracusa doesn't need the famiglie anymore.

Signora Sicilia:
What are you planning to do, then?

Leontuzzo:
The simplest thing would be to kill you here, or die trying.

Leontuzzo:
But that's the choice my father would have made.

Leontuzzo:
As for me...

Leontuzzo:
I would like to borrow a city.

Signora Sicilia:
An interesting proposal.

Signora Sicilia:
A new city needs new blood.

Signora Sicilia:
But you're on your own, child.

Signora Sicilia:
How am I supposed to believe that you can reach your goal?

The doors of Grey Hall are pushed open, before Signora Sicilia finished her sentence.

Signora Sicilia:
Hm?

Signora Sicilia:
Cellinia. The last Texas.

Signora Sicilia:
Come here and let me get a good look at you.

Signora Sicilia:
I see your grandfather in you.

Texas:
...Thank you.

Signora Sicilia:
Looks like Giovanna has given you the necklace that I gave her.

Signora Sicilia:
What is it you want?

Signora Sicilia:
If you want to go back to Lungmen, I guarantee that Siracusa will never disturb you again.

Texas:
......

Texas:
I want to ask you to spare Famiglia Rossati.

Signora Sicilia:
Oh? That's a surprise.

Signora Sicilia:
Wallach assassinated Giovanna, and tried to kill you many times.

Signora Sicilia:
Do you really want to spare him?

Texas:
They're only trying to survive, in their own way.

Signora Sicilia:
You can keep the necklace. I never intended to do anything to them.

Signora Sicilia:
Or, you can trade it for the right to leave Siracusa forever.

Texas:
......

Texas sits down by Leontuzzo's side.

Texas:
Don't need that. I'm extending my vacation.

Signora Sicilia:
What about you, Lappland?

Signora Sicilia:
Lone wolf, Saluzzo's traitor.

Lappland walks to Texas's side with a jesting smirk on her face.

Lappland:
Heh. I got a simple dream.

Lappland:
I wanna destroy Siracusa, just like them.

Lappland:
The difference is that I'm not as civilized.

Signora Sicilia:
And you, Judge Lavinia, instrument of my will?

Lavinia stands behind Leontuzzo.

Lavinia:
Your will was once Siracusa itself.

Lavinia:
But now, I'm going to change it.

Signora Sicilia:
You believe that I'm wrong?

Lavinia:
I believe that no one can be right forever.

Signora Sicilia casts her gaze at the four young people before her.

One who came from the strongest famiglia in Siracusa, whose upbringing made him long for a civilized future. Denied by his position, he chose to bury his head in the sand.

One who came from modest beginnings, who earned the favor of the famiglie. It filled her with doubt about herself, and so she chose to deceive herself.

One who came from the oldest famiglia in Siracusa, who hated everything that it asked of her. It drove her to rebellion, down a path of madness.

One who came from the strongest famiglia in Columbia, who became exhausted with the existence of the famiglia itself. She chose to run away in silence.

They want to change Siracusa for different reasons, but they all came together, in the end.

Signora Sicilia:
I won't live forever, but I have a few decades left.

Signora Sicilia:
Until the moment that my eyes close forever, Siracusa will continue to enjoy the peace that I bring.

Signora Sicilia:
What about you, child?

Signora Sicilia:
You stand on your father's shoulders, seeking to make the system better and fairer.

Signora Sicilia:
Do you think you chose the correct path?

Signora Sicilia:
If I gave you Siracusa, could you guarantee that she would walk a better path, and become a better country?

Leontuzzo:
...I can't guarantee that.

Leontuzzo:
But, just as you're willing to listen to me here today...

Leontuzzo:
If someone else comes along, looking to change my ways...

Leontuzzo:
I'm willing to sit down and hear him out.

Signora Sicilia smiles.

Exusiai:
You see, I don't hear any fighting. They're fine.

Sora:
You're the only one who could be so at ease like this. That's the head of state there, you know?

Texas:
Sorry for making you worry.

Sora:
It's fine.

Sora:
Huh? Where's Lappland?

Texas:
She...

Texas casts her gaze in a certain direction.

Texas:
She's fulfilled her duty as a friend. Who knows what form she'll take, when she shows herself next time?

Texas:
The only thing I can be sure is this.

Texas:
We haven't seen the last of her.

Croissant:
My head hurts just thinkin' about it.

Sora:
Never mind. Let's see how Giovanna's doing.

Texas:
Yeah.

Sora:
Giovanna, we're back!

The room is empty.

Sora's joy quickly turns to confusion.

Then, she sees a stack of paper on the desk.

It is a script.

Sora flips over the first page.

'Dedicated to my dear old friend, Cellinia.

And my new friends, Penguin Logistics.'

Sora:
The part that Giovanna was struggling with in Act 3 of <i>La Morte di Texas</i>...

Sora:
Is this what you left for us?

Sora:
You didn't have to leave.
