Bernardo:
Welcome to Teatro di Milano, signorine mie.

Sora:
Wow, this place is breathtaking!

Bernardo:
Siracusans love to kill time here to the accompaniment of music and performance. After all, when reality is monotonous and difficult to change, people naturally need a place to indulge their fantasies.

Bernardo:
Or, to equate their bloodstained business dealings with the legendary exploits of the heroes on stage to obtain a sense of moral satisfaction.

Sora:
Wow... you really don't pull any punches, huh?

Bernardo:
Of course not. In this line of work, we must be clear-eyed about our own profession, no?

Bernardo:
Your friends over there seem to have been on their guard from the very beginning.

Croissant:
I don't mean no disrespect, Mr. Director, but the way I heard it, you was callin' that play yer rehearsin'...

Bernardo:
'La Morte di Texas.'

Exusiai:
'The Death of Texas'? That might be the crappiest 'joke' I've ever heard.

Bernardo:
Hm? You seem to be well-acquainted with that name. That's fairly unusual among foreigners.

Bernardo:
Siracusans rarely bring it up in the first place, and the mafiosi here are even more secretive about it. But the story of Famiglia Texas... is one that every mafioso must always keep in their hearts.

Bernardo:
It is a cautionary tale.

Sora:
A warning...

Bernardo:
Let's talk about the script itself first. There are countless works based on the deeds of Famiglia Texas, but not a single one dares to actually print the name.

Bernardo:
Playwrights are more inclined to reimagine or adapt, with the help of allusion or parody. After all, it is against their interests to invite trouble.

Bernardo:
However, times change, and today's audience finds true history far more salient than fairy tales with falsified names. Wouldn't you agree?

Bernardo:
As such, a remarkable individual has brought this script before us.

Bernardo:
It's a play in three acts.

Bernardo:
The first act harkens back to the era when Columbia was first established, with many a Siracusan famiglia yearning for this undeveloped land.

Bernardo:
Consequently, the famiglie each dispatched their own teams, one after another, joining the ranks of Columbia's first pioneers.

Bernardo:
'In an era when chaos and opportunity came hand-in-hand, some were swallowed by the tides of the times, while others found in it their promised land.'

Bernardo:
The cream of the crop among them was Salvadore Texas, a man who would later establish his very own era.

Sora:
(I know he means the surname and not <i>her</i>, but still...)

Sora:
So, Texas is one of Siracusa's families?

Bernardo:
To be precise, they were a famiglia that originated in Siracusa, but took root in Columbia.

Bernardo:
Such famiglie are hardly unusual over there.

Bernardo:
From beginning to end, though, old Salvadore saw himself as a Siracusan, through-and-through.

Bernardo:
And the Siracusans in turn rewarded him for his perseverance, always affording him a Siracusan's respect.

Sora:
The Siracusans...

Bernardo:
The second act chronicles some of the most praiseworthy episodes from his storied struggles in Columbia.

Bernardo:
Siracusans can be found everywhere in the shadows of Columbia's history, and it is precisely amidst that tide that Salvadore gathered his famiglia.

Bernardo:
In truth, the contents of this act are the best known of the three.

Bernardo:
Even across various retellings, they're almost always the same.

Bernardo:
Accounts of 'the Siracusan in Columbia' can be found in over a dozen versions in any local bookstore, mostly romance novels borrowing the phantom of his name, so to speak.

Bernardo:
Perhaps, there may even be a few words of truth among them.

Bernardo:
If you're interested in that, I can point you to some of the less-outrageous ones.

Sora:
Ooh, I'd appreciate that!

Bernardo:
Think nothing of it. Now, onto the third act - this is the one that can change most dramatically between versions.

Sora:
Because... it deals with the fall of the Texas Family?

Bernardo:
That's right.

Bernardo:
Outsiders only know one thing for certain about the fall of Famiglia Texas, and that is that—

Bernardo:
Salvadore was murdered by his own son, Giuseppe, who later declared that Famiglia Texas would break away from Siracusa's famiglia system.

Bernardo:
This act angered Signora Sicilia, and incurred her retribution.

Bernardo:
In a single night, the Texas name was wiped from existence.

Sora:
The entire Texas family disappeared... in a single night?!

Bernardo:
At least, that's what every Siracusan believes.

Bernardo:
As far as what exactly happened during the liquidation of Famiglia Texas, nobody except the parties involved have any way of knowing.

Sora:
Excuse me... How come there are only scripts for the first two acts here?

Bernardo:
That is because the third act is not yet finished.

Bernardo:
Each playwright will invariably imagine their own version of how this process unfolded, arriving at completely different developments and outcomes.

Bernardo:
In that regard, our playwright seems to have reached an impasse.

Bernardo:
That said, the contents of the first two acts are already exceptional on their own merits, so I purchased the work without hesitation.

Sora:
Mr. Bernardo, is it possible that one of the heirs of the Texas Family survived the chaos?

Sora:
Like, maybe she... managed to leave Columbia and escape to a different city?

Sora:
For example... Lungmen?

Bernardo:
Lungmen? If I recall, that's where you ladies hail from.

Sora:
......

Bernardo:
Apparently, Salvadore did not have a particularly amicable relationship with his son.

Bernardo:
But he doted on his granddaughter, even sending her back to Siracusa, where she was fostered by Famiglia Saluzzo for several years.

Bernardo:
Nobody has seen or heard from her since the liquidation, though.

Bernardo:
In fact, nobody can conclusively say if she was even involved in this at all. Some say she's been seen in Columbia, or even along the border of Siracusa.

Bernardo:
Therefore, different accounts of Famiglia Texas's story tend to have different endings when it comes to her.

Sora:
......

Bernardo:
She was said to possess their iconic black hair and orange eyes.

Sora:
If—and I'm speaking hypothetically here! If the last descendant of the Texas Family is still alive, and has returned to Siracusan soil once again...

Sora:
What would happen then?

Bernardo:
Certainly a thought-provoking hypothetical, one with any number of possible developments. Playwrights tend to build their work around such logic.

Bernardo:
Sadly, Signorina Sora, reality does not abide by logic.

Sora:
......

Sora:
Some say that she is the 'guest' of a family by the name of Bellone.

Sora:
Some say that the Bellones are the most powerful family in the city.

Sora:
Some say that she...

Sora:
Some say that she left everything behind to go there, not even giving herself a chance to say goodbye.

Bernardo:
......

Sora:
I, no, <i>we</i> came all the way here to find her.

Bernardo:
Your bravery is commendable.

Bernardo:
Since you have been so frank with me, bringing secrets even I have never heard, allow me to be frank with you in turn.

Bernardo:
Famiglia Bellone and their guests have indeed frequented this theater, graciously offering their patronage to our humble performances.

Sora:
Really?!

Bernardo:
Call it coincidence, or call it fate. Is that not how all stories unfold?

Bernardo:
If that guest truly comes to pay us a visit, then our troupe will be sure to extend her an enthusiastic welcome.

Bernardo:
Rumor has it that she is a woman of few words, whose twin swords speak for her.

Bernardo:
Her name is... Cellinia Texas.

Leontuzzo:
......

Lavinia:
......

Leontuzzo:
Stop shoving that plate of thistles in my face, Lavinia.

Lavinia:
The seasoning here isn't as bad as you make it out to be. Give it a try.

Leontuzzo:
I'm going to have to pass again.

Lavinia:
Are you trying to save room in your stomach for a cold dinner with those smug mafiosi friends of yours back home, who reek of cigar butts?

Lavinia:
After all, only the things that happen there have any real 'value.'

Leontuzzo:
No... I just seriously can't stand artichokes.

Lavinia:
Leon, I've already lost count of the number of violent incidents that have broken out in this city over the past month.

Lavinia:
Just this morning, a citizen nearly died at this very restaurant.

Leontuzzo:
You're a judge. You should know better than anyone else that Siracusa was built on violence.

Leontuzzo:
Should there ever come a day when there aren't any unidentifiable corpses lying in the alleys, then <i>that</i> would be real news.

Lavinia:
The victim was an employee of il Ministero dei Lavori Pubblici. <i>Your</i> ministero.

Leontuzzo:
...Who did it?

Lavinia:
It would appear that Leontuzzo, son of Don Bellone deigns to inquire about the life and death of a citizen only when it concerns his career.

Leontuzzo:
Your Honor, Lavinia Falcone, I really do not have the energy to clap back at you right now.

Leontuzzo:
We can all feel that this city has been on edge recently... waiting for something big to happen.

Lavinia:
Something bigger than the Bellones' ultimate victory?

Leontuzzo:
If we really are allowed to take the reins, I, for one, do not intend to continue tolerating the thugs that prowl in the cover of darkness.

Leontuzzo:
Lavinia, you're familiar with the way I do things.

Lavinia:
I sure hope so.

Leontuzzo:
Over a hundred years ago, when Siracusa first turned from a plot of land into a country, its territory consisted of the twenty-two cities controlled by the Dodici Famiglie.

Leontuzzo:
And to this day, that number has never changed.

Lavinia:
Just like Siracusa's ironclad 'tradition.'

Lavinia:
But finally, after so many years, our ever-immutable Siracusa is about to give birth to a new nomadic city.

Leontuzzo:
A new nomadic city means new opportunities, new ambitions, and new hopes. You're exactly right, we are indeed at victory's doorstep.

Leontuzzo:
Economy, traffic, and route planning. We and our friends have already been spreading our influence through every facet of Volsinii's new urban area.

Leontuzzo:
When that area is formally built into a new city, we will have the right to lead the future of Siracusa. At least, that's what the more optimistic associates of the famiglia believe.

Lavinia:
And do you consider yourself one of those optimists?

Leontuzzo:
I very much hope I am.

Leontuzzo:
That said, the old fellas over at Grey Hall haven't reached their final decision yet.

Leontuzzo:
There's no future to look forward to until everyone there has formally let the chips fall.

Lavinia:
Are we still looking forward to the same future, Leon?

Leontuzzo:
...Of course.

Leontuzzo:
Alright, it's about time for me to head off.

Leontuzzo:
Before the banquet starts, I have to first pick up a certain... 'friend.'

Texas:
......

Texas:
This whole city is sopping wet.

Leontuzzo:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Texas:
I was just looking around.

Leontuzzo:
Celli... Signorina Texas, how do you feel about the way your hometown has changed?

Texas:
These newfangled streets and alleys? That hardly counts as 'change.'

Texas:
The way I see it, it's exactly the same as the day I left.

Texas:
And... this outfit. I don't think it's a very good idea.

Leontuzzo:
Consider it your very first gift from Famiglia Bellone. Hopefully, you'll find that our tailor has not besmirched the former glory of Famiglia Texas. Please, be at ease and accept it.

Texas:
So if I'm not at ease, can I refuse?

Leontuzzo:
Unfortunately, I'm afraid that is not an option.

Texas:
Guess I'll have to find a way to ease up then.

Texas:
So, what's my job here?

Leontuzzo:
It's very simple - you'll join me at tonight's banquet, where I'll proudly announce in front of everyone that I, the son of Don Bellone, have enlisted a bodyguard who's inherited the Texas name.

Leontuzzo:
Then, you'll kill all the overzealous, power-hungry idiots there, and we'll call it a day.

Texas:
I'd actually be down for that.

Leontuzzo:
Same. If only it were ever that easy.

Leontuzzo:
Alright, Texas. In the two days I've left you in the city, I've been hard at work conditioning my mind.

Leontuzzo:
I've been trying to tell myself that the Texas name is worth a whole lot more than the trouble you're going to bring.

Leontuzzo:
That way, I can gradually come to terms with the terrifyingly dangerous situation I've been dealt.

Texas:
The Texases are already dead.

Leontuzzo:
Unfortunately, not everyone believes that.

Texas:
Maybe you're the one misreading how much influence a ruined famiglia can have.

Leontuzzo:
Maybe, but I'm not just talking about Famiglia Texas here. I'm also talking about you.

Leontuzzo:
You once returned to Siracusa from Columbia, only to leave again.

Leontuzzo:
The way I heard it, every famiglia involved in the 'liquidation' tried to kill you on your way out, but every last one of them failed.

Leontuzzo:
They were all made to pay a heavy price, and it was all sparked by a single woman—you.

Texas:
I just work for Penguin Logistics. I do deliveries.

Leontuzzo:
If you've already made your assessment of how much you're worth to Siracusa today, then let me assure you that—

Leontuzzo:
I know at least as much as you do.

Leontuzzo:
First things first, Signorina. You must have some idea of what's going on in Volsinii, right?

Texas:
...A new nomadic city.

Leontuzzo:
Precisely.

Leontuzzo:
And regardless of whether you acknowledge it or not, this plan is closely tied to your family name.

Leontuzzo:
Or should I say... it was brought on by the fall of Famiglia Texas.

The collapse of the Texases dealt a mortal blow to the authority of Columbia's famiglie, and they had no choice but to return to Siracusa's embrace.

They brought back Columbian technology as the price for regaining our trust. Finally, Siracusa had acquired the ability to build a new city of its own.

However, the most pressing issue quickly became who would have the rights to own it, and the power struggle within Grey Hall began the moment the plan to build the city was completed five years ago.

Today, that power struggle is finally drawing to a close.

As one of the oldest famiglie, we, the Bellones, have the opportunity to seize victory.

Volsinii's backup core is already being retrofitted to serve as the core of the new city, and new plates are steadily being built.

In a year's time, perhaps even less, it will be completed.

And your mission... is to help Famiglia Bellone turn this opportunity into a decisive victory.

Texas:
Sounds to me like what you needed was just a good enough hitman.

Leontuzzo:
But when the hitman's name is Texas, that might just change everything.

Leontuzzo:
Do you still remember the Rossati name?

Texas:
Rossati...? Yeah, that rings a bell.

Leontuzzo:
After the Texases were liquidated, the famiglie that had taken root in Columbia lived in constant fear of becoming the next target of Signora Sicilia's wrath.

Leontuzzo:
That's when Famiglia Rossati took the initiative to approach her themselves. They were the ones who brought back the technology to develop nomadic cities.

Leontuzzo:
For a brief moment, the Rossatis were poised to succeed the Texases, even managing to squeeze into one of the Twelve Seats of Grey Hall that no Texas had ever touched.

Texas:
This seems like one of those boring stories that goes nowhere.

Leontuzzo:
Boring, and brutal. Grey Hall has always been like that - open only to the winners.

Leontuzzo:
And the boss of Famiglia Rossati stationed in this city, Signor Wallach, will not be content lapping up the scraps we Bellones leave behind.

Texas:
And here I was thinking the dour mood around here was because of the rainy season.

Leontuzzo:
I'll be frank with you: Volsinii has not been peaceful these last few months. A few of our friends have found themselves in various kinds of 'accidents.'

Leontuzzo:
Along with them, the famiglie who still remain on the sidelines may end up changing their minds, and there's no guarantee that the famiglie that have already chosen their alliances won't betray them later.

Leontuzzo:
When Signora Sicilia established Grey Hall, she laid down an ironclad rule: 'Do not kill.'

Leontuzzo:
In other words, the famiglie have a lot of leeway to do whatever they want, short of killing one another.

Texas:
Could've fooled me.

Leontuzzo:
You are still standing in front of me, after all.

Texas:
Hmph.

Texas:
And so, you invited me back.

Texas:
You don't need me to do anything in particular; I just have to get up on the stage you've prepared and announce that I've returned.

Texas:
And that stage is tonight, correct?

Leontuzzo:
Signorina Texas, are you aware...

Leontuzzo:
...that the fall of the Texases has been adapted into one opera after another, performed across various major theaters?

Leontuzzo:
In those stories, you, Cellinia Texas, are always portrayed as an ignorant child, helpless in the face of your family's collapse.

Leontuzzo:
But right now, I can say for sure that you are anything but.

Leontuzzo:
I truly want to know... What exactly did you experience during that 'liquidation'?

Court Clerk:
You've returned, Your Honor?

Lavinia:
Yes. Is something going on?

Court Clerk:
Remember how Alessia said she recently met a pretty nice guy?

Lavinia:
The one who runs the textile shop?

Court Clerk:
So you knew after all!

Lavinia:
Yes, we've crossed paths a few times back when I was investigating a case. His famiglia...

Court Clerk:
Yes, Famiglia Gelli! Though they're not a particularly major famiglia, they still control all the textile businesses for a few streets down!

Court Clerk:
I heard they even have business dealings with some of the famiglie that make their way in and out of Grey Hall!

Lavinia:
Yes, we know.

Court Clerk:
Alessia has been talking us up for ages. She said the guy's going to bring some of his siblings along so we can all have a good time together!

Court Clerk:
It's been so busy around here lately, I haven't had a chance to cut loose and unwind!

Court Clerk:
Oh, Your Honor, umm...

Court Clerk:
You... aren't going, right?

Lavinia:
Right... I still have some work to do. Tell them I send my regards.

Court Clerk:
Okay! Will do!

Lavinia:
Oh right, did you get a chance to look through those files?

Court Clerk:
Which files?

Lavinia:
The mass disappearance on Via Como. Family of five. Remember?

Lavinia:
I've located a potential witness and am trying to convince him to testify.

Court Clerk:
But, Judge Angelo declared that case closed as of this afternoon.

Court Clerk:
He said... He said that family just moved to another city. Then, he added that we still have too many things to do, and shouldn't waste our time and energy on cases like this.

Lavinia:
Unless I am misremembering, <i>I</i> am the judge presiding over this case.

Court Clerk:
The court made the decision internally yesterday. You weren't present for the meeting.

Lavinia:
Is that so...?

Lavinia:
I get it.

Lavinia:
Right, this case is <i>certainly</i> not worth the time and energy. It's <i>only</i> five people after all.

Lavinia:
The husband drives a taxi around the city. The wife picks tomatoes on a farm. They have three children, the oldest only thirteen years of age, the youngest still breastfeeding.

Lavinia:
The neighbors were reluctant to say anything, and no matter who I asked, they all said that life must move on.

Lavinia:
There was no screaming in the night, no crying by the lake, and no traces of blood left on their squeaky-clean floorboards.

Lavinia:
Alright then. Life must move on, and they had it coming for crossing a famiglia. Or maybe their luck was so rotten they didn't even notice they were being targeted.

Lavinia:
After all, the famiglie always say they would <i>never</i> attack ordinary civilians.

Lavinia:
And as for us judges, there are always more important things to attend to, right?

Court Clerk:
......

Court Clerk:
Your Honor, I've always had the greatest respect for you.

Court Clerk:
To be honest, I have no idea what an ideal judge is supposed to look like.

Court Clerk:
Even though the Signora modeled our courts after Laterano's, and codified our laws after Columbia's...

Court Clerk:
None of us have ever seen a real one of Sankta's wandering judges, and Columbia's Code of Law is but an excerpt from a book.

Court Clerk:
What I would rather believe is that an ideal judge should be someone as determined to uphold justice as you are.

Court Clerk:
But not everyone has your talents, or your connections with Famiglia Bellone. You don't have to constantly fear for your life.

Lavinia:
No, I just—

Court Clerk:
You can casually grab a light meal with the son of the Don.

Court Clerk:
And earlier this morning, Judge Angelo received a letter sealed in a black envelope.

Lavinia:
...Which famiglia is behind this case?

Court Clerk:
Does it make a difference, as far as we're concerned?

Court Clerk:
Do you still remember last month how Judge Starocci was dragged by his 'friends' to 'chat' in a car for an entire afternoon? He hasn't been able to lift his right hand since.

Court Clerk:
Then there's Judge Borriello... That chubby, always-jovial old lady. How long has it been since she came to work?

Court Clerk:
You're right, in theory we're supposed to represent that woman's will. But what is that even supposed to be? At least, I can't figure it out.

Court Clerk:
Courage and persistence are great things to have, of course, but Judge Lavinia, please do not laugh at the wet clothes of us folks who stand beneath the eaves.

Court Clerk:
After all, you have nothing to lose.

Lavinia:
Is that so...?

Lavinia:
Perhaps the price I pay... is the right to truly be just.

Court Clerk:
......

Court Clerk:
Oh, the phones here don't ring very often. They usually prefer to come settle things privately.

Court Clerk:
Or should I say, they look to settle things with us privately.

Lavinia:
Hello.

Lavinia:
Got it. I'll be there right away.

Court Clerk:
Your Honor, you know you don't have to take everything so seriously.

Lavinia:
I know.

Court Clerk:
Should I bring back some macaroni for supper? We're going to a restaurant with pretty good reviews.

Lavinia:
...Appreciate it.
