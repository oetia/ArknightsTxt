Leontuzzo:
Where am I...

Demetri:
Oh, you're finally awake.

Leontuzzo:
This is... home?

Leontuzzo:
Demetri, why are you here?

Demetri:
Lavinia brought you back.

Demetri:
According to the doctor, you passed out due to a combination of your injuries and fatigue.

Leontuzzo:
......

Leontuzzo:
Tch.

Demetri:
Want an apple?

Leontuzzo:
Sure.

Demetri:
I knew you'd be hungry, so I already peeled it for you.

Leontuzzo:
Where's Lavinia?

Demetri:
She left after delivering you to the guards.

Demetri:
You should know by now that she's always been reluctant to set foot inside this mansion.

Demetri:
Her coming here for your sake is already a miracle in itself.

Leontuzzo:
......

Demetri:
Carracci's death is actually a bit of an issue.

Demetri:
And news of your injury is sure to get out.

Demetri:
In the eyes of the other famiglie, the Bellones have, in a heartbeat, gone from the clear frontrunner to a total mess, both inside and out.

Demetri:
Someone could show up at any moment to try to take a bite out of us.

Leontuzzo:
Did we keep any of the assailants alive long enough to get them to talk?

Demetri:
Unfortunately, no.

Demetri:
And we couldn't find any leads on their bodies either.

Leontuzzo:
I expected as much.

Demetri:
Any idea who could be behind this?

Leontuzzo:
The Saluzzos always kept their cards close to their chests, biding their time. For them, this is a prime opportunity.

Leontuzzo:
As for the Rossatis... They're probably victims too, since Wallach was with me when they attacked.

Demetri:
Still, Columbia's famiglie have never been a monolith.

Leontuzzo:
True, there's always the possibility of infighting among them.

Leontuzzo:
Besides, there are even more possibilities.

Leontuzzo:
Tch, they sure found themselves a nice opening.

Leontuzzo:
Mind pouring me some water?

Demetri:
You bastard, barking out even more orders than usual when you're lying in bed.

Leontuzzo:
Did... you really just pour me a cup of boiling water?

Demetri:
Is it my fault your order wasn't specific enough?

Leontuzzo:
Alright fine, I know this is how you express your dissatisfaction with me. What is it this time?

Demetri:
It's about the arrangement with Texas. I can't agree to it.

Leontuzzo:
Lavinia is a righteous person who would never frame an innocent. She has her own ideas.

Demetri:
That's not what I meant. She was supposed to be your sword.

Demetri:
When the boss handed her over to you, that came with the assurance that she would not endanger the famiglia.

Demetri:
You should've forged her into a razor-sharp blade.

Demetri:
But now, she's behind bars under Lavinia's watch.

Leontuzzo:
You seriously can't tell that she's looking out for our famiglia's interests?

Demetri:
I'll admit, holding onto Texas after today would only make things more precarious for you.

Demetri:
That her surname has appeared once more in Siracusa... draws far too much attention.

Demetri:
In that sense, you have a point. From Lavinia's perspective, it's safer to have Texas in hand.

Demetri:
But how is the rest of our famiglia supposed to see this?

Demetri:
They'll start to think that Leontuzzo, the next don of Famiglia Bellone, has gotten addicted to playing house on top of the tablecloth. That you've gone soft.

Demetri:
That not only do you not know how to swing a knife, you got it taken away from you.

Demetri:
The Bellones already lost the advantage. No matter who comes looking for trouble, we need to fight back tooth and nail.

Demetri:
Leon, the development of Volsinii's new district is more than the humdrum business of il Ministero dei Lavori Pubblici. It should be under Bellone control.

Leontuzzo:
......

Leontuzzo:
So that's what you really wanted to say to me.

Leontuzzo:
I also have my own plans, Demetri.

Demetri:
Let's hear them, then.

Leontuzzo:
......

Leontuzzo:
Alright, fratello. You <i>are</i> my trusted advisor.

Leontuzzo:
When I got attacked, I already had the feeling that things weren't adding up. And after hearing about Carracci's death, that became even more clear.

Leontuzzo:
You just asked me who I suspected could be behind this.

Leontuzzo:
I don't actually think it's a Saluzzo or a Rossati.

Demetri:
Why's that?

Leontuzzo:
The hitmen knew me all too well.

Leontuzzo:
They knew exactly how to hit our Famiglia with speed and precision, while targeting me at the same time.

Demetri:
So, what you're saying isâ€”

Leontuzzo:
I'm going to lock myself indoors for the next few days.

Leontuzzo:
I need to recover from my wounds.

Leontuzzo:
If people think we're fumbling in disarray, then let them think that.

Leontuzzo:
Until the true enemy shows their tail.

Demetri:
So you let Lavinia take Texas on purpose.

Leontuzzo:
That's right.

Leontuzzo:
As for how she wants to play her hand, that's for her to decide.

Leontuzzo:
In the meantime, there will no doubt be a slew of attacks on our famiglia.

Leontuzzo:
Pay close attention to whoever's scheming behind the scenes.

Demetri:
...Understood.

Leontuzzo:
So, was that a good enough answer for you?

Demetri:
Of course.

Demetri:
Since you have a clear plan in mind, naturally I'll help you put it into action.

Demetri:
You are, after all, the boss here.

Leontuzzo:
That's what I want to hear.

Leontuzzo:
Don't let me down, Demetri.

Leontuzzo:
Hello, Wallach? It's me.

Wallach:
Leon, I heard you were injured. How are you doing?

Leontuzzo:
I'm fine.

Leontuzzo:
We need to talk about what happened earlier today.

Leontuzzo:
I'd imagine... you probably have something to ask me too. About that name.

Wallach:
...'Texas.'

Volsinii Prison

Lavinia:
So, you were held up at the time.

Lavinia:
Who was holding you up?

Texas:
An old acquaintance.

Lavinia:
Awfully convenient for them to show up just then, don't you think?

Texas:
......

Lavinia:
You're pretty used to being in this kind of situation, aren't you?

Texas:
Back in Lungmen, I'd sometimes let myself get interrogated like this.

Lavinia:
Lungmen, huh...

Texas:
Anyway, I'd have no reason to do anything like that.

Lavinia:
That's what they all say.

Lavinia:
To be honest, though, I don't think you could've been the perpetrator, Cellinia. I can't imagine it would've done you any good.

Lavinia:
Also, Leon contacted me beforehand and gave me a few reasons why I should trust you.

Lavinia:
So that's why you showed up at a venue where so many important figures were present. It was originally prepared as a stage for you by Famiglia Bellone.

Lavinia:
However, given the current circumstances, our best option is for me to keep you here.

Texas:
You're protecting Leontuzzo.

Lavinia:
I'm protecting you as well, Texas.

Lavinia:
Also... this may divert the attention of the other famiglie. They will be speculating what Bellone's next move will be after getting hit like this.

Lavinia:
And those suspicions... might loosen some of the fetters around my ankles.

Texas:
Are you really a judge?

Lavinia:
Why would you ask that?

Texas:
You seem to know a lot about how the famiglie operate.

Lavinia:
I am, in fact, a judge.

Lavinia:
But to be good at this job in Siracusa, you need to know how the mafiosi keep themselves alive, even better than they do.

Lavinia:
Even if I'd rather not know.

Texas:
You misunderstood me. It's not at all surprising that a law enforcement official would know a thing or two about the people you're enforcing it on.

Texas:
But what I meant was that judges like you didn't exist back in the old Siracusa.

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
Don't get the wrong idea, Cellinia Texas.

Lavinia:
I didn't bring you here because of the so-called checks and balances among the famiglie. Outsiders may interpret my stance as such, but I couldn't care less.

Lavinia:
You just arrived in this city, and you still don't understand how important Ministro Carracci really was.

Lavinia:
He was an outstanding person. He could've made the new city under construction something far better.

Lavinia:
It wasn't just another project to expand his business, either. He wanted to make it possible for the citizens to enjoy a new way of life.

Lavinia:
But he's dead now.

Lavinia:
And I will find his murderer and bring them to justice.

Lavinia:
They think they can dispose of the people who refuse to bend the knee one after another, as if they were puppets.

Lavinia:
But I will make them realize that they are not tossing away a broken doll. They are murdering living, flesh-and-blood people.

Alberto:
So, Carracci's death had nothing to do with you.

Lappland:
Right.

Alberto:
And you didn't find out who the murderer was.

Lappland:
Pretty much.

Alberto:
And the task I gave you, to investigate exactly why Bellone decided to bring back Texas? No leads there either?

Lappland:
You never miss a beat, my dear father.

Alberto:
And despite having accomplished nothing at all, you didn't even bother showing up when I called to convene a meeting.

Lappland:
The traffic is pretty bad this time of year.

Alberto:
Lappland, when I kicked you out of the house seven years ago, you lost your right to call yourself a Saluzzo. Do you understand what that means?

Lappland:
Of course I do. It means you won't show any mercy when you decide to dispose of a disobedient tool like me.

Alberto:
You've always been so self-aware, yet never have the slightest inclination to act accordingly.

Lappland:
Do you really need me to personally deliver a little warning to the poor little Judgie?

Alberto:
Why would I feel a need to warn her?

Lappland:
Now that the princeling pup is hiding behind closed doors, everybody's gonna think the sharp-tongued little Judgie is a Bellone puppet.

Lappland:
And with your personality, you aren't inclined to believe that the Bellones are as weak as they present.

Lappland:
So wouldn't it be common sense to use the judge's well-being to test the waters?

Alberto:
Seeing how you understand what to do, I want to see results.

Lappland:
Why naturally, I'd never disobey your orders. Assuming our interests align, that is.

Lappland:
My dearest father.

Sora:
Salvadore! What are we to do now?!

Sora:
Am I to thank you for freeing me from the clutches of my own blood relative? Am I to thank you for spilling blood so that the Infected workers may have full stomachs?

Sora:
The man you killed was my father!

Sora:
No, I do not need a list of his crimes. I should think I know them better than you. The scars on our bodies are proof of his cruelty. The deaths of those laborers were proof of his exploitation.

Sora:
But still, despite it all!

Sora:
Salvadore, I truly thank you from the bottom of my heart, for saving me and so many others.

Sora:
But the stench of blood lingering about you grows stronger and stronger...

Sora:
Let us be away from this place, Salvadore, just the two of us... Take me somewhere we will at last be able to find peace, alright?

Sora:
It might already be too late.

Sora:
Salvadore, it might already have been too late the day you first set foot in Columbia, from when you first sharpened your blade...

Sora:
You say this was all destined? That it couldn't have been avoided?

Sora:
I can't help but think... If I were in Vivienne's place, would I be able to forgive Salvadore?

Sora:
Even if what he did could be forgiven, the grudge would follow the both of them for the rest of their lives.

???:
Exactly right, signorina.

Sora:
Huh?

???:
That the two of them were able to get together in the end is, of course, artistic license.

???:
In fact, the real Salvadore did not elope with Vivienne.

???:
Also, despite the fact that Vivienne's father was indeed as callous as he was wealthy, he took good care of his family - particularly Vivienne, whom he doted on like a diamond in the palm of his hand.

Sora:
Oh...

???:
Very rarely is someone pure evil, don't you think?

???:
Therefore, even if the perpetrator was someone you loved dearly, even if you were aware of your father's despicable acts, something like what he did is not so easily forgiven.

???:
Signorina Vivienne ultimately chose to leave him and move to a new city, where she met someone who truly loved her and thus began a new life.

???:
But, until her last breath, she never forgot the man named Salvadore.

???:
So in a sense, this story can be seen as vicariously helping her dream come true.

Sora:
Did you... know Ms Vivienne well?

???:
Hmm... I suppose you could say that.

Caterina:
My name is Caterina. You're quite the lovely young actress.

Caterina:
Are you new here? I swing by frequently, but I've never seen your face before.

Sora:
I am. My name is Sora, and I came from Lungmen.

Caterina:
Lungmen? How fascinating.

Caterina:
I've heard of many actors who went to Lungmen to develop their careers, but rarely the other way around.

Sora:
Sometimes, there's value in bucking the trend.

Caterina:
Too true.

Sora:
So Miss Caterina, do you know what happened to the actual Ms Vivienne?

Caterina:
Vivienne, huh... She never forgot Salvadore.

Caterina:
Maybe that's why her son chose a similar pathâ€” he became a wise guy, and gradually rose to become the don of a certain famiglia.

Caterina:
A famiglia that would eventually go on to clash against Salvadore himself.

Caterina:
Fortunately, Vivienne came forward and prevented the two rivals from becoming mortal enemies, and eventually they even became allies.

Sora:
Wait, are you talking about the Rossati Family from the script?

Caterina:
That's right. Have you already read through the entire thing?

Sora:
Yes... I also wanted to learn as much as I could about the Texas Family's history, for some personal reasons.

Caterina:
So what did you think of the story?

Sora:
I... There are a few bits I can't make sense of.

Caterina:
Oh? For example?

Sora:
For example, Salvadore's granddaughter...

Exusiai:
Sora, the stylist wants you to take a look at the design of your costume!

Sora:
Okay, I'll be right there!

Sora:
Sorry, but I have to go.

Caterina:
I don't mind. We'll have another chance to talk.

Exusiai:
Soraâ€”

Caterina:
Take your time. We can always chat at our leisure some other day.

Sora:
Okay, that's great!

Caterina:
Salvadore's granddaughter.

Caterina:
Heh.

Wallach:
You're wasting time at the theater again, boss.

Caterina:
How many times do I have to tell you, Wallach? It's not a waste of time.

Wallach:
You pushed most of your work onto me just so you could go write a shitty play? Is that what the boss of a famiglia should be doing? And you even gave yourself a pseudonym?

Caterina:
Do you have a problem with that?

Wallach:
Of course not. You are none other than Giovanna Rossati, our beloved Donna.

Giovanna:
I know you're dissatisfied with me.

Giovanna:
Butâ€”

Giovanna:
Is there really anything in this city worth worrying over?

Wallach:
......

Wallach:
Before, no. But now, yes.

Wallach:
Carracci is dead.

Giovanna:
Oh?

Giovanna:
But Carracci was originally just a ordinary man, elevated by the famiglie to keep each other in check.

Giovanna:
All his death proves is that Bellone was not capable enough, nothing more.

Wallach:
And someone greatly resembling Cellinia appeared at Leontuzzo's side.

Giovanna:
......

Giovanna:
Say that again?

Wallach:
Texas. Cellinia Texas.

Giovanna:
Wallach, I don't recall you being the sort of man who liked to crack jokes.

Giovanna:
And you should also know that I hate people who joke about Texas more than anything else.

Wallach:
So you can tell I'm not joking.

Wallach:
I have no idea how Bellone managed to find her, but she had those unmistakable eyes and hair.

Wallach:
Exactly like the one in your photo.

Giovanna:
So she didn't die...

Wallach:
And she's with Leontuzzo now.

Giovanna:
She would never have survived the liquidation if not for a certain famiglia protecting her.

Giovanna:
...The logical conclusion is that Bellone saved her back then.

Giovanna:
Looks like we're going to need to have a little chat.

Wallach:
Giovanna, this clearly is a trapâ€”

Giovanna:
Wallach.

Wallach:
...My apologies, boss.

Giovanna:
It's not so much a 'trap' as an entire conspiracy.

Giovanna:
Think bigger.

Giovanna:
If they really were the ones who saved her back then, what good does it do me to drop by and express my gratitude?

Giovanna:
Make preparations. 'Business discussions' are over. I'm paying Volsinii a visit.

Wallach:
Understood. I'll make the arrangements.

Giovanna:
Alas, it seems that the new script will have to go on the backburner for a while.

Wallach:
......

Wallach:
Boss, I'm sure you're aware that Carracci's death presents an excellent opportunity for us.

Wallach:
But you still seem hung up on the Texas name.

Wallach:
If this keeps up, the Rossatis won't have a future.
