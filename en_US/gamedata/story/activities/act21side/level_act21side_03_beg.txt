Exusiai:
Woooah, this dress looks absolutely stunning!

Croissant:
You'n say that again. Sora's gonna look mighty fine in it.

Exusiai:
If someone told me about this earlier, I would've signed up myself!

Croissant:
No way, no how. Ya don't know the first thing about actin'.

Exusiai:
I can just act like I always do.

Croissant:
And there ain't no roles for a Sankta in Siracusa neither!

Exusiai:
Says who? I heard that there was a Sankta with Signora Sicilia—

Exusiai:
Huh?

Frivolous Mafioso:
Signorina Sally, our boss is inviting you over for dinner.

Actress:
Um... But...

Stony-Faced Bodyguard:
She's on her way to rehearsal right now. Vaffanculo.

Frivolous Mafioso:
And our boss wants to have a word with Signorina Sally here. Being a little late won't make a difference, will it?

Actress:
I, I'll go get the director...

Frivolous Mafioso:
The director? I might've carried water for him in the past, but these days...

Actress:
Um, please don't...

Angry Mafioso:
The hell are you playin' nice with them for?

Angry Mafioso:
You should feel honored that our boss wants to see you. If you don't wanna get messed up, behave yourself and come with us.

Frivolous Mafioso:
Wait, the boss didn't say we could—

Angry Mafioso:
You still don't understand what the boss was gettin' at? We were all scared of the Bellones before.

Angry Mafioso:
But now that they are out of the picture, and the bigwigs are about to shuffle the deck again, we'll never get a better chance!

Frivolous Mafioso:
Huh, you're right. Let's go, brothers, time to clean the streets of these eyesores!

Stony-Faced Bodyguard:
Tch... Protect Signorina Sally!

Croissant:
The heck's happenin', Exu— Huh? Where'd she go?

Sora:
She already rushed out. Let's back her up!

Stony-Faced Bodyguard:
Urgh...

Frivolous Mafioso:
Heh, and you call yourself a bodyguard?

Actress:
Ahh... *sobs*...

Frivolous Mafioso:
Right this way, signorina.

Actress:
I, I know...

Actress:
Huh? You people are—

Frivolous Mafioso:
Who the hell are you?!

Exusiai:
Catch me if you can.

Frivolous Mafioso:
Tch, get her!

Angry Mafioso:
Don't mess with us!

Croissant:
Let's split!

Exusiai:
Your name's Sally, right? You okay?

Actress:
You...

Actress:
Do you know what you've done?!

Actress:
You didn't save me at all, you're just making things worse! They're not going to let this go!

Exusiai:
So how'd you plan to get out of that mess?

Actress:
...By gritting my teeth.

Exusiai:
Huh? But they were gonna hurt you.

Actress:
I... can deal with injuries.

Actress:
Did you really think they were going to kidnap me? They're just trying to cause trouble.

Exusiai:
Shouldn't you at least call for help when stuff like this happens?

Actress:
What's the point? Nobody's going to intervene in a struggle between famiglie.

Exusiai:
What about that Judge Lavinia lady? She seemed like a pretty decent person to me.

Actress:
She's... indeed a very good judge, but there's nothing she can do in these situations.

Actress:
Besides, even if I never made it out of this park, how many people would know that I disappeared because of the conflict between those mafiosi?

Sora:
So... you're just going to put up with it?

Actress:
How else are we supposed to live our lives? This is how it's always been.

Actress:
Find a place to hide, wait until the dust settles, and then follow the victorious side out. That's all I can do.

Sora:
But... why does it have to be like that?

Actress:
......

Actress:
Ugh, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to blame you, but to be honest, this is the first time in my life I've ever known what it feels like to be protected.

Actress:
That famiglia isn't even particularly influential. The director should be able to help me smooth things over.

Actress:
But just as a friendly word of advice, if you plan to stay alive in Siracusa, please try to avoid doing that kind of stuff in the future.

Actress:
Especially considering what's about to happen.

Exusiai:
What's about to happen?

Actress:
Have you not seen the news at all? Carracci, Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici, is dead.

Croissant:
Yeah, saw that. Assassinated, looks like?

Sora:
I feel so bad for him.

Actress:
Since you all seem nice enough, I'll tell you a little more about him.

Actress:
I have to deal with mafiosi pretty regularly, so I've heard a thing or two from them.

Actress:
The person who murdered him hasn't been found yet, and the young master of Famiglia Bellone was also attacked at the same time.

Sora:
Huh? Bellone?!

Actress:
That's right. The Bellones were poised to stand head and shoulders above the other famiglie, but it seems like someone's been plotting against them for a while now.

Actress:
Many famiglie that had previously given up are now starting to move again, little by little.

Sora:
Did you hear any of them mention the name Texas?

Actress:
Texas? There's not a single person in Siracusa who doesn't know that name.

Actress:
But usually in the context of 'the last Texas' or something along those lines...

Sora:
Really?!

Actress:
You're a strange one, you know that? It's obviously all made-up. How could there possibly be a Texas still alive out there?

Sora:
But... Alright, you have a point.

Actress:
In any case, you should already know that our troupe has some connections to Famiglia Bellone, through the director.

Actress:
Just as those people were saying, in the past everyone wanted to get on his good side. But now...

Actress:
You all saw what happened.

Exusiai:
Do all of Siracusa's famiglie go around doing whatever the hell they want like that?

Actress:
...Remember what I'm about to tell you.

Actress:
If you want to survive in Siracusa, you either need to join a famiglia, or stay as far away from them as possible.

Actress:
Then... you need to delude yourself into believing that as long as you stay away from them, you won't get sucked into any trouble.

Actress:
Alright, I should head back to the theater now.

Sora:
Right.

Actress:
Aaaaaaaahhhh—!

Exusiai:
What now?!

Actress:
S-Someone's been tied up over here!

Gambino:
Assuming nothin' outta the ordinary happened, someone ought to have found the poor fella by now.

Gambino:
I don't get it, man. Why go through all that trouble keeping him alive, just to let him go? What's so special about that guy anyway?

Capone:
What it proves is, that shady bartender wanted him to be found.

Capone:
As for why... it's usually a trap.

Gambino:
Tch, what a sinister fella.

Capone:
You say that now, but if he ends up winning, you're gonna be calling him a genius.

Gambino:
Dipshit.

Capone:
Hah.

Gambino:
What's so funny?

Capone:
I just remembered how we used to argue like this back when we were kids.

Capone:
Never would've imagined that after all these years, after all of life's twists and turns, the two of us'd still be out here, fightin' for our lives.

Capone:
That's fate for you. Never know where it's gonna take you.

Gambino:
Heh. Ain't that the truth.

Gambino:
Who could've known something like that would happen in Lungmen?

Gambino:
And that after all that, we'd still come back to Siracusa.

Capone:
Gambino... If, and I mean if, Lappland has really decided to leave us alone, and let us fend for ourselves...

Capone:
Would you still stay in Siracusa?

Gambino:
What, do you miss your Lungmen that bad?

Capone:
Hmph. Forget it, not like you'd ever understand anyway.

Capone:
Let's talk about something more practical. You really plan on switching employers?

Capone:
Looking at the news, the guy we tried to off today was Don Bellone's son. Seems like someone real important died at the same time.

Capone:
Which sounds to me an awful lot like some unknown famiglia has been using us as their weapons.

Gambino:
Might as well go make that relationship formal, then.

Gambino:
Better than taking on odd jobs and begging for scraps.

???:
That's right. As soon as you're back in Siracusa, you participate in an attempted assassination of one of the Dodici dons. You two sure have grown.

Capone:
Guess the good ol' days are over...

Gambino:
Lappland...

Lappland:
Oh? Today's breakfast is looking pretty good.

Gambino:
Pay for your own.

Lappland:
Aw, is that any way to treat your boss?

Capone:
So, what've you been up to all this time?

Lappland:
I went to say hi to the folks, and got to enjoy some sorely-missed family time. Simple as that.

Lappland:
Haah, what a relief that despicable old mug back home is just as punchable as it's always been.

Capone:
You with a famiglia?

Lappland:
Oh, did I never mention it? My last name is Saluzzo.

Gambino:
Saluzzo?

Gambino:
You're a Saluzzo?

Capone:
......

Lappland:
Capone, do you know what the thing I hate the third most is?

Capone feels a chill course through his body, but the sensation is so fleeting that he has to wonder if it was his imagination.

Lappland:
When people start wailing and moaning once they hear the name of my famiglia.

Lappland:
Ah, come to think of it, the way you do things really does remind me of that one famiglia.

Capone:
What about the other two things? If I'm gonna die, might as well die knowing.

Lappland:
Haha. Seems like you've picked up on how to get along with me.

Lappland:
Actually, I just came up with that line on the spot.

Capone:
Tch.

Lappland:
Alright, talk to me. So why'd the two of you decide to do a hit on Famiglia Bellone?

Rubio:
Come in.

Lavinia:
Sorry for bothering you, Signor Segretario.

Rubio:
No, no, Your Honor, the pleasure is mine.

Lavinia:
Your office is... quite impressive.

Rubio:
Haha, I frequently have distinguished guests here, and this is the sort of decor they prefer, so I figured I'd go along with it.

Rubio:
So, did you need me for something?

Lavinia:
I wanted to talk to you about Carracci's death.

Rubio:
Hmm? I believe I already made a statement about that.

Lavinia:
I know.

Lavinia:
But I wanted to have a chat with you, for more personal reasons.

Rubio:
Oh right... I heard you swore you'd find Carracci's murderer and bring them to justice.

Rubio:
Good, good. Young folks ought to have that kind of drive.

Rubio:
So have you made any progress?

Lavinia:
Unfortunately, not yet.

Rubio:
Sorry to hear that.

Lavinia:
I heard you'd always been on good terms with him personally, so...

Rubio:
That's true. Carracci was greatly concerned with the citizenry's well being, things such as food, water, and sanitation.

Rubio:
But I don't think there's anything I can do to assist you.

Rubio:
I never actually mingled my way into his innermost circle.

Rubio:
So while I'd love to help, there's nothing I can do.

Lavinia:
Anything you can give me is fine. A place you think is suspicious, or anyone in the government I should keep an eye on.

Rubio:
You're asking too much. You understand what I'm saying, don't you?

Rubio:
Your Honor... several other Ministri dei Lavori Pubblici died before Carracci. Do you remember them?

Rubio:
Seven? Or maybe eight?

Rubio:
The people in those positions were just puppets. Each famiglia was trying to push their own people up there.

Rubio:
But in the end, they were all taken out by other famiglie.

Rubio:
When it came to a position as important as il Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici, though, I'll be blunt here, it was clear as day why the famiglie filled the position with a man as spotless as Carracci instead of installing one of their cronies.

Rubio:
For one simple reason: if the killing continued, the construction of the city would grind to a halt.

Rubio:
'If our people can't get in, then we'll at least make sure yours can't either.' That is why Carracci occupied that seat.

Rubio:
Make no mistake, he had close ties with the Bellones. The Don's son even sat beside him as his secretary. But, in one way or another, he was just as close with every other famiglia.

Rubio:
There's an ancient Yan saying to the effect of 'he who walks oft along the river, inevitably finds his shoes wet,' yes? I have always trusted in Carracci's integrity, but so what? Others did not see it that way.

Rubio:
The way Siracusans think, you either choose to be one famiglia's pet, or you choose to be another's.

Rubio:
In other words, Carracci's death was inevitable. He wasn't part of any of famiglia's vision for the future. Do you think he was oblivious to that fact?

Rubio:
In the end, it doesn't matter whether he died today, a month ago, or a month from now.

Lavinia:
You know how much hard work he put in.

Rubio:
And what did he get for it in the end?

Rubio:
Actually, let's assume he was as selfless a person as you say. What did the people he worked so hard for, those whom he so eloquently claimed as 'his dear citizens,' give him in the end?

Lavinia:
......

Rubio:
Your Honor, I've also heard a great many rumors about you.

Rubio:
You undeniably have a fair number of accomplishments under your belt.

Rubio:
But among them, how many were due solely to your own hard work, and how many were influenced by the people behind your back? You already know the answer, don't you?

Lavinia:
You—

Rubio:
If I may be frank, Your Honor, are you really not here to test me on behalf of Bellone?

Lavinia:
That is not my intention, I swear.

Rubio:
...I'd prefer it were.

Rubio:
Then please heed this word of caution, Your Honor.

Rubio:
Let those who've died stay dead.

Rubio:
We already have too much to worry about without overly concerning ourselves with the deceased.

Lavinia:
And... this is the attitude of someone who was on good terms with him?

Rubio:
If you want to have a slightly longer lease on life in Volsinii's government, I'd suggest you learn this lesson well.

Rubio:
Oh, hello sweetheart. Ah, I'm still at work right now. Are you ready to go?

Rubio:
Mm, alright. I'll get ready to head over then.

Rubio:
Okay, okay.

Rubio:
That was my daughter. Now, a newly-opened restaurant has invited me to inspect their ingredients tonight.

Rubio:
We'll have to set aside our discussion for later.

Lavinia:
......

Rubio:
Oh right, please let Master Leontuzzo know that he is welcome to talk to me if he's interested in the gourmet experience.

Lavinia:
...I'll remember to pass it on.

Rubio:
Now then, please see yourself out.

Lavinia:
...*sigh*.

Lavinia:
What did you say? You found someone unconscious and tied up? The leader of the bunch that attacked the restaurant?

Lavinia:
Understood. I'll be there right away.

Gambino:
I'm telling you, the two of us just happened to be involved in that hit. We don't know nothing.

Capone:
As for the guy who handed out the orders, we don't know which famiglia he belongs to, but he sure was generous with the cash.

Lappland:
They were clearly looking for hitmen with murky backgrounds like you two, so when you die, there'd be no trail back to who hired you.

Lappland:
You might think you ran into them by chance, but it wouldn't surprise me if they had their eyes on you a long time ago.

Capone:
I'm not saying they didn't.

Lappland:
So, want to take a crack at who your employer is?

Capone:
Probably... the Rossatis or the Saluzzos. Of the Dodici who've been fighting over this city all this time, and with the Bellones out of the picture, they're the only two famiglie with enough power left.

Lappland:
Right, I'm sure most people would think the same.

Lappland:
But now you know the Saluzzos were never planning anything like that.

Gambino:
That just leaves... the Rossatis?

Lappland:
One more.

Gambino:
What do you mean?

Lappland:
Remember those poor suckers you took out early on? They were originally targeting people from il Ministero dei Lavori Pubblici.

Lappland:
Don Bellone's son's been working there, so another way of putting this is that the folks you dealt with were trying to get in Bellone's way.

Capone:
So... what you're saying is, we helped the Bellones put down a threat, but then turned right around and hit 'em even harder.

Gambino:
...So what? We see famiglie doing that kinda power jockeying stuff every day.

Capone:
That... He's got a point. The first hit we made might've just been on some unlucky, short-sighted bastards.

Lappland:
But don't forget, you were specifically sent to 'shut them up.'

Capone:
Wait, are you serious?!

Gambino:
Are you suggesting... there's a double agent inside the Bellones?

Lappland:
Just another possibility.

Lappland:
Hahaha, but hey, that's what makes things interesting.

Lappland:
Let's assume that's true and do a little thought experiment here.

Lappland:
Carracci, il Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici, is dead. And before that, several more people in the ministero were killed.

Lappland:
Naturally, most people are going to see those things as connected, especially that poor judge.

Lappland:
But. The perpetrator who carried out the hit has already been silenced, and she can't find their leader either. She's at a complete loss, so what does she do next?

Lappland:
If only some kind of clue would appear.

Lappland:
And what do you know, isn't that assassin you dumped out there the best possible lead?

Capone:
So that's why they waited until now to throw that guy out...

Capone:
It does make sense, when you put it that way.

Capone:
Then, they set up a little ambush, and make sure the judge has an 'accident'...

Lappland:
Kaboom.

Lappland stretches out her hands and falls back onto the sofa, as if knocked back by the blast.

Lappland:
Everyone's gonna get pulled in.

Lappland:
Ahh, what a great idea.

Lappland:
It's so great that even if this is all bullshit, I'd <i>want</i> to make it reality.

Gambino:
So... lemme get this straight, you two are sayin' that the Bellones are puttin' on a whole goddamn opera?

Capone:
It's definitely possible.

Capone:
After all, nobody understands the Bellones better than themselves.

Gambino:
Hmph. I don't buy it.

Gambino:
These are the famiglia's plans for the future we're talking about. There ain't a single wise guy in all of Siracusa who'd attack his own famiglia at a time like this.

Capone:
Gambino, you should've realized by now that kinda blind confidence is what brought down the Sicilians.

Gambino:
You—

Capone:
But I gotta say, I think I agree with you this time.

Lappland:
Aha! Then maybe they're putting on this show to feign weakness, so everyone thinks they're vulnerable and—

Capone:
But they were already on the cusp of victory.

Capone:
Do you seriously think that the Bellones just decided to give up on a city that was right at their fingertips, just to turn this whole place upside-down?

Gambino:
Are they crazy or something?

Lappland:
Who knows? There are more lunatics walking this land than you might think.

Lappland:
Haha, but I guess our merry mealtime needs to wrap up.

Lappland:
I hope you have a jolly ol' time out there.

Capone:
You stopped by just to say hello?

Lappland:
What, are you that eager to be my henchmen?

Capone:
I wouldn't say it's high on my priorities.

Capone:
But at least tell us which side you're on.

Capone:
Last thing I want is to end up fighting against you without realizing, and dying without knowing what hit me.

Lappland:
Me? Naturally, I'll always be Texas's most loyal supporter.

Demetri:
Is everyone in position for the ambush?

Bodyguard:
...Yes.

Demetri:
You seem like you want to say something.

Bodyguard:
I was just thinking... I feel bad for Signorina Lavinia.

Bodyguard:
Whatever the case may be, she's a friend to the famiglia.

Demetri:
If only the one she befriended wasn't Leon, the next don of Famiglia Bellone—

Demetri:
Look, I don't want to be the villain either.

Demetri:
So she wants to play her little game of justice. Sure, that we can allow, to an extent.

Demetri:
But she thinks she has the backing of one of the bosses. What she's done over the years has had a larger and larger impact on Leon... No, on our entire famiglia.

Demetri:
The Bellones don't need softness like that.

Demetri:
She must be made crystal-clear of this fact, and so must Leon.

Demetri:
Otherwise...

Demetri:
We'll never be able to seize ultimate victory from the chaos that's about to ensue.

Bodyguard:
But, the young master, he—

Demetri:
I know many of you are still conflicted about this. I will assume full responsibility for whatever happens. When Leon eventually comes asking who to blame, I won't get any of you involved.

Bodyguard:
...*sigh*.

Texas:
...Who's there?

Lappland:
I've brought you some chocolate. Want some?

Texas:
I see prison security in Siracusa is as shoddy as ever.

Lappland:
You know, they call this one impregnable, at least compared to other cities.

Texas:
......

Texas lets out a tiny sigh, and takes a bite out of the chocolate in Lappland's hand.

It's her least favorite flavor.

Lappland:
Hah. And here I thought you'd be chasing me out instead.

Texas:
That takes a lot more effort than just ignoring you.

Texas:
So long as you don't get in my way, do whatever you want.

Lappland:
Aw, I'm almost moved to tears here, Texas. Even you're gradually figuring out how to get along with me.

Lappland:
I never get in other peoples' way. I'd much rather clear the fog for them, so they can better see where they're going.

Texas:
How much do the Saluzzos know?

Lappland:
No more than you do.

Lappland:
The Bellones were pretty much a shoo-in to win, but to keep the Rossatis down, they even brought you back from Lungmen, as a precautionary measure of sorts.

Lappland:
But right at the critical moment, yesterday's assassination took place.

Lappland:
It's so blatant that people can't help but think it had to be intentional. Is the perpetrator even trying to stay hidden?

Texas:
......

Lappland:
So what about you? Planning to sit in this cell reminiscing about every little thing that happened in Lungmen until that judge lets you go?

Lappland:
Weren't you in a hurry to get back there?

Texas:
If you consider the wait as just another leg of the journey home, then I can be pretty patient.

Lappland:
But what if that judge is in danger?

Texas:
......

Lavinia:
Where is he? Has he woken up yet?

Court Clerk:
Good to see you here, Your Honor! We've already taken full control of the scene.

Court Clerk:
The suspect is still unconscious, but he was tied up and stuffed into a trash can over by the corner. We've already notified the hospital.

Lavinia:
Who found him?

Court Clerk:
A group of actors from Compagnia dell'alba. They already left because they had a rehearsal to get to.

Lavinia:
Compagnia dell'alba... Bernardo's people?

Lavinia:
He really is cursed with bad luck.

Court Clerk:
Your Honor, the people murdered in the witness elimination case you reported last time were this person's accomplices, right?

Lavinia:
Yes, but we couldn't find anything on them to identify them with.

Court Clerk:
Why would their leader show up here in such a sorry state then...?

Court Clerk:
Want me to try waking him up?

Lavinia:
Please do.

Calm Hitman:
*cough* *cough*... *cough* *cough*!

Lavinia:
Stop struggling. We already have you restrained.

Calm Hitman:
...Lavinia.

Lavinia:
Do you understand the situation you're in? Who tied you up and dumped you here?

Calm Hitman:
Do you really need to ask, judge?

Lavinia:
Answer my question, murderer.

Calm Hitman:
Heh. Maybe I can invoke Article 14 of the penal code to remain silent under informal investigations.

Lavinia:
...You're pretty familiar with the law.

Calm Hitman:
What, are you gonna use Article 132, the right of special dispensation, on me? Judge?

Lavinia:
Just who are you?

Calm Hitman:
Your average everyday murderer.

Lavinia:
I, I remember now... I've seen you before.

Calm Hitman:
Last night at the restaurant, no? You rescued that hapless clerk from il Ministero dei Lavori Pubblici.

Lavinia:
It was three years ago, at a legal forum. Judge Bortolotti from the city of Sorrento gave a particularly outstanding speech.

Calm Hitman:
......

Lavinia:
Signor, I was deeply impressed by your report.

Calm Hitman:
Well, I just kill people for a living now. It's an easy life. What you're talking about, I can barely even remember anymore.

Lavinia:
This isn't who you are.

Calm Hitman:
Stop acting so self-righteous, Lavinia. You really think you understand me? Just from a fantasy-filled report at a window-dressing legal forum?

Lavinia:
You can't hide true passion. That's what you said back then.

Calm Hitman:
Right, along with all the other naive, idealistic nonsense I rattled off. All young people are like that, thinking they can change the world all on their own.

Calm Hitman:
I just happened to wake up sooner than you, Lavinia.

Lavinia:
You said, 'we should all strive to find the common line that can protect anyone.'

Calm Hitman:
Yes, here's an example: join a famiglia, listen to the boss, and kill anyone who gets in your way.

Lavinia:
Judge Bortolotti, I can help you.

Calm Hitman:
Hah! Help me?!

Calm Hitman:
Oh, that's right. You have the great and powerful Bellones backing you.

Calm Hitman:
Your honor and dignity will stay untarnished. You won't get chained down or beaten up for a moment of naivete. You won't come home to the sight of your house going up in smoke along with your family.

Calm Hitman:
You don't know a damn thing, Judge Lavinia.

Calm Hitman:
You have no idea how weighty the code you hold in your hand is, and how easily it can destroy your life.

Calm Hitman:
And luckily for you, you'll never have a chance to find out.

Court Clerk:
Watch out, Lavinia!

Lavinia:
What...?

Texas:
We need to get out of here, now.

Lavinia:
Texas?

Texas:
They've sent a ton of people. Come with me.
