Sora:
Texas.

Sora:
Salvadore Texas. What am I to think of you? Should I trust you?

Sora:
You are a Siracusan. They all say that violence and ambition runs in your veins. That you and your famiglia will devour this place... No, all of Columbia.

Sora:
Is the man I see before my eyes truly you? So refined, so upstanding?

Sora:
But I've also seen the way you throw a punch, the blood dripping between your fingers until your opponent is not able to utter even a single curse.

Sora:
Which is the real you, Salvadore?

Sora:
Might there come a day when you realize that your two sides are as oil and water? Might there come a day when the trail of blood in your wake catches up to you?

Sora:
And when that day comes, what would you choose?

Sora:
When that day comes... would you remain by my side?

Bernardo:
A brilliant performance, signorina.

Bernardo:
Without a doubt, you've surpassed my expectations yet again.

Sora:
Actually, it's all thanks to someone in the troupe called Mr. Ben. I would never have been able to adjust so quickly without his advice.

Bernardo:
Ben?

Bernardo:
I'm not sure we have anyone by that name at Teatro di Milano.

Sora:
Huh?

Sora:
He was really knowledgeable about theater and gave me some extremely helpful pointers, so I figured he was an important person here.

Bernardo:
Sorry, no one comes to mind. That said, there are plenty of enthusiasts around town who are very well-versed in plays. Perhaps he was one of them.

Bernardo:
More importantly, I saw something on your resume that had me a bit curious. Would you mind clarifying something for me?

Sora:
Sure, ask away.

Bernardo:
You've been pursuing a pop idol career in Lungmen.

Bernardo:
We've been collaborating with that city more and more recently, but our acting industries have often been at odds with each other, due to their different backgrounds.

Bernardo:
But even with that caveat in mind, the clips from your audition sent over by Monster Siren Records convinced me that you have some musical talent.

Bernardo:
What this tells me, though, is that you have your sights set on a lot more than just Lungmen.

Bernardo:
What drives you to work so hard?

Sora:
Well... a lot of different reasons, I'd say.

Sora:
But at the start, I didn't have anything complicated in mind. There was just someone I hoped to catch up to.

Bernardo:
Oh?

Sora:
Hehe, it's just like in the script.

Sora:
Every time she gazed through the window, or out the door, or across the empty streets, her eyes...

Sora:
Her eyes made me feel like, one day, she would leave both us and Lungmen behind.

Sora:
'And when that day comes, what would you choose?'

Texas:
......

Lappland:
What's the hurry? Don't you think it's a miracle for the two of us to run into each other in Siracusa again?

Texas:
I'm busy right now.

Lappland:
What a coincidence, so am I.

Lappland:
Let me guess, your job is to protect this man?

Bellone Bodyguard:
What are you—

Bellone Bodyguard:
Eep...!

Lappland:
Some people really need to learn to read the room. Don't you agree, Texas?

Texas:
Go protect the target. I'll deal with her.

Bellone Bodyguard:
U-Understood!

Lappland:
So, want some mille-feuille?

Texas:
...I'll take a piece.

Lappland:
Haha, now that's more like it!

Lappland:
So, Texas. Whoops, now that we're in Siracusa, I should be calling you Cellinia, right?

Texas:
I'd rather you didn't.

Lappland:
Fine by me. Honestly, I find it easier that way, too. Force of habit can sure be a scary thing, can't it?

Lappland:
Living a leisurely life in Lungmen, occasionally bumping into each other at Rhodes Island, maybe even going on some missions together...

Lappland:
Makes me feel like my swords are gonna go rusty.

Lappland:
This ever-familiar rain is what makes me feel alive.

Texas:
Swords rust in the rain.

Lappland:
In Siracusa, the rain washes away the blood.

Lappland:
Only people like you - who walk around town with your swords out but no intention to use them - need to worry about rust.

Texas:
......

Texas:
Why are you here?

Lappland:
It's simple, really. Because you are.

Lappland:
Hey, Texas, how long has it been since you were last in Siracusa?

Texas:
Probably about ten years now?

Lappland:
Seven years and five months.

Lappland:
For more than seven years, the prodigal daughter of Famiglia Texas has not set foot in Siracusa.

Lappland:
I still remember how your grandfather sent you back here to serve as a hostage. You stayed with Famiglia Saluzzo for a while...

Lappland:
Those days didn't last long, but we sure got along great, didn't we?

Texas:
If that's your idea of 'getting along.'

Lappland:
Even though you're a Columbian, you managed to win the acknowledgment of all of Siracusa's famiglie.

Lappland:
Though, it was truly a shame what happened at the end.

Lappland:
If you ask me, you ought to stay a while this time, and take a good look around.

Texas:
I'm going back as soon as I finish my work here.

Lappland:
Oh. Going back, you say?

Lappland:
Now that you mention it, there's something I've always been curious about, Texas.

Lappland:
You betrayed the Texases and decided to become a lone wolf.

Lappland:
You even abandoned everything the Texases left behind in Columbia. So why do you still go by the name Texas in Lungmen?

Texas:
......

Texas:
That's none of your business.

Texas:
Lappland.

Texas:
I don't plan on staying in Siracusa.

Texas:
I will go back to Lungmen. There are people waiting for me there.

Lappland:
......

Lappland:
Okay then. I'll help you.

Texas:
I don't need your help.

Lappland:
Surely you don't think this is a fight you can take all on your own?

Lappland:
Didn't you find some buddies over in Lungmen? Didn't your time at Rhodes Island teach you that it's okay to rely on others?

Texas:
Siracusa is no place for tourists.

Texas:
If Rhodes Island ever plans to set up a branch office here, I would urge them to reconsider.

Texas:
But most of all, I can't trust <i>you</i>, specifically.

Lappland:
Ah yes, trust.

Lappland:
Texas, you know my family name, right?

Texas:
Saluzzo.

Lappland:
That's right. And we Saluzzos don't place our bets lightly.

Lappland:
You don't need to trust me, but you do need our backing, isn't that right?

Lappland:
Or do you really intend to let the Bellones drag you around by the leash?

Texas:
......

With a deafening boom, the sound of an explosion suddenly tore through the air from not too far away. The flash and flame effortlessly engulfed the government official by the name of Carracci.

Texas:
A car bomb?!

Lappland:
Oh? Now that's a classic.

Bellone Bodyguard:
S-Signor Ministro!

Bellone Bodyguard:
The banquet venue is under attack! All nearby famiglia associates, hurry and back us up!

Texas:
Damnit!

Lappland:
Simultaneous attacks on two fronts? Now that's interesting!

Lappland:
Who would have the guts to pull that off, Texas?

Texas:
Show yourself.

Texas:
...I knew it.

What should I do if I want to go back to Lungmen?

Ever since Texas took her first step back in this city, that question has always been on her mind.

Going by her agreement with Zaaro, the easiest way would be to obey Famiglia Bellone's every command.

But right now, Texas can already vaguely feel that—

The events unfolding in this city are not so simple.

Texas:
Talk. Who sent you?

Assassin:
You don't need to know.

Texas:
......

But she is not worried.

She understands Siracusa well, and knows that there is no end to these things.

She simply feels a twinge of emptiness, one that even she never expected to feel. Because—

No one will come to her aid in this fight.

And after it's over, no one will ask her if she's hurt, or drag her off to some party.

For her, this emptiness has long since been second nature.

So much so that even after leaving Lungmen for such a brief period of time, everything about that city already seems so distant and nostalgic.

Lappland:
But Texas.

Lappland:
The more you want to go back, the more you'll have to cut your ties.

Lappland:
It'll just make you sink deeper and deeper.

Lappland:
What I want to know is, when you finally realize that you're completely covered in mud, what will you do then?

Carwash Worker:
Good to see you again, Your Honor.

Lavinia:
Oh, Danbrown, you're here. Looks like I'm in luck.

Carwash Worker:
You washed your car just last week, didn't you?

Lavinia:
Nothing I can do about it. After all, it's my job to be hated.

Carwash Worker:
Don't worry, I'll get it nice and clean again for you.

Carwash Worker:
Why don't you take a look around while you wait?

Lavinia:
That's alright, I'll just wait here.

Carwash Worker:
......

Lavinia:
......

Carwash Worker:
Your Honor, I heard that judges have it pretty good.

Carwash Worker:
They drive fancy cars, show up on TV, and even the mayor has to be extra-polite around them.

Carwash Worker:
After all, they represent Signora Sicilia's will.

Carwash Worker:
I reckon I don't see any other judges like you, Signorina Lavinia, who get paint thrown on their car every other day.

Lavinia:
You're probably right.

Lavinia:
I don't know about the fancy cars or TV appearances, but I could sure use a membership card to your store right about now.

Carwash Worker:
Sorry, our humble little shop doesn't offer VIP services.

Lavinia:
You look like you're in a better mood than before though. Did that one famiglia stop giving you trouble?

Carwash Worker:
All thanks to you, Your Honor.

Carwash Worker:
I ran into them on the street yesterday, and they all steered clear of me.

Carwash Worker:
Never thought there could be a judge as fair as you in Siracusa.

Lavinia:
Fair, huh... They're just scared of the people behind me, that's all.

Carwash Worker:
You say that, but even if you're backed by Famiglia Bellone, you still doled out punishment to a famiglia well-connected with the Bellones.

Carwash Worker:
In Siracusa, Signora Sicilia is justice itself. I don't know how many of the judges representing the interests of her old famiglie actually bother upholding any <i>real</i> justice.

Carwash Worker:
But deep down in my heart, I know you're the embodiment of justice.

Lavinia:
That isn't actually a compliment.

Lavinia:
Oh right, I almost forgot. You said earlier that you were having trouble sleeping. Did you go see a doctor?

Carwash Worker:
I did. The doc said I didn't have anything wrong with me physically.

Carwash Worker:
Just some mental stress.

Lavinia:
Oh, is something troubling you?

Carwash Worker:
Troubling me...? I wouldn't go that far.

Carwash Worker:
Honestly, this job is basically just a way for me to kill time.

Carwash Worker:
I'm not exactly rich, but I'm not desperate for cash either.

Carwash Worker:
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing, Your Honor. I just don't know.

Carwash Worker:
How do you usually like to pass the time?

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
It's me.

Lavinia:
What?! Carracci was...

Lavinia:
I understand. I'll be right there.

Lavinia:
Sorry, Danbrown. Let's chat some other time.

Lavinia:
As for your question just now—

Lavinia:
I'd recommend giving the theater a shot. I often head down to watch an opera if I have the time to spare.

Danbrown exits the store.

He watches as the judge he deeply respects drive off into the rain, quickly disappearing from sight.

'She's always so busy,' he thinks to himself, drying his rain-beaded gloves on his overalls.

But nothing she does will end up mattering, will it?

Or rather, the fact that she still holds onto hope is precisely the reason why she'll be disappointed again and again.

Things weren't this complicated in the good old days. He looks at the rain falling outside the store, and suddenly remembers an afternoon many years ago.

Carwash Worker:
I hope it rains a little longer, so I won't have to sweep out the garbage in the morning.

Leontuzzo:
Get down!

Rubio:
Eek—!

Capone:
Damn... Thought you were a pampered little princeling, but turns out you're pretty tough to deal with.

Leontuzzo:
Tch, they're no slouches. Stand back, Rubio!

Leontuzzo:
I'm clearly the one they're after!

Rubio:
I, I know!

Rubio:
Eek!

Leontuzzo:
Tch, there's more of 'em over there too!

Leontuzzo:
Out of my way!

Capone:
Slippery bastard.

Gambino:
What?! Isn't that Penguin Logistics'—

Texas:
Hm?

Texas:
Get down.

Rubio:
Ah, okay!

Capone:
You dead, Gambino?

Gambino:
Like I'd kick the bucket so easily. Tch, never expected the real master to show up here.

Capone:
Cut the crap.

Capone:
The mission's botched. Let's split while we still can.

Texas:
I think I remember those two...

Leontuzzo:
*cough* *cough*, *cough* *cough*...

Leontuzzo:
Is everyone... gone now?

Texas:
You alright?

Leontuzzo:
I... think so...

Texas:
You're wounded. Don't move, it's easy to bleed out.

Texas:
I've already called for backup. They'll be here soon.

Leontuzzo:
I'll be fine, but how...

Texas:
How many people would've known about today's banquet?

Leontuzzo:
Are you suggesting...?

Leontuzzo:
You're right. Such a large-scale, coordinated attack must've been planned for a while.

Leontuzzo:
But my identity is public knowledge at this point, and it's not exactly hard to track me down.

Leontuzzo:
In any case, I'm glad you arrived in time.

Texas:
Carracci is dead.

Leontuzzo:
What did you say?!

Wallach:
What?! You've gotta be shitting me...

Rubio:
Carracci is... dead?

Texas:
A car bomb detonated right as he was walking by.

Texas:
Carracci and three bodyguards near him died instantly.

Texas:
Based on the wreckage at the scene, there was no point even taking him to the hospital.

Texas:
I'm sorry.

Leontuzzo:
......

Leontuzzo:
The people who attacked us were without a doubt the same people who murdered Ministro Carracci. What could their objective be...?

Leontuzzo:
Why are you here? There are so many court cars here as well—

Lavinia:
You should've told me sooner that Bellone invited <i>her</i> here.

Lavinia:
Cellinia Texas, as the first witness to the scene of Ministro Carracci's murder, you are also a suspect.

Lavinia:
Now, I'm here to detain you.

Lavinia:
Any resistance will be treated as flouting the laws of Siracusa, and will be punished accordingly.

Texas does not resist. She understands what she sees in the judge's eyes.

Lavinia:
Moreover...

Lavinia:
To all officials and associates of the famiglie, Ministro Carracci's importance to Volsinii is self-evident.

Lavinia:
The attacks carried out on each of you will be investigated as part of the same investigation.

Lavinia:
I, Lavinia Falcone, swear upon my honor to find the identity of the murderer. This shall not go unpunished!

Leontuzzo:
You're not serious, are you?

Lavinia:
Of course I am.

Leontuzzo:
...Alright.

The string of events that just occurred makes Leontuzzo feel a bit fatigued.

And right as this thought crosses his mind, his entire world starts to spin.

Lavinia:
Leon!

The rain continues to fall, with no signs of relenting.
