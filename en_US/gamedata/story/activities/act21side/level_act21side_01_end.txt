Sora:
You don't know the kind of person he is, but <i>I</i> understand him.

Exusiai:
Don't you think we place too much faith in our ability to 'understand' someone? Don't you think we're all too easily blinded by the illusions born of emotion and impulse?

Sora:
Salvadore... He deserves to step out of Columbia's dark alleyways.

Exusiai:
My sister, he is a Siracusan, and you know nothing about how he operates. You really think he could help us get rich?

Exusiai:
All he's gonna do is get himself burnt - and we're gonna get caught in the middle.

Sora:
He uses his fists to protect himself, and then law and order to shackle his fists. Is that not enough for you?

Exusiai:
Get your head out of the clouds already.

Sora:
No, brother. Other Siracusans wear their scars and bloodstains like badges of honor.

Sora:
Only he knows that blood is nothing more than blood.

Exusiai:
So, Sora, how's my acting?

Sora:
Want me to give it to you straight?

Exusiai:
You bet I do.

Sora:
Absolutely terrible! Exusiai, you've got, like, zero talent for this!

Exusiai:
Ehh? I feel like I'm pretty emotionally invested though.

Sora:
Just being emotionally invested doesn't make you a good actor.

Sora:
But... as far as the script is concerned, you're on the right track! At least you aren't flubbing any of your lines.

Exusiai:
How low were your expectations?!

Sora:
What do you think, Croissant?

Croissant:
Pretty darn good, if ya ask me!

Croissant:
Only thing is, when yer expressin' yer dissatisfaction with the brother, think ya could dial the emotions back a notch?

Sora:
Hmm, so try to get the point across some other way? I... can give that a try in a moment.

Exusiai:
Woah, Croissant, since when were you an expert?

Croissant:
Hey, don't go underestimatin' a gal who sits in on Sora's classes every week. Not like a certain two someones who come and go without a word.

Exusiai:
Hey, I'd never leave without saying anything.

Croissant:
Not what I meant...

Exusiai:
But at least this proves we'll be able to find her for sure, right?

Croissant:
Damn straight we will.

???:
Quite the unique performance.

Sora:
Ehh?

Sora:
Excuse me, but are you...

???:
My name is Benthonexigios.

Exusiai:
Oh, hello, Bensomething-or-other...

Ben:
Feel free call me Ben.

Exusiai:
Sure thing, Ben!

Sora:
Um, excuse me, Mr. Ben, if there's nothing you need from us, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave. We're still in the middle of rehearsal.

Ben:
Of course there is. I'm currently watching the performance, am I not?

Sora:
I don't think someone who's walking around eating pizza counts as watching anything.

Ben:
Am I not allowed to watch the performance while enjoying pizza?

Exusiai:
Well, don't theaters usually have rules against that?

Ben:
That's a rule imposed on people by the theater, not by the play itself.

Ben:
Norms have a way of making people superficially conflate these things, and hold them with the same degree of reverence, even erecting false pedestals upon which to elevate them. True reverence, however, is much harder to find.

Exusiai:
Huh?

Ben:
Would you like a bite, young lady?

Exusiai:
You betcha!

Exusiai:
Bleh, the texture's awful!

Ben:
It's the cheapest street pizza you can find, after all. That said, their sauce is actually quite respectable.

Sora:
Um... so if you were watching our performance just now, what'd you think of it?

Ben:
The key takeaway is that there are some differences between the methods of capturing and expressing emotions that you seem to be adept at, versus the demands of opera.

Ben:
You are clearly used to standing in front of an audience. Or should I say, you're so used to it that it makes it hard for you to stand on stage as an actor.

Ben:
That is not an indictment of your abilities, but is nevertheless a trial you must overcome.

Exusiai:
Woah, I didn't expect you to be a total pro at this.

Ben:
Think about it. You are the daughter of a wealthy Columbian magnate. He, Salvadore, is a vagrant from Siracusa.

Ben:
He's different from all the other men you've ever met. He does not care about your status, but values you for who you are.

Ben:
He is more indolent than anyone else, yet also cleverer.

Ben:
He seems destined to become don of a famiglia, setting off on a perilous road from which there is no turning back.

Ben:
Tell me, young lady, is this someone you could love?

Sora:
Someone... I could love...

Ben:
No, you are terrified! The more you love him, the more he terrifies you!

Ben:
You have no chance of keeping him.

Ben:
Your intuition tells you that you should escape. That he never belonged to you.

Sora:
......

Ben:
You've told yourself countless times that he is just another passerby on the road of life. That even if he slips away, you can find innumerable others who are better.

Ben:
You know that if you chase after him, your life will become as a landship in an endless desert, unable to see your course.

Ben:
You don't even know if the decision you made is right or wrong.

Ben:
But despite all that, you still turn to your relatives and yell—

Sora:
'Only he knows that blood is nothing more than blood!'

Croissant:
Wooooah.

Exusiai:
Oooooh!

Sora:
So that's the feeling I've been missing this whole time...

Ben:
Yet you already seem to understand it well, young lady.

Sora:
I...

Sora:
Let's give it another run-through, Exusiai!

Exusiai:
Lemme get a sip of water first—

Croissant:
Haha, ya ain't gettin' away that easy when Sora's in the zone.

Croissant:
I'll go fetch some drinks for y'all. And some grub while I'm at it.

Croissant:
Mr. Ben, anything ya'd—

Croissant:
Huh? Where'd he go?

Witness:
Ah, the police are finally here! Over here, ma'am!

Lavinia:
I'm not the police. I am Lavinia, a municipal judge for Volsinii.

Lavinia:
Siracusa has no police, Signor.

Witness:
What? No police?

Lavinia:
Are you a foreigner? In this country, 'they' are the ones responsible for maintaining law and order on the streets.

Witness:
Who are 'they'? I'm just visiting for some business discussions, so I don't quite understand.

Lavinia:
Hmph. I'm talking about the mafiosi. You'd best steer clear of them.

Witness:
I... I know that much.

Lavinia:
Where's the scene of the crime?

Witness:
T-Take a look for yourself... Right there, behind the dumpster.

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
Five people. They couldn't have died more than a day ago. From their outfits, they seem to be from the same famiglia.

Lavinia:
Hold on...

Witness:
What's wrong, ma'am?

Lavinia:
I saw them... just this morning.

Lavinia:
They attacked a public official earlier. I confronted them about it, but let them go.

Lavinia:
But why here of all places... and their leader isn't with them either.

Witness:
I... I've always heard that Siracusa is a dangerous place.

Lavinia:
No, if this was a conflict between famiglie, they would've made sure to clean up the scene.

Lavinia:
This doesn't make any sense.

Lavinia:
For your own safety, act as if you never saw anything.

Lavinia:
I'll handle the rest here.

Witness:
Y-Yes, ma'am!

Witness:
Damn it, I need to get out of this godforsaken place this instant...

Lavinia:
......

???:
Signorina Lavinia, I didn't expect you to ever call me first.

Lavinia:
Demetri, noticed any flamboyant hitmen around town recently?

Demetri:
Hmm? Huh... You'd have to either be incredibly brave or incredibly stupid to stick your neck out these days.

Lavinia:
...Do you need me to throw last month's crime reports in your face?

Demetri:
I think there's been a little misunderstanding here.

Lavinia:
Just now, five bodies were found in a back alley on Viale Orvieto. The scene wasn't cleaned up, which suggests it wasn't the work of one of the famiglie.

Lavinia:
And just this morning, I saw these same folks attacking a public official.

Demetri:
Huh, now that's new and exciting.

Lavinia:
I don't care about the little power struggle between you people, but don't forget that our ironclad rule still stands.

Demetri:
Setting aside recent developments, even in ordinary times the fact still stands that Volsinii is run by Famiglia Bellone, and has a judge as principled as you.

Demetri:
Pulling a stunt like this is tantamount to spitting in our faces, and nobody would dare do something like that.

Demetri:
Unless...

Lavinia:
Unless they're Columbian. Is that what you wanted to say?

Demetri:
It could be anyone who doesn't give two shits about the rules we've set.

Lavinia:
Just keep me posted if you learn anything.

Demetri:
I don't recall having to answer to you, Your Honor.

Lavinia:
Is this not also 'tantamount to spitting in the face of Famiglia Bellone'?

Demetri:
Fine then, I'll tell Leon. Maybe he has enough spare time on his hands.

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
First, attacks on government officials. Now, hitmen out of nowhere.

Lavinia:
Is there really a connection between these?

The humid air creeps inside.

Lavinia's mind races with the details of the latest case as she makes her way back to the courthouse.

She knows full well what looms overhead, but everyone here, including herself, takes it for granted.

At the entrance to the courthouse, Lavinia looks over at her car, and cannot help but let out a sigh.

It has been splashed with paint, and now stands out conspicuously among its neighbors.

A simple gesture of malice.

These acts used to make her feel at a loss for words, but now they trouble her no more than the continuous drizzle.

Of course, there is still the cost of getting the car cleaned.

Lavinia:
Sorry.

Lappland:
Be careful out there, signorina.

Lappland:
The rain doesn't seem like it'll let up anytime soon. You might slip if you don't watch your step.

Lavinia:
Thanks for the reminder. But you don't seem to have an umbrella either.

Lappland:
I'm not a fan. I rather enjoy the feeling of raindrops on my skin.

Lavinia:
Then I hope you also watch your step.

Lappland:
......

Capone:
Why are you trying to provoke her?

Lappland:
And what makes you think that's what I'm doing? Ohh, you think you've got me all figured out now, huh?

Capone:
Forget I said anything.

Lappland:
I <i>was</i> trying to provoke her, though.

Capone:
......

Lappland:
She had a familiar scent on her. One I hate.

Capone:
Suit yourself. But you're the one who wanted us to break into Famiglia Bellone. And I think this is just making us more suspicious.

Lappland:
I need to know exactly what is happening in this city, and why they wanted to bring Texas back.

Lappland:
So what do you reckon we do? Work our way up from hired guns? Rise through the ranks until we become the Bellones' top hitmen?

Capone:
Well, Gambino'd probably like the sound of that, at least.

Lappland:
That's way too inefficient.

Lappland:
You guys need some bargaining chips, isn't that right?

Lappland:
So where <i>is</i> Gambino?

Capone:
Already on his way to the middleman, to cash in the bounty.

Lappland:
Hah, look at that. Here in Siracusa, he's a lot better than you at climbing the ranks.

Capone:
I don't deny that.

Capone:
After spending so much time in Lungmen, I'm more shocked at how this place hasn't changed a bit. Not used to it at all anymore.

Lappland:
Trust me, you'll get used to it again soon enough. Just like Gambino.

Lappland:
After all, you're a Siracusan.

Capone:
You really gonna let him plant his roots down here again?

Lappland:
Why not? There's nothing stopping you either. Be loud and proud about it. I certainly wouldn't get in your way.

Capone:
The more I think about it, the less I understand. What exactly are you trying to accomplish?

Lappland:
I'm just enjoying the rainy season. What, do you not like the rain?

Capone:
All I know is, Gambino hates the rain.

Capone:
So, what news did you get your hands on?

Lappland:
Wanna find out?

Capone:
Sure, say I do. What would you have me do?

Lappland:
You're in luck. I just happen to be in need of a driver.

Capone:
...*sigh*.

Demetri:
Come on in, signor istigatore.

Gambino:
I came back alive, bartender.

Demetri:
Your skills aren't half bad. But neither you, Gambino, nor that friend of yours who left for Lungmen eight years ago, Capone, are good enough.

Gambino:
Don't start talking like you're some hot shit, cub!

Demetri:
You're just like the rumors said. Completely clueless as to when you should and shouldn't press your luck.

Demetri:
Is that not how the last Sicilians lost the favor of Signora Sicilia?

Demetri:
Look at the ones today. What can they do now, except cling to their last pathetic scrap of glory?

Gambino:
......

Demetri:
Listen up, Gambino. I don't give a shit what you and Capone came back to Siracusa to do, nor do I care who's backing you behind the scenes.

Demetri:
All I care about is your ability, and the kind of work you can do.

Gambino:
So, what do you think of our work then?

Demetri:
You're not one of us, and you've got guts. Both are good.

Demetri:
So you keep doing good work for me, and I pay you. The better you do, the more you get paid. Simple as that.

Demetri:
You want to see Bellone. Once you've satisfied me, I'll arrange a meeting.

Gambino:
I'm going to do such a good job that you'll regret it.

Demetri:
You know, I don't hate the fact that you Sicilians ooze ruthlessness from your bones.

Demetri:
That's something Siracusans could use more of these days.

Demetri:
So, let's see you try.

Demetri:
When the time comes, you'll realize that I never regret a thing.

The banquet is about to begin, and people have been lining up early to wait outside the door.

???:
Welcome, Mr. Beato.

Haughty Official:
And you are?

???:
Rubio. We met at the banquet last week.

Haughty Official:
Ah, I remember now, il Segretario di Sicurezza Alimentare. Rubio. I do apologize for this porous mind of mine.

Haughty Official:
Seeing as you're here, I'm sure tonight's meal is not to be missed.

Rubio:
Hardly, good sir. But as we are expecting some rather esteemed guests tonight, I did put in a little extra effort.

Haughty Official:
I see, I see.

Snobby Official:
Over here, Beato.

Haughty Official:
I'll be right there. Now, if you'll excuse me.

Snobby Official:
Who was that?

Haughty Official:
Rubio, Segretario di Sicurezza Alimentare.

Snobby Official:
What? He's actually a government official, looking like that? I ignored him when I first came in because I thought he was just a doorman.

Haughty Official:
Not that you're missing out on much. He might as well be a clown.

Snobby Official:
Why do you say that?

Haughty Official:
He's not from one of the famiglie, and after a lifetime of struggling, the best position he could claw himself into was the director of that no-name dipartimento.

Haughty Official:
And after he landed the position, he went around kissing the asses of various famiglie until he somehow managed to bumble his way into some renown.

Haughty Official:
Nowadays, his dipartimento pretty much caters all events in Volsinii, large and small.

Haughty Official:
He doesn't care about his image at all, standing in front of the door to greet the guests like that. I mean, you saw him.

Snobby Official:
I see. That said though, there is a thing or two we could learn from his sorry mug.

Rubio:
......

???:
I must congratulate you, Rubio.

Rubio:
Oh my... What might the occasion be?

???:
Word on the street is that young master Leontuzzo will be attending the banquet tonight.

???:
The heir to Famiglia Bellone, the great celebrity by Carracci's side, has never attended a banquet like this before.

???:
This is your big break, isn't it?

Rubio:
Haha... Signor Wallach, you must have been quite pleased with the batch of steaks I sent you the other day.

Rubio:
Otherwise, I'm sure you wouldn't be calling me just to joke around in such a manner.

Wallach:
Hahaha.

Wallach:
Things have changed, Rubio. I may be the boss of Famiglia Rossati in this city and made a bit of a name for myself, but there are still plenty of rules I must abide by.

Wallach:
For example, I have to break the bread of fellowship with a guy like you.

Rubio:
Your support is always appreciated.

Wallach:
It's good that we all treat each other like family. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. If we have any issues, we settle them on the table.

Wallach:
None of us enjoy spending all day fighting and killing each other. It's just, a necessity born of circumstance. Isn't that right?

Rubio:
Indeed. You work too hard these days, Signor Wallach.

Wallach:
Il Ministero dei Trasporti is headed by a Bellone, and he normally keeps his distance from me. Tch, not much I can do to him.

Wallach:
But il Ministro al Commercio is a smart man, a good friend of mine. Naturally, he enjoys the Rossatis' full support.

Wallach:
The host of tonight's banquet, Carracci, Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici, is an unpredictable man, though. Even though he's got Bellone's little pup following him around, he manages to stay on decent terms with everyone.

Wallach:
Rubio, food safety is very important, is it not? I do hope you are also a smart man.

Rubio:
Of course, of course.

Rubio:
The VIP arrived just now. Excuse me, I must be off.

Wallach:
See you.

Texas:
......

Leontuzzo:
I know how strong you are, Signorina Texas. Unfortunately, I am not a man who enjoys resorting to violence.

Leontuzzo:
Using force is the least efficient method.

Leontuzzo:
So if you were expecting to leave Siracusa after making a few heads roll on my behalf, I'm afraid you'll be quite disappointed.

Texas:
Just... tell me what I need to do.

Leontuzzo:
Carracci, Volsinii's Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici.

Leontuzzo:
He is responsible for the construction of the new nomadic city plate. He's also one of our men, and I need you to protect him.

Texas:
A government official?

Leontuzzo:
I know what you're going to say.

Leontuzzo:
'The government is just the cloth draped over Grey Hall's round table.'

Leontuzzo:
Every associate of every famiglia remembers Signora Sicilia's lament.

Leontuzzo:
There was once a time when we never took stock of the vases and cutlery sitting on our tablecloth.

Leontuzzo:
But right now, it's something we must pay close attention to.

Leontuzzo:
When the Columbians brought new things back with them, what disturbed me most was not their technology, but rather...

Leontuzzo:
How they do things nothing like we do in Siracusa.

Leontuzzo:
They knew that Siracusa's officials were never going to turn their backs on the old guard of the famiglie, so they never required those officials to defer to them in public.

Leontuzzo:
All they needed was for them to turn a blind eye at just the right moment, or whenever it was convenient for them.

Leontuzzo:
And what can we do? Getting rid of those officials won't solve anything.

Leontuzzo:
Try to settle things with them directly? They're not stupid enough to give the game away.

Leontuzzo:
Despite the not-insignificant amount of power and influence we have here, there is nothing we can do about them.

Leontuzzo:
I believe that you, having spent a number of years living in Lungmen, should be more familiar with their way of doing things.

Texas:
...To the point I almost thought I was back in Lungmen.

Leontuzzo:
Hah. But here in Siracusa, few people even realize how big the shockwaves from the Columbian approach might end up being.

Leontuzzo:
You know, Signorina Texas, when I really dove into the nitty-gritty of this approach, to better understand it, the only thing I felt was...

Leontuzzo:
Admiration.

Leontuzzo:
The weapons they deploy are profits and negotiations, not violence and bloodshed.

Texas:
So you also studied their methods.

Leontuzzo:
Studied? No... I'll do it better than them.

Leontuzzo:
And Carracci is my trump card.

Leontuzzo:
Recently, there's been a sudden outbreak of assassinations on government officials around the city. Though I haven't confirmed who's behind the attacks yet, I must ensure the safety of Ministro Carracci.

Leontuzzo:
He's an interesting man, and prefers to walk over taking the car. Even though I have people protecting him in secret, I do not feel at ease.

Leontuzzo:
Now, I've already given them a heads up. Go bring him over to the banquet venue.

Texas:
......

Texas:
(The target is crossing the street right ahead. There should be at least seven mafiosi covering him from the shadows.)

Texas:
(Seems like there won't be any major issues...)

Texas:
(?!)

Lappland:
Would you look at that. Didn't I just say something good was about to happen?

Lappland:
Texas, care for some mille-feuille?
