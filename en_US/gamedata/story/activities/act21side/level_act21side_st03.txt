Rubio's Daughter:
Oh, you really came, Judge Lavinia!

Lavinia:
You must be Segretario Rubio's daughter, yes?

Rubio's Daughter:
Yeah! I thought my father was just joking around when he said you'd come babysit me!

Rubio's Daughter:
My friends and I all adore you.

Rubio's Daughter:
Compared to people like my father, you're like, the only clean person in the government.

Lavinia:
Do you not get along well with your father?

Rubio's Daughter:
Meh, so-so, I guess.

Rubio's Daughter:
I still like him as a person, because he always makes time for me and plays with me a lot.

Rubio's Daughter:
But you know, I think people like him, who only care about protecting themselves and not rocking the boat, really should have bigger goals in life.

Rubio's Daughter:
His old work friends who started out on the same level as him are way up there now.

Rubio's Daughter:
It took him this long to land a half-decent job, and he doesn't want to do anything more with it.

Lavinia:
His old work friends?

Rubio's Daughter:
Yeah, one of them was Carracci, Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici, who just died not too long ago.

Lavinia:
It's a dangerous job.

Rubio's Daughter:
I know... But, I saw him on TV every day, and wise guys from all the big famiglie treated him really well.

Rubio's Daughter:
I dunno, I just think it doesn't make sense trying to be a politician if you can't make it to that level.

Lavinia:
That might be true.

Rubio's Daughter:
So, that's why I was really surprised when my father suddenly decided to become the new Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici.

Rubio's Daughter:
I'm not sure what finally made things click for him... But if he did it sooner, my mother probably wouldn't have divorced him.

Lavinia:
Divorced?

Rubio's Daughter:
Yeah, she thought he was a good-for-nothing, so she left him a few years ago.

Rubio's Daughter:
But my mother has a temper, so I decided to stay with my father.

Rubio's Daughter:
Oh, by the way, you know how he got appointed ministro, right? Can you tell me more about it?

Lavinia:
Sorry, I actually don't know anything...

Rubio's Daughter:
Aww, okay then.

Rubio's Daughter:
Anyway, you can sit anywhere you'd like.

Rubio's Daughter:
I'm not going anywhere today, but I do want to listen to my father's inaugural speech.

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
(Segretario Rubio... keeps his room tidier than I would've expected.)

Rubio's Daughter:
You're surprised too, huh? He probably seems like he'd be a total slob, but he keeps things pretty organized.

Rubio's Daughter:
Oh right, and he keeps a diary.

Lavinia:
Really?

Rubio's Daughter:
Yeah, lemme think... Right, he keeps it over here.

Rubio's Daughter:
He only writes in it when he feels like it. It's not an every day thing.

Rubio's Daughter:
After years of jotting stuff down, he's still got all these blank pages.

Lavinia:
Does he not care if you snoop around his things?

Rubio's Daughter:
It's totally fine. He left it there because he doesn't mind people reading it.

Rubio's Daughter:
I've flipped through it a few times, but it's all boring stuff. I'd call it like, chronicles of a middle-aged man? Boring, it drags on and on.

Rubio's Daughter:
You can take a look if you want.

Lavinia:
......

Bellone Mafioso:
Signor Rubio, this is where you'll be giving your speech.

Rubio:
Please leave me.

Bellone Mafioso:
But we've got orders to protect you.

Rubio:
Nobody could get in here, right?

Bellone Mafioso:
Right. Okay.

Rubio:
......

Rubio:
Hmph. Power, huh.

Rubio:
Now I'll barricade the door with the sofa... This is about as much as I can do.

Rubio:
Okay...

Rubio:
Well, Carracci, I won't keep you waiting much longer. See you soon.

Exusiai:
How's it looking?

Sora:
The doctor says the strike just missed her heart by a few centimeters, so she didn't die instantly.

Sora:
But, she's still in really bad shape.

Sora:
Where's Texas?

Exusiai:
Umm...

Texas:
......

Exusiai:
She's been in a stupor ever since she got back yesterday.

Exusiai:
She just sits there motionless. Won't even respond when I ask if she wants to eat.

Sora:
Just give her some time. Croissant and I will guard the hospital, so please take care of her.

Exusiai:
No need to worry about me. You two look after yourselves.

Exusiai:
*sigh*... So bored.

Exusiai:
Oh right, I heard there was supposed to be some speech today?

Exusiai:
Maybe I'll give it a listen.

Radio:
Buongiorno, my dear friends and citizens.

Radio:
I imagine most of you don't know much about me, and I can't blame you for that.

Radio:
After all, I came held very minor and unimportant role of Segretario di Sicurezza Alimentare before this.

Radio:
In fact, I believe that most of our dear citizens, apart from the late Ministro Carracci and the honorable Judge Lavinia, know very little about our government.

Radio:
I do not know Judge Lavinia very well, but I do have somewhat of a history with the late Ministro Carracci.

Radio:
I believe it would be appropriate to begin my speech with him, a figure everyone here should already be familiar with.

Radio:
Carracci and I both joined L'Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato around the same time.

Radio:
He was strong and energetic, taking care of the fieldwork while I handled the paperwork behind the scenes.

Radio:
He became known within the system for his bold words and actions, and he even dared to challenge prominent famiglie.

Radio:
To be perfectly honest, it seemed like the guy was indomitable. He was almost taken out a few times by dissatisfied famiglie, but managed to weather the storm or push through the situation.

Radio:
But at the time, L'Autorità staff saw him as a pain, and nobody wanted to help him.

Radio:
So the job of reporting to him naturally fell to me, unpopular as I was.

Radio:
And let me tell you, that job took a whole lot out of me.

Radio:
But at the same time, it filled me with a sense of accomplishment.

Radio:
Though I could never be as direct and straightforward as him, I could do what I wanted to do through him vicariously, and that was a reward in itself.

Radio:
Throughout this process, the two of us became fairly well-acquainted.

Bernardo:
Leon, you were working with Carracci for the last two years, and I know you thought highly of him.

Bernardo:
Does this account match with what you knew of him?

Leontuzzo:
He certainly was energetic.

Leontuzzo:
He knew exactly how to deal with the famiglie, and that went beyond just being tactful. He knew how to help them under the table while also getting them to serve his interests.

Leontuzzo:
A lot of what he wanted to do would've been blocked by various famiglie, but in his hands, he always managed to get things done, step by step.

Bernardo:
I can tell you learned a lot from him.

Leontuzzo:
I just thought there were some similarities in the way I saw things and the way he operated.

Leontuzzo:
The days when problems can be solved with fighting and killing are over, padre mio.

Leontuzzo:
If the famiglie are going to survive, they have to adapt accordingly.

Bernardo:
You still don't understand, Leon.

Leontuzzo:
What do I not understand?

Bernardo:
You've subconsciously lumped yourself in with Lavinia and Carracci.

Bernardo:
But don't ever forget, you are not one of them.

Leontuzzo:
I know.

Bernardo:
If you really knew, you wouldn't be standing here.

Bernardo:
Unfortunately, you're out of time.

Leontuzzo:
Padre?

Bernardo:
Leon, if you get through this alive...

Bernardo:
It's what it is.

......

Radio:
Even though he was a thorn in the side of many famiglie, his talents were evident to all.

Radio:
And so, he rose through the ranks long before I did.

Radio:
In fact, I thought he wouldn't last long after his promotion.

Radio:
I used to think that, because he was never in a place where too many different interests overlapped, he wouldn't face any serious attempts on his life.

Radio:
If he kept behaving the same way he always did as he rose through the ranks, sooner or later, he was bound to step on toes that he could not afford to step on.

Radio:
I was wrong.

Rubio's Daughter:
I never knew my father could be such a talkative person.

Rubio's Daughter:
What do you think, Judge Lavinia?

Rubio's Daughter:
Judge Lavinia?

Lavinia seems completely oblivious to the calls of Rubio's daughter.

She is engrossed in the words of the diary in her hands.

Lavinia:
Rubio, you...

Radio:
In fact, in our system, there is no shortage of people with the same fundamental intentions as Carracci.

Radio:
However, for various reasons, they finally chose to submit to these famiglie, even becoming their cronies.

Radio:
But Carracci was different. Not only did he not give in, he was always looking for ways to fight against them.

Radio:
And, his efforts paid off.

Radio:
He did not die as easily as I thought he would, and he even managed to climb higher.

Radio:
And when we met again at a banquet, he said something that I will never forget—

Radio:
'The famiglie these days are weak.'

Exusiai:
This dude's pretty brave...

Exusiai:
Huh?

Exusiai:
Umm... Texas, there seems to be something happening outside. Lemme go check it out.

Texas:
......

Texas:
Exusiai.

Exusiai:
Huh?

Texas:
Do you think... we could bring Giovanna back to Lungmen?

Exusiai:
Why not?

Exusiai:
She seems fun.

Exusiai:
But, it doesn't feel like that's what you think. Right?

Texas turns her eyes to the table by the window, upon which a necklace sits.

It was a symbol of trust from Signora Sicilia.

A gift that Giovanna left for her.

In her grandfather's eyes, the Columbian famiglie had soured.

They'd do anything for the sake of profit, getting involved in the lowest businesses, committing murders with no morals at all.

In her father's eyes, the Siracusan famiglie had decayed.

Passing up profit and opportunity, not fighting for their interests, limiting their progress for the sake of supposed morality. All of it was the pinnacle of stupidity.

In Texas's eyes, her father and grandfather were right and wrong.

If... If she is only angry about what happened to Giovanna,

then she could leave just like she did seven years ago, only this time bringing Giovanna with her.

However, when she got news of her grandfather's death, when she turned a blind eye to the carwash worker, when she turned her back on her father's orders to help, the only thought on her mind was—

There's no end to it all.

Radio:
He showed me how to deal with the famiglie in a comically simple way—

Radio:
He offered them goods they couldn't refuse. Benefits.

Radio:
It's not as if the famiglie couldn't take what he had.

Radio:
But what they always lacked was a great manager. They only knew how to plunder, but never actually learned how to govern.

Radio:
Relying on his outstanding abilities, he gradually became a celebrity to several prominent famiglie.

Radio:
And when they fought over who would fill the role of Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici, he became the candidate that everyone was happy with.

Radio:
Having said all this, I'm sure a lot of you will have questions—

Radio:
You might think Carracci sounds like a guy who played both sides.

Radio:
But what I'd like to say is, in a country like Siracusa, a country rooted in evil, it has never been possible for a good person to exist.

Radio:
To put it mildly, we are all evil.

Rubio's Daughter:
Should he be saying stuff like that in an inaugural speech?

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
......

Exusiai:
Ugh, I knew we should've relocated as soon as we could.

Exusiai:
But we're just gonna have to work with this, considering everything that happened yesterday.

Mafioso:
Gah, that Sankta's a pain in the ass.

Mafioso:
It's just one woman! Surround her!

Exusiai:
My trusty partner here is trying to relax, so mind keeping it down?

Exusiai:
Ugh, you guys sure love raising hell, don't you?

Exusiai:
Oh, if anyone else was here, they'd probably be like, 'But Exusiai, you also love raising hell too!'

Exusiai:
It sure sucks having to do this alone.

Lappland:
What's this? Someone need a helping hand?

Exusiai:
I've been wondering, do you, like... have way too much time on your hands?

Lappland:
I'm just like you. We're all waiting for an answer.

Exusiai:
What do you mean by that?

Exusiai:
Does it make a big difference to you whether or not Texas goes back to Lungmen?

Lappland:
Absolutely.

Lappland:
And as of right now, I want her to go back.

Exusiai:
Hmm... Does that mean you're on our side?

Lappland:
Sure does.

Exusiai:
Great. Can't party alone.

Radio:
Sorry, sorry. I shouldn't have said all that depressing stuff.

Radio:
However, it should be clear to everyone by now that I'm not here to give an inaugural speech.

Radio:
I came here to speak from my heart.

Radio:
Carracci, as bold as his vision was, never mentioned anything to me about his outlook regarding the new city.

Radio:
The reason for that is, when he took up his position, he was already prepared to die.

Radio:
We've all borne witness to what he did over the past two years.

Radio:
And just when I thought he might make it long enough to see the birth of the new city, he suddenly died a few days ago.

Radio:
As for me, that was the last straw.

Radio:
So, I cozied up to Famiglia Bellone, recommended myself to them, and obtained this position.

Radio:
In that process, I discovered a shocking conspiracy the Bellone and Saluzzo famiglie have been brewing—

Radio:
From the very beginning, they plotted to plunge this city into chaos and seize the newly-built nomadic city.

Radio:
Then, they will seek to leverage it against Signora Sicilia.

Loyal Mafioso:
Don Alberto, this—

Alberto:
......

Alberto:
Any news from Bernardo yet?

Loyal Mafioso:
No, Don Alberto.

Alberto:
What's the meaning of this, Bernardo?

Alberto:
Danbrown.

Carwash Worker:
......

Alberto:
Danbrown!

Carwash Worker:
...I'm here.

Alberto:
You're near Rubio's location, right?

Carwash Worker:
Yes.

Alberto:
Whack that lunatic.

Carwash Worker:
Yes, Don Alberto.

Rubio:
Alright... I guess I can't keep you out, if you really want to come in.

Carwash Worker:
You're an idiot.

Carwash Worker:
What's the point of all this?

Carwash Worker:
......

Rubio:
The way you're dressed... Are you an ordinary worker?

Carwash Worker:
I work at a carwash. It's called 'Auto Lavaggio Danbrown.'

Rubio:
Oh, that rings a bell.

Carwash Worker:
Yes.

Rubio:
So, you must be Danbrown then?

Carwash Worker:
That's me.

Rubio:
Do you have any particular concerns about your job?

Carwash Worker:
No.

Carwash Worker:
Siracusa's gotten soggy and stale. I've had nothing to do, so I found some work for myself.

Rubio:
That's a shame. You should've looked a little harder.

Rubio:
You arrogant wise guys think you can lord over us forever.

Rubio:
You think your only enemies are each other, you never take any of us seriously.

Rubio:
But, the times are changing. Nothing stays the same forever.

Carwash Worker:
No matter how nice your words might sound, they're just words.

Carwash Worker:
Can words overthrow the famiglie, or Signora Sicilia?

Rubio:
No, but I've taken this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and said what I needed to say.

Rubio:
As for who'll win between the Bellones and Signora Sicilia, I don't know, or care.

Rubio:
All I know is—this new era has no room for the likes of you.

Rubio:
If the next chapter of Siracusan history is about to be written, the heroes of that story won't be the famiglie.

Rubio:
We may have no power. We may indeed be weak.

Rubio:
But we know that civilization rose to overcome this savagery.

Rubio:
We pursue a form of equality, an order not rooted in violence.

Carwash Worker:
Violence is in our nature.

Rubio:
Really now? Why, then, are all the famiglie moving in the same direction?

Rubio:
Why are they chasing money and power instead of violence and conflict?

Rubio:
Is killing me today just a cathartic release of this violence?

Rubio:
Or is it because... I got in the way of the people behind you taking power?

Carwash Worker:
......

Rubio:
See, you already know the answer.

Rubio:
And, if you don't mind, I'd like to be the one to finish myself off.

Rubio:
Do you know what this is?

Carwash Worker:
A gun?

Rubio:
That's right. I purchased it from Blacksteel a few years ago, through my connections.

Rubio:
It's hard to use, and it's not very useful against a pack of wise guys lunging at you.

Rubio:
All it can do is offer a little protection to one as weak as myself.

Rubio:
By the looks of things, I already figured out who I should be pointing it at years ago.

Rubio:
......

Rubio slowly raises the gun's muzzle to his temple.

Rubio:
Oh right, Danbrown.

Rubio:
I hope that one day, you can just be a regular carwash worker here in Siracusa. One who never has to hold a weapon, ever again.

Lavinia:
......

Rubio's Daughter:
Judge Lavinia, am I dreaming? Why is my father... talking with a hitman like that?

Rubio's Daughter:
No, father! He's in danger!

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia feels tears welling up in her eyes.

But she does not have time to wipe them, because she already has a premonition in her heart.

She moves to Rubio's daughter and gently covers her ears.

The inhabitants of Volsinii will never forget this day.

On a clear morning, the crisp clarion call of a pistol's muzzle reverberates across Volsinii through every radio.

Former Volsinii Segretario di Sicurezza Alimentare Rubio died during his inaugural speech, taking over as Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici.

The chaos that ensued, though it would be subdued before half a day's time, in fact became the first step toward a new era for Siracusa.
