As far as she was concerned, she's always lived life the exact same way. But, to other people—

She was just like a Siracusan.

Was she just like a Siracusan?

She didn't know.

All she remembers is what she once said to her grandfather:

'People who keep going on and on about how life in Siracusa is nobler, or about life in Columbia is nobler, are all full of it.'

To which he laughed heartily.

Radio:
The high-profile case of Ministro Carracci's assassination is about to be heard in court.

Radio:
But it seems that only a small number of invitees are being allowed inside the courtroom, for security reasons.

Radio:
Everyone else is waiting around the rione della giustizia for the outcome of the trial.

Radio:
The courthouse is encircled by guards, but nevertheless, a large crowd has formed.

Radio:
It appears the death of Ministro Carracci has touched the hearts of the citizenry.

Radio:
We will continue to report on this situation as it develops, so stay tuned.

Sora:
......

Exusiai:
Sora, are you ready?

Sora:
Mhm.

Sora:
You two can go, if you want, while I'm performing.

Exusiai:
That's alright. Even if we showed up, it's not like we'd be able to get in.

Croissant:
Yeah, all we can do is sit tight and wait for the verdict.

Exusiai:
And you break a leg out there.

Sora:
Don't worry about me. I'm already in the right headspace.

Actress:
Sora, are you ready? Almost time for curtain.

Sora:
Be right there!

Volsinii Courthouse

Lavinia:
Quiet, please. Court is now in session.

Lavinia:
The outcome of today's trial will be made public to all citizens of Volsinii.

Lavinia:
The case being heard today is the assassination of Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici, Carracci.

Lavinia:
Bring the defendant to the stand.

Curious Spectator:
So... that's Texas?

Noisy Spectator:
Look at the color of her eyes and hair. There's no mistaking it! She's a Texas!

???:
......

???:
Zzz......

Curious Spectator:
How is she still alive?

Noisy Spectator:
She murdered Carracci?

Lavinia:
Silence!

Lavinia:
......

Texas:
......

Lavinia:
Cellinia Texas, you were present at the murder of Ministro Carracci.

Texas:
I was.

Texas:
I planted the bomb and detonated it as il Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici was walking by.

Curious Spectator:
She straight up admitted it?!

Noisy Spectator:
This is the last Texas...? How the mighty have fallen!

Lavinia:
What was your motive?

Texas:
I had none.

Lavinia:
Who gave you the order?

Texas:
No one.

Lavinia:
In other words, you acted alone?

Texas:
Yes.

Critical Juror:
Impossible! How'd you get your hands on a bomb, and when did you have the opportunity to plant it?

Texas:
Does that matter?

Suspicious Juror:
Did you come to take revenge for Famiglia Texas?

Texas:
No.

Suspicious Juror:
But...

Texas:
Your Honor, I've confessed to everything.

Texas:
I believe there's no need for these two mafiosi in the juror's box to be so rowdy.

Critical Juror:
How dare you!

Texas:
Can we just skip all the boring procedures?

Demetri:
Huh?

Demetri:
Leon, what are you still doing here?

Demetri:
I thought you'd be at the courthouse.

Leontuzzo:
Is it really so surprising, Demetri?

Demetri:
Would you like a drink?

Demetri:
Let's skip the morning booze. I'll prepare some refreshing fruit juice for you.

Leontuzzo:
Get me a whiskey, the strongest we have.

Leontuzzo:
And then, answer my question.

Demetri:
How'd you guess?

Leontuzzo:
Simple.

Leontuzzo:
The attack on me and the assassination of Carracci both prove that someone wants the Dodici Famiglie at each other's throats.

Leontuzzo:
And as Lavinia is a Bellone spokeswoman on the topic, she can't be allowed to find the murderer, or she would be able to bring the situation under control.

Leontuzzo:
Therefore, now that Lavinia has arrested Cellinia, the other side can't let the trial proceed.

Leontuzzo:
So, what has to happen to Lavinia?

Leontuzzo:
Fortunately, things didn't work out for you.

Demetri:
You might not have realized it yet, but she's already influenced you a great deal.

Demetri:
It's making you question your decisions more and more.

Demetri:
And through her influence on you, she might come to believe that she's capable of something.

Demetri:
I have to nip that flight of fancy in the bud.

Leontuzzo:
Funny how you talk all confident-like.

Demetri:
Actually, Leon.

Demetri:
Doing this brings me no joy, or peace of mind.

Demetri:
I didn't want to wait to the very end to tell you the outcome and force you to accept it.

Demetri:
So, it's just like you said. Fortunately, things didn't work out for me.

Leontuzzo:
But that didn't stop you.

Leontuzzo:
We can take all the time in the world settling this score.

Leontuzzo:
Speaking of which, the safest option was to have Cellinia die mysteriously on the eve of the trial, but that didn't happen.

Leontuzzo:
Proving... that the other side is afraid of her.

Leontuzzo:
After all, even if we set aside her being the last Texas, she's still a guest of the Don.

Leontuzzo:
In other words, the only ones willing to let this opportunity slip by... are from this famiglia.

Leontuzzo:
Lo and behold, nobody made any attempts on Cellinia's life yesterday.

Demetri:
What if the other side anticipated your trap and purposefully held off?

Leontuzzo:
If they're set on challenging Signora Sicilia's authority, you'd expect there to be a lot of commotion. So I did a bit of research into which famiglie have been the most active over the last couple days.

Leontuzzo:
And it turns out... You, Demetri, are behind all of this.

Demetri:
......

Demetri:
I must admit, I did not expect Signorina Cellinia to stand trial for someone else's crime.

Demetri:
I figured it wouldn't make a difference whether or not she was involved in our plan, but by the looks of things, I really should have thought that part through.

Leontuzzo:
Don't be too hard on yourself. If she didn't come out and say she was fine bearing the stain of this crime, I wouldn't have thought of it either.

Demetri:
So in that case, you should show her your gratitude.

Leontuzzo:
Of course I will. But before that, I have to ask: why, Demetri?

Demetri:
Isn't it obvious? I'm the traitor in the famiglia.

Leontuzzo:
I'd be more willing to believe that everyone else is a traitor before you.

Leontuzzo:
If I can't trust you, then who?

Demetri:
......

Demetri:
Leon, what do you think about this new nomadic city?

Leontuzzo:
Obviously, it's a new way of dividing up the spoils.

Leontuzzo:
Whoever has the last laugh will be the big winner.

Demetri:
Sure, but I see it more as a testing ground for Signora Sicilia.

Demetri:
Let the Dodici Famiglie fight amongst each other here in the name of building a new city.

Demetri:
The new generation of cubs vent their repressed violence, while the old wolves turn their eyes to a new prize.

Demetri:
Pretty great, huh? With Columbia's return to the fold, the stagnant cesspool that is Siracusa gets a new lease on life.

Demetri:
No matter who wins in the end, it all works out for the woman at the top of Grey Hall, Signora Sicilia.

Leontuzzo:
Wait, you don't mean...

Demetri:
You've done a great job these past few years. You suppressed the other famiglie, and took control of il Ministero dei Lavori Pubblici.

Demetri:
If things keep going that way, the Bellones will get that last laugh.

Demetri:
But what will it accomplish?

Demetri:
Our famiglia gets absolute control over the new nomadic city, and after that, it's back to business as usual.

Leontuzzo:
And you want more than that. Or rather, <i>he</i> wants more than that?

Demetri:
Since Grey Hall was established, since the Dodici Famiglie were prohibited from warring against one another, who has ever really been content?

Demetri:
We used to be hungry, unscrupulous wolves, and the struggles between our famiglie were bloody and endless.

Demetri:
But now, the newest generation of cubs is all nice and comfy in their shackles.

Demetri:
They're used to coexisting with other famiglie. They find solutions to conflicts. They argue with each other in Grey Hall over what you call dividing up the spoils.

Demetri:
We never did any of that. No need to.

Leontuzzo:
So he wants to overthrow the Grey Hall?! But how?

Demetri:
One individual has allowed the famiglie to act independently, but she will never permit them to violate her ironclad law. There can't be any fighting in broad daylight.

Demetri:
We were about to win, and only under these conditions could our sudden fall from power get the attention of the jealous famiglie.

Demetri:
Wolves fight. That's nature. They don't hold back at the smell of blood, no matter how domesticated they've become.

Demetri:
They tear into each other, claws, fangs, and all.

Demetri:
That's how we get this particular individual to step out of Grey Hall.

Demetri:
And we'll all be waiting for that one moment.

Leontuzzo:
......

'Crack.' The crisp sound of glass shattering echoes across the empty room.

The pup is unaware of the wounds caused by the splinters.

Demetri:
We'll get the last laugh, Leon.

Demetri:
And when we do, we'll control more than just a new city. We'll have all of Siracusa.

Demetri:
That's what your father, Bernardo Bellone, who single-handedly made the Bellones the most powerful of the Dodici Famiglie, wants for us.

Leontuzzo:
......

Leontuzzo:
You're wrong.

Demetri:
Huh?

Leontuzzo:
I haven't stopped you. Or I guess I should say, you still have a backup plan, right?

Leontuzzo:
You knew from the very beginning that you'd be found out, so you waited here for me on purpose.

Demetri:
The reason I'm here... is because I figured I had to face up to your anger.

Demetri:
I owe you an apology, both as your closest friend, and as your soldier.

Demetri:
I don't expect you to forgive me, but I at least want you to know that I didn't sleep well doing what I did.

Leontuzzo:
Stop talking like you're giving a victory speech!

Demetri:
...I lost, Leon. Really.

Demetri:
But maybe, this is just the kind of place Siracusa is. Just maybe, the Don's ambitions were right.

Demetri:
Just as I was about to admit defeat, she appeared.

Leontuzzo:
Who?

Demetri:
A lunatic.

Lappland:
Tell me, Gambino. Can you guess the best way to ruin somebody's day?

Gambino:
Huh? Take his head clean off, right?

Lappland:
What do you think, Capone?

Capone:
Find his friends and family. Kill 'em one by one, sit him down, and treat him to a slideshow with their pictures.

Lappland:
*sigh*... That's why I always say you two will never amount to anything.

Gambino:
Hah, then let's hear your bright idea.

Lappland:
His faith, my friends. His faith.

Capone:
You destroy his faith?

Lappland:
Destroy? No, how could you destroy a man's faith with your hands? That can't be done.

Lappland:
But you give him a gentle push, and let him watch his faith fall right out of the sky.

Lappland:
It shatters into a million little pieces.

Capone:
And how do you get a man to shatter his faith so easily?

Lappland:
Oh, no, no. You misunderstand me. Faith is pure and clean, but life is filthy.

Lappland:
'So easily'?

Lappland:
A better question is, how could it be hard?

Capone:
So... does this have somethin' to do with us gettin' you that truck.

Gambino:
Hah, I get it. You're gonna run over that judge to shake Texas up, right?

Lappland:
Does she come across as the kind of woman who'd break down over one dead judge?

Capone:
What are you gonna do then?

Demetri:
You're the Lappland who was exiled from Famiglia Saluzzo. Why are you here in Volsinii?

Demetri:
Wait, how'd you even get back into Siracusa?!

Lappland:
You know how the Bellones have a connection with Cellinia that nobody knows about? I got me a connection with the Saluzzo name that'd make you retch.

Demetri:
So, you're here on their behalf?

Lappland:
You could say that.

Lappland:
By the way, I think you should probably put the weapons you have under the table.

Lappland:
Dying here won't do you or your plans any good.

Demetri:
......

Lappland:
Let's make a deal, Bellone cub.

Lappland:
You want the case dismissed, don't you?

Lappland:
I can help with that.

Demetri:
Is that... what Alberto Saluzzo wants?

Lappland:
I'm his daughter, and I know him better than anyone.

Lappland:
Haven't you been dying to find out exactly what I'm doing back in Siracusa?

Lappland:
It's simple. I need her to understand...

Lappland:
That Siracusa is a swamp. You don't get to just wade your way out.

Lappland:
That goes for all of us.

Lavinia:
As such, you confess to having committed all the aforementioned acts?

Texas:
I was.

Lavinia:
Very well. I hereby proclaim that Cellinia Texas is guilty of murdering Ministro Carracci, Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici.

Lavinia:
I pronounce you—

Critical Juror:
What's going on?

Suspicious Juror:
What was that sound? Anybody else hear that?

Critical Juror:
It's... an engine?

Suspicious Juror:
But we're in a courthouse. How could that—

For the mafiosi of yesteryear, the unspoken rules were held above all else.

Signora Sicilia placed the shackles of the law around the necks of the famiglie.

Thus, a court of law was erected in every Siracusan city.

In Siracusa, the courts stand for Grey Hall's will.

And the judges are executors of Signora Sicilia's will.

The judges inevitably find themselves controlled by the famiglie, sometimes even submitting to them. However, every judge knows there is one line that cannot be crossed—

They must prevent fights between the Dodici Famiglie.

Just as the Dodici all know their every move is always under the watchful eye of Signora Sicilia.

Thus, a delicate balance of power is established through the courts.

But now—

A declaration of contempt for Signora Sicilia.

A mockery of the very laws of Siracusa.

With an engine's roar squeezed between bouts of high-pitched laughter...

A truck rips through the wall.

And even after crashing its way inside, the engine does not stop.

As if proclaiming to others—

This is no mere accident, but rather by design.

Critical Juror:
Aaaaaaahhh—

Suspicious Juror:
Wh-What's going on?! What's a truck doing here?!

Lavinia:
Who's the driver? Get out of there this instant!

Lappland:
Heh, not bad. Now that's the face I wanted to see.

Lavinia:
Who the hell are you?!

Lappland:
Ah, yes. Buongiorno, signore e signori.

Lappland:
Allow me to introduce myself.

Lappland:
My name... is Lappland Saluzzo.

Lavinia:
Saluzzo?!

Radio:
Breaking news!

Radio:
Just now, someone drove a truck into the courtroom.

Radio:
The woman who carried out this jaw-dropping deed just identified herself as Lappland Saluzzo.

Radio:
And, she claims to be the one who really assassinated Carracci!

Radio:
At present, Judge Lavinia has suspended the trial and detained this individual.

Radio:
We will continue to track the latest developments, so don't go anywhere—

Ben:
When people no longer recognize the stench of blood as blood, it becomes a natural part of society.

Ben:
Let this be a poignant wake-up call.

Ben:
In a city where even the sewers are choked with conspiracy and spilled blood, such fascinating developments can still take place.

Ben:
O wolf with a yearning for the wilderness, you never fail to surprise.

Ben:
But will you break free of your shackles? That, I do wish to see.

Over a dozen mobsters lie on the ground, howling.

The only one still standing is a girl holding a longbow.

???:
I never knew city wolves were this weak.

???:
Agnese was right.

She pauses briefly, then suddenly turns to sniff the air.

It's coming from the direction of the warehouse.

???:
Are there other wolves from the wilds in this city?

???:
No... This is not the scent of the wilderness.

???:
But, it's very close to it.
