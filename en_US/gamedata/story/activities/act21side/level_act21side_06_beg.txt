Leontuzzo:
Urgh...

Mafioso:
Signor, are you alright?

Leontuzzo:
Just dreaming.

Leontuzzo:
That's why you shouldn't sleep on the sofa.

Leontuzzo:
Where's the old man?

Mafioso:
The Don went to the theater.

Leontuzzo:
......

Mafioso:
Are you going too?

Leontuzzo does not answer, only sinking deeper into the sofa.

Texas:
Rossati, Giovanna.

Bernardo:
That's right.

Bernardo:
Cellinia, our original agreement was to ensure the Bellones come out on top.

Bernardo:
But, I've changed my mind.

Bernardo:
As long as you succeed, you don't owe us anything.

Bernardo:
At that point, you're free to go.

Bernardo:
This, I promise you as the Fang of Zaaro, il Signore dei Lupi.

Texas:
......

Lappland:
Tsk, tsk. The sun's still getting in my eyes, even though it's raining.

Lappland:
Prison food's not too bad. You should give it a try.

Loyal Mafioso:
You're right about that. I've even given 'em a few suggestions before.

Loyal Mafioso:
Now get in the car.

Lappland:
Can I sit this one out?

Lappland:
Does killing a single Columbian really deserve so much fanfare?

Loyal Mafioso:
The Don says Cellinia's gonna be there too.

Lappland:
Oh?

Lappland:
What's the plan?

Loyal Mafioso:
She'll pretend to be an actress, and once the performance starts, you'll improvise the rest.

Lappland:
Hmm... So what about my costume?

Loyal Mafioso:
What the Don meant was—

Loyal Mafioso:
You wait in the audience and play along.

Lappland:
Oh, right. Haha.

Lappland:
What an insensitive old jerk. So where's he gonna be? He's not trying to find a nice place to watch the show all by himself, is he?

Loyal Mafioso:
The Don has other business. He's got a meeting.

Lappland:
A meeting?

Loyal Mafioso:
Yeah, with a carwash worker.

Croissant:
Howdy, Sora. I just knew you'd be practicin' in Miss Caterina's studio.

Croissant:
I ain't gonna stop ya, but don'tha think you oughta head to the theater early? To do some makeup n' get ready n' whatnot?

Sora:
Yeah, you have a point.

Croissant:
Exusiai's already off to buy breakfast. We got just enough time to meet her.

Sora:
Okay.

Croissant:
Say... Didn't we say we'd set up a big ol' welcome for Exusiai's sister?

Sora:
We did.

Sora:
But now I'm not sure we'll have enough time for that.

Sora:
Croissant, watch your step!

Croissant:
Huh? Wooooah!

Croissant:
Owwie...

Sora:
Are you alright?

Croissant:
I'm fine, I'm fine. Just tripped on a little somethin'.

Croissant:
Dangit, I knocked over that stack of books. Lemme tidy 'em up.

Croissant:
Huh? A picture dropped outta somethin'.

Sora:
Picture?

Croissant:
Wait... Huh?

Sora:
What's wrong?

Croissant:
Lookie here!

It is a photograph from many years ago.

Sora can barely make out the background that should be of the wide and bustling streets of Columbia past.

In the center of the photograph stands a middle-aged man who wears a kind expression, but exudes an audacity not to be trifled with.

On his left and right sides stand a Lupo girl, and a Feline girl.

The girl on the left has beautiful blonde hair and sports a cheery expression, and even at a glance, one can immediately tell that she has a bubbly personality.

The girl on the right has black hair, her face betraying no emotions, making it difficult for one to guess the contents of her heart.

Croissant:
Look, this pitcher... ain't that... Texas, as a kid?

Croissant:
And standin' there with her... That's Caterina?!

Croissant:
And look on the back here...

Written on the backside of the photo: 'Giovanna and Cellinia, 1080.'

Croissant:
Giovanna... Is that gonna be Caterina's real name?

Sora:
Giovanna... Giovanna Rossati.

Alberto:
How long has this carwash been open?

Carwash Worker:
Five years.

Alberto:
Five years? Coincidentally, that's how long my guard tuskbeast has been missing.

Alberto:
If only I knew how he was doing these days.

Carwash Worker:
The city's a pretty big place. There's always a way to survive.

Alberto:
It never made any sense to me before. I fed him plenty of meat, gave him a nice den. Why wasn't he happy?

Alberto:
Think he might've been vegetarian?

Carwash Worker:
Maybe. Maybe it never knew how bad meat actually was until it tried a full-course meal.

Carwash Worker:
It's better to not eat at all... than to eat something bad.

Alberto:
Oh?

Carwash Worker:
Your car's done.

Alberto:
You're pretty good at your job.

Carwash Worker:
Practice makes perfect.

Alberto:
Heh. You never fail to get it done just right.

Alberto:
But, Danbrown, nothing lasts forever.

Alberto:
It's time for you to change your tastes.

Carwash Worker:
...I'll think about it.

Alberto:
Think carefully. Once you've figured it out, you're always welcome to come back.

Makeup Artist:
Are you the backup bassist?

Texas:
Yes.

Makeup Artist:
Oh, um... Is that your natural hair color?

Texas:
Yes.

Makeup Artist:
That's special. Usually, you have to dye your hair to work as a bassist. I've heard only those with Famiglia Texas blood have that eye and hair color.

Makeup Artist:
And, now that I'm seeing you up close, your eyebrows... look really similar to Salvadore's. Are you his bastard or something?

Texas:
No, I have nothing to do with Texas.

Makeup Artist:
All sorts of coincidences out there, huh?

Makeup Artist:
Okay, take a seat over there. Your foundation's really good, so I should be able to get you squared away in no time.

Theater Box

Theater Manager:
Pardon me, are you satisfied with your seating?

Giovanna:
Yes, I've got a fine view.

Theater Manager:
Excellent, excellent.

Theater Manager:
If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to call for me.

Wallach:
Let's head down.

Giovanna:
You're not going to stay and watch?

Wallach:
You know I've never been a fan of this sort of stuff. How about I grab you a nice drink?

Giovanna:
I'd like—

Wallach:
Brandy, I know.

Sora:
Sorry I'm late!

Makeup Artist:
No worries. Everyone's still getting ready.

Makeup Artist:
Go ahead and take a seat. I'll do your makeup first.

Sora:
Okay.

Makeup Artist:
What's wrong? You don't look too well. Are you getting stage fright?

Sora:
No, I'm fine.

Makeup Artist:
Don't worry, Sora. You've been working so hard, everyone's gonna love you for sure!

Sora:
I hope so.

Makeup Artist:
Oh right, did you know...?

Sora:
What's wrong?

Makeup Artist:
Apparently, the bassist got sick and couldn't make it to the performance.

Sora:
Huh? What are you going to do then?

Makeup Artist:
It's no big deal. The director was able to find a stand-in. She's getting her makeup done in another dressing room right now.

Sora:
A stand-in... Are you sure that's going to work?

Makeup Artist:
Just trust the director's judgment, alright?

Sora:
Speaking of the director, he didn't come tonight?

Makeup Artist:
He just dropped by to give some direction before leaving again. I think he's meeting with a guest.

Makeup Artist:
Important people are always so busy, huh?

Makeup Artist:
But it's okay, Sora. You just need to play your part, that's all.

Sora:
Yes.

Lavinia:
......

Onsite Staff:
Oh, if it isn't Judge Lavinia!

Onsite Staff:
I haven't seen you here for a while. Have you come to watch tonight's opera?

Lavinia:
No, I'm just passing by.

Onsite Staff:
That's too bad. But, did you know we're putting on the highly-anticipated 'La Morte di Texas'? I'm sure you'll love it.

Lavinia:
Sorry, I'm not in the mood.

Onsite Staff:
That's alright then. I look forward to your next visit.

Lavinia:
...Huh?

Lavinia:
(Danbrown? What's HE doing here?)

Lavinia:
(Did he really... take my advice and come to the theater to unwind?)

Lavinia:
(But, today's performance is...)

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
Wait a second.

Onsite Staff:
Oh, did you change your mind?

Lavinia:
That's right.

Lavinia:
One ticket please.

Theater Box

Mafioso:
Don Bernardo, someone's here to see you.

Bernardo:
Oh?

Mafioso:
It's Rubio, Segretario di Sicurezza Alimentare.

Bernardo:
......

Bernardo:
Let him in.

Mafioso:
Of course.

Rubio:
Don Bernardo—

Bernardo:
You can just call me 'director' here.

Rubio:
Ah, yes, yes. It's an honor to be here, Director.

Bernardo:
Take a seat, Signor Segretario.

Bernardo:
Let's enjoy the show first, then we'll talk.

Announcer:
Signore e signori, thank you for being here tonight. You are about to see another spectacular performance brought to you by Compagnia dell'alba.

Announcer:
'La Morte di Texas,' Act II, written by Signorina Caterina.

Announcer:
Every Siracusan already knows the story of Salvadore, but how many truly know the details?

Announcer:
Signora Caterina, who has a deep understanding of Famiglia Texas, provides us with her frank yet intricate perspective.

Announcer:
Let us delve deeper into the life of Salvadore!

Sora:
(Inhales deeply, then exhales.)

Makeup Artist:
Break a leg, Sora!

Sora:
Right, time to go!

Exusiai:
Phew... Finally found them.

Exusiai:
Attagirl, Sora scored us seats with a great view.

Croissant:
Great expectations for her, all around.

Exusiai:
Excuse me, would you mind letting us through?

???:
A Sankta girl... An unusual sight in Siracusa.

Exusiai:
Ehh? You're a Sankta too?

Exusiai:
I've been in Volsinii for a while, and this is the first time I've seen one of my people.

???:
Hehe, looks like it's one good thing after another today.

???:
Go right on by, child.

Exusiai:
......

Croissant:
What's wrong?

Exusiai:
That's weird... I don't sense any emotions from him. Is he an exiled Sankta?

Exusiai:
But, he's unlike any of the other Sankta exiles I've seen...

Exusiai:
Well, whatever. By the way, am I the only one who thinks way too much of this crowd looks like mobsters?

Croissant:
I hear tell the head of the Rossati Family's here tonight.

Exusiai:
Hey, isn't that what you were just talking about?

Croissant:
Yep. But let's just enjoy the show for now.

Sora:
(Singing) In an era when chaos and opportunity came hand-in-hand; some were swallowed by the tides of the times where others found in it their promised land.

Sora:
(Singing) Violence and wealth, power and order.

Sora:
(Singing) Onto Columbian soil steps a Siracusan, bringing with him only scars, hardship, and ambition.

Sora:
(Signing) And thus begins our tale. Ladies and gentlemen, come and bear witness, to whom this era truly belongs.

Lappland:
That voice...

Lappland:
I see how it is. You're here to bring her back, aren't you?

Lappland:
But do you really think that's going to happen?

Rossati Mafioso:
Who the hell are you?

Lappland:
Signore e signori, let the show begin!

Giovanna:
It really is you, Cellinia.

Exusiai:
Huh...?

Croissant:
Texas?!

Sora:
—Ehh?

Texas:
...?!

For a brief moment, Texas shifts her eyes to one of the boxes.

She knows Bernardo is sitting there, gazing down upon everything.

She feels it in her heart.

Whether coincidence or some form of necessity, in this moment, Sora is both a danger and a safe haven.

Everything depends on her.

The movement in the auditorium and the faint sounds in the distance all prelude the start of the assassination.

She gestures to Sora for her to stay silent, then proceeds to pluck the strings in her hands.

A most wonderful performance has begun.
