Quartiere Saluzzo

Bernardo:
Leon.

Bernardo:
I've never been one to tell you what to do. I've always hoped you'd come to your own decisions about everything.

Bernardo:
You've done well, all these years.

Leontuzzo:
If you really think that, then why...

Why did you suddenly decide to act now?

Why are you telling me this?

Why... did you betray Lavinia?

Countless questions swirl around Leontuzzo's mind, but none of them leave his lips.

What he just saw and heard seems to contradict his cognition. He suddenly feels as if the man before him is not his father. He's like a stranger.

Bernardo:
Because this is the best, and only chance.

Leontuzzo:
What do you mean by that?

Bernardo:
You'll find out soon enough.

Rubio:
Signor Bernardo, Signor Leontuzzo, it's a pleasure to see you.

Bernardo:
Hmm? You're not one of Saluzzo's associates.

Leontuzzo:
Segretario di Sicurezza Alimentare, Rubio. Why are you...?

Rubio:
My dipartimento is catering tonight's banquet. I'll be cooking, personally.

Bernardo:
Oh?

Bernardo:
I've heard that in Volsinii, no event worth its salt can be held without the endorsement of il Dipartimento di Sicurezza Alimentare.

Rubio:
You speak too highly of me.

Rubio:
I'm just hoping to make food that satisfies the fine men and women of every famiglia.

Bernardo:
Yet another reason to look forward to tonight's banquet.

Lavinia:
You came.

Texas:
Where is he right now?

Lavinia:
He went to the Saluzzo mansion.

Texas:
Okay.

Lavinia:
You're not going to ask why?

Texas:
I can tell that Bernardo is very important to you.

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
When I became a judge, he didn't ask me to abuse my position to protect the famiglia backing me, like all the other judges.

Lavinia:
He let me do what I wanted to do.

Lavinia:
Leon, too.

Lavinia:
As the Bellone boss in this city, he respects my work and the brand of justice I seek to uphold.

Lavinia:
Even if I rule against the Bellones, he sees it as strictly business.

Lavinia:
In his words, my justice is more effective than blind violence.

Lavinia:
I don't object to his understanding of justice. He even spends some of his spare time reading law literature.

Lavinia:
Even so, as a judge, I still have to come face-to-face with the injustices that constantly plague this city.

Lavinia:
The power struggles between the famiglie, their oppression of the common folk, and the silent rage of the masses...

Lavinia:
The more I tried to uphold justice, the more difficult I realized my path was.

Lavinia:
I used to comfort myself that 'at least I'm not the tool of some famiglia.'

Lavinia:
But how could that be true? My hands are already dirty.

Lavinia:
I just didn't want to want to admit it. It's impossible not to get your hands dirty.

Lavinia:
Even if this seems silly to you...

Lavinia:
The promise Bernardo made to me was the only reason I was able to remain a judge in Siracusa.

Texas:
Promise?

Lavinia:
He once told me that after Famiglia Bellone emerged victorious, he would carve out a piece of land in Siracusa.

Lavinia:
There, the law I placed my faith in would no longer rely on pure power, where the justice I sought could truly be realized.

Lavinia:
He's hoped I could be patient until that day comes.

Lavinia:
Every time I start to think I can't bear it anymore, I think of his promise.

Lavinia:
Tell me, if all of this was a lie, then what purpose has my life had for the past ten years?

Texas:
I think... given his power and status, he wouldn't need to lie to you like that.

Lavinia:
Right? That's why—

Saluzzo Mafioso:
Who is it?

Saluzzo Mafioso:
Huh? You're—

Lavinia:
I am Judge Lavinia. I would like to speak with Don Alberto regarding the murder of Carracci.

Saluzzo Mafioso:
Your Honor... The Don is entertaining an honored guest right now and doesn't have time to...

Lavinia:
By honored guest, do you mean Bernardo Bellone?

Saluzzo Mafioso:
......

Lavinia:
Please inform the two dons that this matter is of great importance.

Lavinia:
I will not leave until I see them.

Rubio:
Please try this one. I learned it from a Leithanian chef.

Bernardo:
......

Bernardo:
Not bad, not bad.

Alberto:
Times have really changed, Bernardo.

Alberto:
In the old days, whenever we wanted something, it was all: 'I must have it, and I'll kill anyone who gets in my way.'

Alberto:
But now?

Alberto:
I need to find officials or businessmen who are on good terms with me, and ask them to get it for me. Be discreet about it too. Wouldn't want news to get out.

Alberto:
Ridiculous.

Alberto:
Isn't that right, Rubio?

Rubio:
Ah... Anything you desire, can be yours, Don Alberto. For one to be called upon to get what you want is his honor.

Alberto:
Hah.

Bernardo:
Segretario Rubio, you must've been plenty lucky yourself to fill that position.

Rubio:
I didn't have that kind of luck, which is why I had to go about it this way. I'm just a clown, currying favor with the bosses.

Alberto:
Heh. Look at this guy, always talking himself down. The fact that you're even here today is enough to prove your worth.

Rubio:
You're right, Don Alberto.

Alberto:
Alright, Bernardo. We've spent enough time exchanging pleasantries, so let's get down to business.

Alberto:
You want to do what the Dodici Famiglie have always wanted to do, but never had the guts—take <i>her</i> down.

Alberto:
And sure. You have my support.

Alberto:
But you've only just muddied the waters. If you really want to overthrow her, you're a long way away.

Alberto:
The fact that you even dared to come to this dinner shows that the cards are still in your hand.

Alberto:
So tell me, what exactly do you plan to do?

Bernardo:
......

Bernardo:
Alberto, what do you think about Famiglia Rossati?

Alberto:
Rossati?

Alberto:
They've got ambition.

Bernardo:
Famiglia Rossati isn't alive today just because Giovanna's standing up as Salvadore's successor.

Bernardo:
Someone must think the legacy of the Texas name—old Salvadore's knack for unification, was an invaluable asset.

Alberto:
If you ask me, it's a liability.

Alberto:
Charisma this, charisma that. In the end, money is what talks. It's the only thing that'll get anyone to give a damn about you.

Bernardo:
You're right. And also wrong.

Bernardo:
From where we stand, there are always methods of convincing people.

Bernardo:
And to be fair, I do somewhat admire Giovanna.

Bernardo:
While the Texas legacy <i>did</i> make for a liability, she took it up willingly, and managed to make it her own..

Bernardo:
It's true that the Rossatis have depended on the wealth and connections they've accumulated.

Bernardo:
But, they've gone too far.

Alberto:
In what way?

Bernardo:
Do you really think she wants to hand over the key to the new city to either of our famiglie?

Alberto:
......

Bernardo:
We've been jostling for power here, but the Rossatis haven't shown the slightest interest in participating, as if they're not even here in our world.

Bernardo:
But, they are the same Rossatis that took up Salvadore's legacy. They handed over the technology to build that city to Siracusa. Do you really think they're bystanders in all this?

Bernardo:
To a new city built to commemorate Salvadore?

Bernardo:
A new city that could change the trajectory of Siracusa?

Alberto:
You mind putting it in plain Siracusan for me?

Bernardo:
How could I possibly be more direct, Alberto?

Bernardo:
The Dodici Famiglie have been battling here in Volsinii. And to her, this is nothing more than a beast-fighting exhibition.

Loyal Mafioso:
Don Alberto... (*whispers*)

Alberto:
Hmm? Judge Lavinia, and Cellinia?

Alberto:
They want to see me and Bernardo?

Alberto:
What's the meaning of this, Bernardo?

Bernardo:
They're not with me.

Alberto:
Oh?

Alberto:
The Saluzzos have never been anything but hospitable to our guests.

Alberto:
But, to those who are not guests—

Bernardo:
You can deal with them according to the Saluzzo way.

Leontuzzo:
......

Alberto:
Haha, alright then. You heard the man?

Loyal Mafioso:
Yes, Don Alberto.

Alberto:
Bernardo, I know you enjoy chatting about plans, and the future.

Alberto:
But I like more practical topics, myself.

Bernardo:
Because you know those like the back of your hand.

Bernardo:
The people know the Saluzzos never place a bet lightly. But few remember that when a Saluzzo <i>does</i> place a bet, he doesn't let it go lightly either.

Alberto:
Heh.

Alberto:
Rubio, the rest is not meant for your ears.

Rubio:
I get it—

Bernardo:
Segretario Rubio, do you have any interest in opera?

Rubio:
Oh... I sometimes go, when I have the time.

Bernardo:
Perfect.

Bernardo:
Take this.

Rubio:
This is... a ticket to 'La Morte di Texas' Act II?

Bernardo:
Yes. If it sounds like something you'd be interested in, feel free to go check it out.

Alberto:
I told you, Bernardo. The time for pleasantries is over.

Bernardo:
I'd also like to invite all Saluzzos and their associates to enjoy the show together.

Alberto:
What are you talking about?

Loyal Mafioso:
It's time to go.

Loyal Mafioso:
This is a private party.

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
And what if I told you I <i>must</i> see the dons today?

Loyal Mafioso:
The Saluzzos have a particular way of showing hospitality to unwelcome guests.

Lavinia:
I'm sorry, Cellinia.

Texas:
This is what I'm here for, isn't it?

Loyal Mafioso:
You dare pull your sword on a Saluzzo? Cellinia, last of the Texases, are you outta your mind?

Texas:
Flip that one around.

To kill, not for the sake of killing, but for an honest and sincere hope—since her return to Siracusa, this is the fight that has felt the least empty to her.

That is what Texas thinks.

Bernardo:
My theater manager informed me that Famiglia Rossati has reserved a VIP box for tomorrow night's show.

Alberto:
Oh?

Alberto:
Haha, staging a hit in a theater? Is that how the esteemed artistic director of Compagnia dell'alba operates?

Bernardo:
It's just sprinkling the dressing of truth onto a play.

Alberto:
But, there is one thing I still have doubts about.

Alberto:
Giovanna has heavies from Columbia among her associates.

Alberto:
Especially her boss in this city, Wallach. I've heard rumors of his methods.

Alberto:
How are you sure we'll be able to bring her down together?

Radical Mafioso:
Don Alberto... (*whispers*)

Alberto:
Haha, sounds like fun.

Alberto:
Bernardo, the judge and that Texas... very much want to see us.

Alberto:
They've already wounded some of my soldiers.

Alberto:
They are both close friends of yours, Bellone. Care to explain?

Bernardo:
......

Bernardo:
The associates of Famiglia Saluzzo have always been known for their bloodlust and combativeness.

Bernardo:
Alberto, if the Rossatis came to attack your home...

Bernardo:
What do you think their chances would be?

Alberto:
Zilch. They wouldn't stand a chance.

Bernardo:
Cellinia will be the blade that runs through the heart of Famiglia Rossati.

Alberto:
Oh?

Bernardo:
Where Rossati soldiers can't go, Cellinia can.

Bernardo:
So, what are you worried about? Can the Rossatis stop her?

Texas:
I remember you.

Loyal Mafioso:
I thought you totally gave up on this place, like you never even lived here.

Texas:
My time with the Saluzzos wasn't so bad.

Loyal Mafioso:
Then, you gotta know what it is you're doing.

Texas:
I do.

Lavinia:
Texas, you...

Looking at the unconscious mafiosi strewn around her, Lavinia can't help but be briefly lost for words.

Even with all this, Texas was still holding back. She thought she had seen it all in her time dealing with the famiglie, but this is still beyond her comprehension.

Lavinia:
I'm glad I'm on your side.

Texas:
Unfortunately, it looks like this is as far as we'll get.

Lavinia:
Huh?

Lavinia:
Leon?!

Leontuzzo:
Lavinia... you shouldn't have come.

Lavinia:
I have to ask Bernardo something, face-to-face.

Leontuzzo:
The assassination of the boss of Famiglia Rossati has already been decided.

Leontuzzo:
Saluzzo and Bellone will join forces.

Lavinia:
That's the decision they made?

Leontuzzo:
It was our decision.

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
Where is he?

Leontuzzo:
Dinner just ended. My father is upstairs.

Leontuzzo:
You can see him, but nothing will change.

Along the way, Lavinia keeps running over a million different things to say.

There are too many questions she wants to ask Bernardo.

She imagines the countless arguments she'd have with him, as well as their outcomes.

She thinks she has mustered enough anger.

However, when she steps through the door, the scene she encounters shakes her to the core.

Bernardo sits upright in a luxurious chair.

In his hand rests a legal codex adorned with thorns.

The very same as the one she holds in her hands.

He lowers his head and rubs the tome lightly with his palms, as if completely unaware—of the thorns digging into his hands, of the bright blood trickling down.

Her chaotic thoughts all freeze in this moment.

In the end, thousands of words condense into one—

Lavinia:
Why?

Bernardo:
The game is over, Lavinia.

That sentence alone is already enough for her.

Only a few moments of silence pass, but she is already sapped of all her strength.

Lavinia turns to leave and does not look back, frightened of the tears about to roll from her eyes.

Bernardo remains in place, uttering not a single word as a few drops of his blood dye the floor.
