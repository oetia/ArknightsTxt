Bernardo:
The most unremarkable Dipartimento di Sicurezza Alimentare...

Bernardo:
And its popular but underappreciated segretario.

Rubio:
At this point, men like Carracci, who were propped up to maintain balance between the major famiglie, are no longer needed.

Rubio:
What you need is a puppet that is safe and useful.

Rubio:
Am I wrong?

Bernardo:
Signor Segretario, a truly safe and useful puppet would never refer to himself as such.

Rubio:
I just happen to be a bit more self-aware than others.

Bernardo:
Haha. And mightily self-aware you are.

Bernardo:
You're right, Rubio. You <i>are</i> the best candidate to replace Carracci.

Bernardo:
But, if you're willing to be so frank with me, I might as well share something with you.

Rubio:
I'm listening.

Bernardo:
My associates killed Carracci.

Rubio:
......

Bernardo:
You've got guts, and I like talking with men like you.

Bernardo:
So I'm willing to give you a chance.

Bernardo:
Turn around and leave this room, forget what you just said, and no harm will come to you.

Bernardo:
Then, go back home and spend some time with your wife and daughter. Savor the last moments of peace in this city.

Rubio:
Doesn't that mean you'd need a puppet like me all the more?

Bernardo:
Hm?

Rubio:
You're after this chaos. What's happening all around us.

Rubio:
You want to overturn the law laid down by Signora Sicilia. But you don't care if she rules, or if we go back to the old ways.

Rubio:
The conflict among famiglie never had anything to do with us commoners.

Rubio:
When something happens, we just wait to see the result.

Rubio:
It makes no difference to the commoners whether Signora Sicilia rules, or you do.

Rubio:
But, the winner will need someone to maintain the facade of order.

Rubio:
As the don of a famiglia, surely you understand this principle—

Rubio:
It isn't impossible for the commoners to survive without the famiglie, but the same cannot be said for the famiglie without the commoners.

Bernardo:
You're telling me that you hold the real power?

Rubio:
No. I'm making a self-serving justification for the weak.

Bernardo:
A good justification at that.

Bernardo:
But it doesn't tell me what you're really after.

Rubio:
Power, Don Bernardo.

Rubio:
Since I was a kid, everyone's looked down on me, because I'm weak. And I look like, you know, this.

Rubio:
The oppression I felt from the people around me was more real than anything the famiglie ever did.

Rubio:
I've suffered that my entire life, waiting for this chance.

Rubio:
You tell me you're one who had Carracci killed? All I can think is: thank goodness I came at the right time.

Rubio:
You may not want to hear this, but if you're going up against Signora Sicilia, it's probably not going to go your way.

Rubio:
But who cares? Doesn't matter to me if you win or lose, in the end—

Rubio:
But power is something Signora Sicilia can't give me. It's gotta be you.

Bernardo:
You're an honest man, Rubio. I like making friends with honest men.

Bernardo:
Hm?

Bellone Mafioso:
Don Bernardo... (*whispers*)

Bernardo:
......

Bernardo:
Give my order. Tell them, that's enough for today.

Bellone Mafioso:
Of course.

Sora:
What just happened?!

Croissant:
That room over there... started shaking?

Lappland:
Looks like she chose you.

Sora:
Huh?

Lappland:
That earthquake is Giovanna's Arts.

Lappland:
Sounds like they had a falling out.

Exusiai:
Look, Texas jumped out the window. Let's go after her!

Sora:
Right!

Lappland:
......

Lappland:
Ahh, Texas. If, and I mean if, we were friends back then... could I have kept you in Siracusa?

Lappland:
Hah, fat chance, right?

Lappland:
We would've just slaughtered each other.

Carwash Worker:
Lavinia, don't make me... kill you.

Carwash Worker:
I've got a job to do.

Lavinia:
......

Carwash Worker:
......

Carwash Worker:
Signorina Lavinia, I pray that you aren't born in Siracusa the next time around.

Rubio:
Just a second.

Carwash Worker:
Who are you?

Rubio:
You're one of Saluzzo's hitmen, right? This operation... is over.

Rubio:
Don Bernardo's orders, just in.

Lavinia:
......

Bernardo:
Lavinia, you shouldn't have shown your face here.

Lavinia:
That's not up to you.

Bernardo:
You've interfered with a Saluzzo operation. That's going to ruin the relationship between our two famiglie.

Lavinia:
Haha...

Lavinia:
So, why don't you go beg Alberto's forgiveness with my head on a silver platter?

Bernardo:
......

Rubio:
Wait, please. Signor Bernardo... I mean, Don...

Rubio:
I have a presumptuous request.

Bernardo:
Hm?

Rubio:
I imagine Signor Leontuzzo will be very busy in the future. It'll unrealistic to expect him to help me the way he did Carracci.

Rubio:
I'd like to ask you for a new assistant.

Rubio:
The judge here would be a suitable pick.

Bernardo:
That certainly is one option.

Lavinia:
What are you two talking about?

Rubio:
Ah, how impertinent of me, carrying on this conversation without including the subject, Signorina Lavinia.

Rubio:
Don Bernardo has decided that I, Rubio, the humble ex-Segretario di Sicurezza Alimentare, shall take Carracci's place as the next Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici.

Rubio:
And I have to admit, I'm not too experienced with bureaucratic affairs.

Rubio:
So I hope that you, as someone with ample experience, will become my assistant.

Texas:
......

Texas:
(I wonder how Sora and the others are doing...)

Texas:
?!

Texas:
What? Why... are you here?

???:
When you get old, you start looking for a place to enjoy the rest of your days.

Texas:
......

Rossati Mafioso:
Found her! She's right over there!

Rossati Mafioso:
Surround her!

Texas:
Looks like you insist on getting in my way.

???:
She's still worried about you, after what happened.

???:
As for me, I'm old now, so I spend my days taking care of the youth. It's a hobby.

???:
Stay a while and have a chat with your elder.

Texas:
Next time.

Texas:
Croissant?!

Exusiai:
Ohoh, let's have a look-see, who's off fighting all by herself?

Texas:
Why are you all here?

Exusiai:
As far as I can tell, the Siracusan families always fight together. It's your culture.

Exusiai:
And Penguin Logistics's culture iiiis—

Sora:
To party hard?

Texas:
In this case, it should be—

Texas:
Don't be afraid to rumble, right?

Exusiai:
You got it!

Exusiai:
Seriously though, old man. You think you could let this one slide, a favor from one Sankta to another?

Croissant:
Get'cher head on straight, Exusiai.

???:
......

???:
You do have a point.

???:
Ahh, the rainy season in Siracusa is a long one. It didn't bother me when I was young, but now, the arthritis is such a hassle.

???:
Children, striving for strength is fine, but remember to put your health and safety first.

Croissant:
Eh, yer pullin' my leg.

Exusiai:
Thanks a bunch!

Exusiai:
By the way, if I ever did want to talk with you, how could I find you?

???:
If you're searching for redemption, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you.

???:
But if you're searching for order, you will find me everywhere.

Texas:
That's enough. Let's get out of here.

Exusiai:
Woohoo!

Giovanna:
......

Wallach:
Donna.

Giovanna:
What's the situation?

Wallach:
The Bellones have retreated.

Giovanna:
Good work.

Wallach:
Where's Cellinia?

Giovanna:
Gone.

Wallach:
Gone?

Giovanna:
She couldn't kill me, and I couldn't kill her.

Wallach:
......

Giovanna:
Let's head back and prepare. The Bellones aren't going to let this go.

Wallach:
Right.

Wallach:
......

Wallach:
You've won, Leontuzzo.

Demetri:
Your original plan wasn't to win over Wallach, was it?

Leontuzzo:
But wasn't that the best option, given the circumstances?

Demetri:
Can't deny that. *cough* *cough*

Leontuzzo:
Alright, enough talk. Let's get you in the car.

Demetri:
Leon, you still haven't given up, have you?

Leontuzzo:
Compared to what Lavinia has been through, this setback is nothing.

Demetri:
You're going to do great things.

Demetri:
Maybe one day, you might actually be able to realize your dreams in Siracusa.

Leontuzzo:
And when that time comes, you'll be my right-hand man.

Demetri:
I don't get along with Lavinia.

Leontuzzo:
There are some things better left to her, and others better left for you.

Demetri:
Haha, you cheeky bastard. You're already thinking about that kind of stuff?

Leontuzzo:
Demetri... I'm still angry about what you and my father were plotting.

Leontuzzo:
I don't understand why he insists on continuing, even now.

Leontuzzo:
But, in the end, I'm still a part of this famiglia.

Exusiai:
Safe landing!

Sora:
*gasp*... *gasp*... It feels great to be back on our own turf.

Exusiai:
Phew... Siracusans sure are a pain in the ass. I'm totally wiped.

Exusiai:
You hanging in there, Sora?

Sora:
Yes. But my dress got a little torn up.

Exusiai:
Well, shoot. That one was awfully expensive, wasn't it?

Sora:
Ahaha, we'll figure something out.

Exusiai:
Alrighty, one bottle per person.

Texas:
......

Sora:
C'mon, knock it off with that stone face.

Sora:
Just think of it this way: the three of us also happened to be on vacation here.

Texas:
Then... what's with the show?

Sora:
Oh... That's, umm... just a way to grow my career~

Sora:
Plus, I thought it might make finding you a little easier.

Croissant:
I reckon it sure did, lookin' at the way things turned out.

Texas:
Sure enough.

The atmosphere remains chilly for a while.

But finally, an unavoidable problem emerges.

Where do they go from here?

Texas does not have it in her to ask.

Croissant:
Tex...

Sora:
Texas, I had an agreement with the director.

Croissant:
......

Texas:
Hm?

Sora:
Now that I've found you, I will stay here and complete my performance contract.

Texas:
But—

Sora:
I've spoken with the director a few times. It's a little scary, in retrospect, but I don't think he's the kind of man to hold our lives over you.

Exusiai:
You have a point. If he wanted to do something like that, he would've locked us up a long time ago.

Croissant:
Okay, alright, let's quit the jawin'. You keep talkin' and I keep gettin' scareder n' scareder.

Sora:
We really are here to see you. If it wasn't so dangerous out there, I'd like you to show us around.

Texas:
Okay... When we're through all this, I'll give you a tour.

Exusiai:
Anyways, let's celebrate this Penguin Logistics reunion in Siracusa!

All Four:
Cheers!

Croissant:
The biggest thing—

Sora:
Hm?

Sora:
An unknown number...

Sora:
I don't remember ever giving out this number...

Sora:
Hello? Who am I speaking with...?

Bernardo:
It seems you're safe and sound, Signorina Sora. That's a relief.

Sora:
You know what happened with Texas, right?

Bernardo:
Don't worry, Signorina.

Bernardo:
Your Penguin Logistics friends must be enjoying a joyous reunion.

Bernardo:
And I certainly don't want to interrupt that.

Bernardo:
But I was just thinking you might have a lot of questions for me.

Bernardo:
So, I'll be waiting for you at the theater tomorrow.

Sora:
Right.
