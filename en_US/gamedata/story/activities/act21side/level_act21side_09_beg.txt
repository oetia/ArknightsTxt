Leontuzzo forgot what happened that day.

He was still too young at the time.

He knows only two things for certain.

That day was not the day his mother died.

That day was the only time he ever saw his father look somewhat lost.

He walked through the rainy streets and saw his father sitting outside the church without an umbrella.

He tried to run over to hold up his umbrella for his father, but slipped and fell.

His father picked him up. The rain was heavier than usual that day. He could not clearly see his father's expression, but was still acutely aware of his father's chagrin.

He still remembers the question his father asked him at the time—

Would Siracusa be better off without the famiglie?

Demetri:
Leon, Leon!

Demetri:
Wake up!

Leontuzzo:
Unngh...

Leontuzzo:
Demetri...

Demetri:
Why are you lying on the ground here? Where's the Don? Were you attacked?

Leontuzzo:
No... Father, he...

Leontuzzo:
Right, my father! Where is he?!

Demetri:
Nobody knows where the Don is... And just now, Rubio broke the news about our alliance with the Saluzzos over the radio.

Demetri:
He also slandered us, accusing us of joining together against Signora Sicilia. Now, all the famiglie are looking right at us.

Would Siracusa be better off without the famiglie?

Leontuzzo:
That's not exactly slander, is it?

Demetri:
Leon?

Leontuzzo:
I know what my father wants to do.

Energetic Technician:
Who would've thought this Rubio guy...

Calm Technician:
Was actually a complete idiot.

Energetic Technician:
What are you talking about? He's clearly a good man!

Calm Technician:
No, what I mean is what's the point of him even saying stuff like that?

Calm Technician:
He finally managed to climb up to that position, and now he's gonna die over a few sentences.

Calm Technician:
What a waste of a perfectly good life.

Energetic Technician:
Are you crying?

Calm Technician:
No. I'm not.

Energetic Technician:
Want a tissue?

Calm Technician:
Thanks.

Energetic Technician:
Who are you? Employees only.

Bernardo:
I am the boss of Famiglia Bellone. But you can just call me Bernardo.

Energetic Technician:
Huh? The Don of Famiglia Bellone?!

Calm Technician:
Wh-What brings an honored Dodici don here?

Bernardo:
If memory serves me properly, this place is supposed to split off and become the secondary command tower of the new nomadic city's core.

Calm Technician:
That's right.

Bernardo:
Then, there's one thing I'd like to ask of you.

Energetic Technician:
Wh-What are you doing?

Bernardo:
Begin the separation sequence for the secondary core area.

Demetri:
...Impossible.

Leontuzzo:
But, that does explain everything.

Leontuzzo:
What my father told you, that we were planning to ignite an all-out war between all the famiglie to flush Signora Sicilia out, it was a feint.

Leontuzzo:
From the very beginning, Famiglia Bellone has just been a bargaining chip for him.

Leontuzzo:
Everything you see now was his design.

Leontuzzo:
Everything was for the sake of a Siracusa without famiglie.

Demetri:
You seriously expect me to believe that the don of the most powerful famiglia in the country... is trying to destroy all the famiglie?

Leontuzzo:
You have no choice but to believe, Demetri.

Leontuzzo:
You just said all the famiglie are looking at us, right?

Demetri:
Yes, but even if they believed Rubio, nobody would dare to do anything rash so soon.

Demetri:
But, it's just a matter of time.

Leontuzzo:
The fuse has already been lit...

Would Siracusa be better off without the famiglie?

Padre mio, this is what you've believed all this time.

That's why you had Demetri test me in the first place.

But, what do you want me to do?

What can I even do?

Demetri:
Leon.

Leontuzzo:
Huh?

Demetri:
You said before that you'd handle things your way, Leon.

Leontuzzo:
I did.

Demetri:
Then, you should focus up.

Demetri:
Whatever the situation, at this critical moment, the don is not here. You are now the boss of the famiglia.

Demetri:
We have to do something.

Leontuzzo:
I know.

Leontuzzo:
Go and tell the Saluzzos that I want to meet with Alberto.

Leontuzzo:
Then, get in touch with the Rossati man, Wallach.

Demetri:
You mean... I see.

Leontuzzo:
......

What is it I hope to do?

Bernardo:
By building goodwill through Carracci's legacy, you got the people to believe that you really chose to draw all the fire purely out of a desire to avenge him.

Bernardo:
It wasn't until the end that you finally revealed a sliver of your real face.

Bernardo:
Your self-control is admirable, Rubio.

Bernardo:
Unfortunately, I knew a long time ago that you and Carracci were on the same path.

Bernardo:
Neither of you were willing to accept the yoke of famiglie rule forever.

Bernardo:
Only, he stepped onto the stage like a moth to a flame, while you concealed yourself a bit better.

Bernardo:
After all, I was in charge of the liquidation thirty years ago. I remembered him, and naturally, I remembered you as well.

Bernardo:
It came as a surprise to me that you chose to make your move now, but that brings with it opportunity.

Bernardo:
Is the separation sequence still not complete?

Calm Technician:
It'll be done shortly.

Bernardo:
I hope you know that stalling for time and playing petty tricks won't accomplish anything.

Calm Technician:
The lives of all my colleagues are in your hands, I'm not kidding.

Calm Technician:
I don't want anything to do with the conflicts between your big famiglie. I just hope you keep your promise.

Bernardo:
You say that, but the look in your eyes and the beating of your heart tells me that you're ready to die with me.

Calm Technician:
......!

Bernardo:
Relax. I just want to ask you a question.

Bernardo:
Have you ever thought about what a Siracusa without famiglie would look like?

Danbrown stares blankly at the scene unfolding in front of his eyes.

He has slain many people and seen his fair share of corpses.

He became numb to the sight of blood a long time ago.

But this is something altogether different.

Saluzzo Mafioso:
Danbrown, why are you still here?

Saluzzo Mafioso:
The Don wants to meet the Bellone and Rossati bosses, so hurry up and do what you need to do!

Danbrown:
What is the Don doing?

Saluzzo Mafioso:
Are you deaf, Danbrown?

Saluzzo Mafioso:
The Don is about to meet the Bellones, and told us to prepare.

Danbrown:
Prepare what?

Saluzzo Mafioso:
You don't get it?

Saluzzo Mafioso:
The Don sincerely wanted to cooperate with the Bellones, and that broadcast just now was them trying to drag us underwater.

Saluzzo Mafioso:
How could the Don let that go unpunished?

Saluzzo Mafioso:
The Bellones were the first to sully our honor, so it's not our fault if we're a little discourteous with them.

Saluzzo Mafioso:
The Don's meaning is obvious. Follow his orders at the meeting. Famiglia Bellone is about to be wiped from Siracusa.

Danbrown:
......

Rubio:
Why are they chasing money and power instead of violence and conflict?

Rubio:
Is killing me today just a cathartic release of this violence?

Rubio:
Or is it because... I got in the way of the people behind you taking power?

Danbrown suddenly understands why he hasn't been able to sleep at night.

Texas knows why she has been hesitating.

She doesn't like to think, and that means when she encounters a situation in which she is forced to think, she plans everything to the letter in advance.

She anticipated this well before she ever set out on her trip to Siracusa.

She knew she would have to fight.

But, she believes that what she did in Lungmen was not fundamentally different from what she had done in Columbia or Siracusa.

She does not believe that her life in Lungmen is righteous, just as she does not believe that her life in Siracusa or Columbia was evil.

She has always dealt in the logistics of life and death.

She knew she would one day have to face the land of Siracusa.

But she had already made up her mind.

Just as she had once asked her grandfather this question:

'Isn't Siracusan morality just trampling on the lives of the people all the same?'

She even anticipated meeting up with old acquaintances like Giovanna.

She really did anticipate all of this.

And that's why she has been tossing and turning sleeplessly for several nights.

But the one thing she did not expect was that she would meet people here who wanted to change the place.

Leontuzzo—even though he is the heir to a famiglia, his way of thinking is progressive. His ideas may still be immature, but they are never violent.

Lavinia—a puppet of Signora Sicilia's will, but a judge who nevertheless wants the law to apply equally.

Carracci—even though she never met him, she learned from many sources that he served the people as Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici.

And finally—

She used to feel that there would never be an end to all this, that she was powerless to change Siracusa, that everything was too deeply entrenched.

So she chose to run.

However, after returning this time, she's met people who wanted to make this land a better place, and they were hurt, one after another.

Would she still choose to run?

Mafioso:
I found her! Cellinia's over here!

She has been hesitating because her desire to return to Lungmen is real.

But at the same time, her anger towards the plight of those people is just as real.

And right before her eyes, a good man with good intentions is forced by this country to cry out, at the cost of his life.

That is when Texas realizes—

Never in her life has she felt so outraged.

Exusiai:
Woah, what's with the crowd?

Exusiai:
Looks like some of them are starting to charge.

Exusiai:
Don't blame me for this, Texas. I've already done what I could.

Texas:
Why would I blame you?

Exusiai:
Heya, partner, you get a good rest?

Texas:
Good enough.

Exusiai:
You look pretty mad.

Texas:
So you can tell.

Exusiai:
Of course. Just like how you can guess what I wanna eat from my mood.

Exusiai:
We've been partners for so many years.

Texas:
Exusiai, a good man just died.

Exusiai:
I heard.

Texas:
There's something I want to do for him.

Exusiai:
I was thinking the same thing.

Lappland:
Do my ears deceive me, Texas?

Lappland:
You're planning on staying, aren't you?

Texas:
Lappland...

Texas:
Thank you for 'doing your best' to help me get back to Lungmen.

Texas:
But I've already made up my mind.

Texas:
There are a few people out there who don't deserve to die like that. They need help. They deserve it.

Lappland:
Can you actually do anything about that?

Lappland:
Is this little fairy tale enough to make you choose a different path?

Texas:
This little fairy tale is more than enough to make me choose a different path.

Texas:
Some things aren't that complicated at all, Lappland.

Texas:
You, on the other hand...

Texas:
How long are you going to stay on a leash?

Lappland:
......

Lappland:
What, are you lecturing me now?

Texas:
Take it as a little advice from someone's who been there.

Texas:
Exusiai, I'm going to break the encirclement. Back me up.

Exusiai:
You got it!

Lappland:
......

Lappland:
Texas, you're always full of surprises.

Lappland:
Aha... Haha, ahaha!

The sounds of footsteps and screams gradually dissipate with Texas and Exusiai's departure, and the alley falls silent again.

Only the hollow laughter of the lone white wolf continues to reverberate.

Until she too stops laughing.

She turns her gaze in a certain direction. Not the one Texas left, but rather where Famiglia Saluzzo resides.

Rubio's Daughter:
Father... He.... Urk....

Lavinia:
Feel any better?

Rubio's Daughter:
...Yes.

Rubio's Daughter:
Your Honor, why would my father do something like that?

Rubio's Daughter:
I wish he would've kept doing what he did before... If only he'd just kept on being an ordinary segretario...

Lavinia:
You might not understand this yet, but your father was a great man.

Lavinia:
I'll send people to keep you safe. Stay inside, and don't wander out. Alright?

Rubio's Daughter:
I-I can feel it... After what my father has done, the whole city is going to turn upside-down.

Rubio's Daughter:
You should hide here with me.

Lavinia:
Thank you, but I have work to do.

Lavinia walks out of the room.

The peal of that gunshot resounds through Volsinii. Even the dark clouds part for a few minutes as if spooked, letting a few strands of sunlight filter through, for the first time in ages.

Her agreement with Bernardo was once her only goal.

To the point that when she found out Bernardo had broken his promise, she didn't know what to do with herself.

But now, she knows.

Because she's been told she does not stand alone.

And the ones who told her made a sacrifice a hundred times more heroic than her struggles.

Compared to them, she might actually be the lucky one.

But she does not plan to stand by and rely on this luck.

Lavinia:
......

Lavinia:
Ministro Rubio, your sacrifice will not be in vain.

She strokes the codex in her hands, a few names from Rubio's diary still lingering in her head.

She has either seen them before, or heard of them.

This is the most bountiful legacy that Rubio has left behind for her.

Moreover—

Lavinia:
Who is it?

Texas:
Penguin Logistics. Need something delivered?

Leontuzzo:
Don Alberto.

Alberto:
I came because I heard Bellone wanted to speak with me.

Alberto:
What, does Bernardo not even dare to show his face?

Leontuzzo:
My father made his own decision.

Leontuzzo:
Just trust that I can speak on behalf of Famiglia Bellone.

Alberto:
Oh?

Alberto:
You mean to tell me that you have a satisfactory explanation for all this?

Alberto:
Or, are you confident enough to deal with the fallout?

Leontuzzo:
What I wanted to say is——

Alberto:
Danbrown, I didn't call for you to come out yet.

Danbrown:
No, the time is now, old man.

Danbrown points the weapon in his hand at Alberto.

Alberto:
Danbrown, I'm afraid you're pointing your knife at the wrong target.

Danbrown:
I don't make mistakes.

Danbrown:
Look what the famiglie bosses have become.

Danbrown:
You all sit high-and-mighty above the rest of us, talking all fancy about your politics, trends, country, and future.

Danbrown:
But what's the reality? The only thing you give a damn about is your own business.

Danbrown:
We took the times with violence, old man.

Danbrown:
Why not take a little pride in it?

Alberto:
The times have changed, Danbrown. Why don't you understand this?

Alberto:
We're shaping the times as we want.

Danbrown:
I don't understand it. I just see us turning weak and stupid.

Danbrown:
We don't take pride in our instincts, and we don't use peace to fight for peace.

Danbrown:
If we keep this up, what will we become?

Alberto:
We won't become anything.

Danbrown:
No, we're not a pack of wolves anymore.

Danbrown:
We're monsters hiding in human skin.

Danbrown:
And, our leaders.

Danbrown:
You.

Danbrown:
And you.

Danbrown:
You aren't more civilized. You're just more hypocritical.

Alberto:
......

Alberto:
Looks like I should've kept you on a tighter leash, Danbrown.

Alberto:
This isn't your podium.

Nobody could've caught what happens next.

In the blink of an eye, Alberto appears behind Danbrown.

A streak of blood appears across the carwash worker's throat.

He grips his neck, his eyes wide, unable to make a sound.

Then, he slowly slumps to the ground, maintaining this posture.

He will never speak again.

Leontuzzo:
......

Alberto:
Now that this matter is resolved, I won't beat around the bush, Leontuzzo.

Alberto:
Your father convinced me to agree to combine our famiglie's forces to take down Signora Sicilia.

Alberto:
But I don't see sincerity in anything you've done.

Alberto:
The people know that I, Don Alberto, never place a bet lightly. What they don't know is that once I do, I never stop until I win.

Alberto:
Leontuzzo.

Alberto:
Submit to Famiglia Saluzzo, or die, here and now.

Alberto:
You have ten seconds.

Alberto takes out an antiquated pocket watch from his waist and begins counting down Leontuzzo's fate.

Lavinia:
You've always got the option of violence, but you refrain from using it because of your upbringing and self-control. I'd even like to thank you for your kindness.

Leontuzzo:
That's not what I meant.

Lavinia:
And I'm not blaming you either, Leon.

Lavinia:
For you to even consider why the rain hasn't stopped is already exceptionally rare to see.

Bernardo:
You've subconsciously lumped yourself in with Lavinia and Carracci.

Bernardo:
But don't ever forget, you are not one of them.

Leontuzzo:
I know.

Bernardo:
If you really knew, you wouldn't be standing here.

Leontuzzo thought he understood what they were trying to say.

He could never truly be Lavinia's ally. He would always be his father's son.

This is the life he was born into, something he cannot change. And in spite of that, he's always believed he has done his best.

Is his best not good enough?

But—

Danbrown:
You aren't more civilized. You're just more hypocritical.

This is the moment when he finally awakens.

It isn't a question of good enough. He has been wrong from the very beginning.

We aren't more civilized. We're just more hypocritical.

We aren't more civilized. We're just more hypocritical!

Right. That's right.

Why is he sitting here?

Why did he still think he could resolve this like the famiglie do?

He knew the answer all along.

But he chose to ignore this answer for the longest time because of who he is and where he came from.

Everything he's done before was just violence wrapped up in pretense.

And civility... can never be born from violence.

Alberto:
You're running short on time, Leontuzzo.

Leontuzzo:
......

Leontuzzo:
I choose...

Alberto:
What just happened?!

Saluzzo Mafioso:
Boss! The secondary core area! Someone started the separation program!

Alberto:
What did you say?!

Leontuzzo:
......!

Leontuzzo:
So this is your last resort, father.

Leontuzzo:
Then, I'll——

Alberto:
Too naive.

Alberto:
......!

Wallach:
Hmph, you're pretty fast for your age.

Alberto:
A Rossati?

Demetri:
Leon, I'm here.

Demetri:
You go on ahead. I'll handle this.

Leontuzzo:
Alright.

Alberto:
I see, so this is Bellone's trump card...

Alberto:
But, are you sure you really want to make an enemy of me, Don Alberto, and of the Saluzzos?

Demetri:
You expect me to believe you were ever really going to be our friend?

Alberto:
Shared interest could've been the bond connecting us, pup.

Alberto:
But, there's something to your youthful delusions, thinking you can actually turn things upside-down.

Wallach:
You old fossils always think you can control everything, but you never stop to consider whether the times have left you behind.

Alberto:
Come then, pups. Let me try your hand.

Leontuzzo:
......

Leontuzzo knows that as the don of a famiglia, he should return home and navigate his people through these turbulent times to maximize their profit.

But as a man who thinks he understands Lavinia's ideals, a man who saw the way Carracci conducted himself, as a man who has always been lost...

He's never been clearer about what he should do next.

He can't lie to himself anymore.

Leontuzzo:
I'm sorry, Demetri.

He does not walk the path of his famiglia.

He knows where his father is.

Bernardo:
I did what I had to do.

Bernardo:
It won't be long before it reaches Zaaro.

Bernardo:
The time has come.

Bernardo:
Agnese's Fang, Lunacub.

Bernardo:
You've kept me waiting.

Lunacub:
You're never alone, and I'm not good at taking a lot of opponents at once.

Bernardo:
I don't make a wise target.

Lunacub:
Agnese told me that of the remaining Fangs, you are the one who most deserves to die.

Lunacub:
You've toyed around with the thing called 'power,' trying to use that garbage to win this.

Bernardo:
Quite the profound insight from la Signora dei Lupi.

Bernardo:
Do you know where the remaining Fangs are?

Lunacub:
No.

Bernardo:
One now lives at a company called Rhodes Island.

Bernardo:
She returned to Siracusa not too long ago.

Bernardo:
Another, knowing that there was no hope of victory, went into hiding and cultivated a student early.

Bernardo:
These two wandering wolves have now returned to Siracusa.

Bernardo:
Another is still hiding in the wastes.

Bernardo:
And as long as I remain here, I can track their movements.

Bernardo:
With a little more power, I could exercise my will to find them, and have my men eliminate them.

Bernardo:
This is what Zaaro discovered — the might of power.

Lunacub:
Does that count as victory?

Bernardo:
It's what he believes.

Lunacub:
How strange.

Bernardo:
The strange one is you, Fang of Agnese. You didn't come here to kill me, did you?

Lunacub:
I was just a little curious.

Lunacub:
You don't seem like an evil man, or one who wields power as you claimed.

Bernardo:
What do you see when you look at me, then?

Lunacub:
A beast who went looking for a place to die, now laying peacefully in it.

Terrified Waiter:
Are those wise guys gone yet?

Fearful Waiter:
They're gone, right?

Terrified Waiter:
Thank goodness, I thought they were going to start fighting.

Fearful Waiter:
But... what are we going to do with this body?

Terrified Waiter:
I... I don't want to touch it.

Fearful Waiter:
Still, I can't help but feel a bit bad for this guy.

Ben:
I'll handle it.

Fearful Waiter:
Wh-Who are you?

Ben:
Just a friend of this nameless man.

Ben:
You've discovered something important, my friend.

Ben:
Violence is done in the name of civility.

Ben:
That is the true nature of the famiglie.

Ben:
And we must come to terms—

Ben:
With what we call civility, even if it's another pretense, even if it's just a form of self-restraint...

Ben:
Even if it's only a stone's throw from our basest instincts...

Ben:
An earnest desire for civility will always be different from using it to whitewash your sins.

Ben:
Neither this country nor this city will remember you.

Ben:
But I will remember you, Danbrown, the carwash worker.

Ben:
Together with Rubio, the two of you have proven the lie that famiglie can change and adapt.
