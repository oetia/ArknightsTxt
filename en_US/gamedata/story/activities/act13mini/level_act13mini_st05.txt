Xiaohei:
Xiaobai!

Xiaobai:
Is it really you?

Xiaohei:
Yep! It's me!

Xiaobai:
I thought I'd never see you again...

Ah Gen:
We've been looking for you all this time.

Xiaohei:
Same here! Are you guys alright?

Ah Gen:
(Pats Xiaohei on the shoulder) Good as ever. Don't worry.

Xiaobai:
What about you, Xiaohei? Are you hurt? Have you been going hungry?

Xiaohei:
(Shakes head) No, I'm doing great! I've been eating good every day!

Xiaobai:
Haha, that's so great to hear!

Ah Gen:
I just never expected we'd reunite in a place like this.

Xiaobai:
Who cares? We did!

Xiaohei:
Mm-hm!

Xiaobai:
So you're working part-time for Mr. Lee now?

Xiaohei:
Yeah. He took me in, and I felt bad just freeloading there.

Xiaohei:
What about you guys? How have you been doing at that Rhodes Island place?

Ah Gen:
We haven't actually been to the landship yet. We're just here with their operators in the branch office for now.

Xiaohei:
And what's their branch office like?

Ah Gen:
A lot like the Hall for Spirits—their main thing is helping out some very unique people.

Ah Gen:
You might have seen them. The ones with rocks growing on them.

Xiaohei:
Ah. I know how... tough their lives are. Other people treat them so badly.

Ah Gen:
Yeah. It's why I admire Rhodes Island's operators.

Xiaohei:
I've been so worried about you guys coming here and catching it. Isn't it dangerous for you to stay there?

Ah Gen:
They have thorough protective measures at the branch office. And as for Xiaobai, I've been taking good care of her.

Xiaobai:
Don't worry, plenty of operators work there, and they don't get sick.

Xiaobai:
Like Rockrock!

Xiaobai:
She's been helping these sick people for forever, and she's always been fine.

Xiaohei:
(Glances at Rockrock)

Suzuran:
Rockrock, that little Feline's looking at you.

Rockrock:
He is?

Rockrock:
(Waves an arm at Xiaohei)

Xiaohei:
(Stiffens up) Agh!

Ah Gen:
Relax, they're good people.

Rockrock:
You must be Xiaohei. Xiaobai and Ah Gen told me about you.

Rockrock:
And you're just as adorable as I imagined.

Xiaohei:
N-Nice to meet you, Rockrock.

Rockrock:
Xiaohei, Xiaoyuan has a few things she'd like to tell you.

Rockrock:
Come on, don't be shy now.

Xiaoyuan:
Um, hello...

Xiaobai:
(Smile, Xiaohei! Xiaoyuan's really nervous to see you.)

Xiaohei:
Oh, okay.

Xiaohei:
Uh, hello, Xiaoyuan? What did you want to tell me...?

Xiaoyuan:
Um, thanks... thanks for helping me find Sixty-Seven.

Xiaohei:
No problem. If I weren't helping him, I wouldn't have found my friends either.

Xiaoyuan:
So you're all friends too! Today's such a great day. Everyone's finding everyone they missed.

Xiaoyuan:
Isn't that right, Sixty-Seven?

Storm Cloudbeast:
(Licks foot)

Storm Cloudbeast:
Wrraaw...

Xiaohei:
You named him Sixty-Seven?

Xiaoyuan:
Mm-hm, because he was sitting on sixty-seven LMD in a suitcase when we found him.

Xiaobai:
Did his original owner abandon him there?

Xiaoyuan:
Yeah. And that's not even enough for a bag of pet food.

Storm Cloudbeast:
(Lies down) Mreeh...

Xiaohei:
Sixty-Seven... I think heard that name somewhere recently...

Doc:
If memory serves, they had Oripathy. By the looks of it, they were on their last legs... Then they asked me to keep the little guy too.

Doc:
Come to think of it, I still remember them turning out their pockets to find every last bit of change...

Doc:
...I even remember how much they managed to scrape together...

Doc:
Sixty-seven. Sixty-seven LMD exact.

Xiaohei:
Xiaoyuan... did you ever go see a really strange-talking, but really good doctor?!

Xiaohei:
Did you ask him to take in this cloudbeast because you'd gotten sick?

Xiaoyuan:
No! Why would I do that?

Xiaoyuan:
He's my pet! Why would I give him to someone else?!

Xiaoyuan:
And anyway, there are all these really amazing doctors here! I'm not gonna go ask anyone else for help!

Xiaohei:
Well, if you're not the one...

Xiaohei:
Wait, then who was that?

Xiaohei:
(Stares at the storm cloudbeast)

Xiaohei:
Who else could be the one you're looking for?

Storm Cloudbeast:
(Droops its head)

Xiaoyuan:
Sixty-Seven... do you still miss somebody?

Storm Cloudbeast:
Mrew...

Rockrock:
Er, who are you lot talking about? Me and Suzuran are a little lost here.

Suzuran:
Who is this 'somebody'?

Xiaobai:
Ah...

Ah Gen:
What is it, Xiaobai?

Xiaobai:
......

Xiaobai:
I think I know who he's looking for.

Xiaobai:
I saw a photo here. The cloudbeast in it looked exactly the same as Sixty-Seven.

Rockrock:
When did you see it?

Xiaobai:
Just today. I was trying to find Suzuran, so I could ask her to hold a funeral for Sixty-Seven.

Xiaohei:
Funeral? But he's right here, isn't he?

Ah Gen:
Haha, it's complicated. We were helping Xiaoyuan look for him too, but in the end all we found was a collar with blood on it.

Xiaobai:
So we were going to hold a funeral because we thought he'd already passed away. We wanted to send him off properly.

Xiaohei:
Oh, I see. He was probably just hurt at that time.

Xiaoyuan:
(Picks up the storm cloudbeast)

Xiaoyuan:
Sixty-Seven, where did you get all these new cuts... wasn't the scar on your leg big enough?

Storm Cloudbeast:
(Licks Xiaoyuan's cheek)

Suzuran:
(Removes photograph from the wire)

Suzuran:
This photo's been hanging here for years. It's a good thing it was underneath all those other pictures, so it hasn't faded too much.

Rockrock:
Let me have a look... That's Sixty-Seven, no doubt about it. Xiaoyuan, here.

Xiaoyuan:
(Takes photograph)

Xiaoyuan:
Is this... the person you were looking for, Sixty-Seven?

Xiaoyuan:
Is that why you could never sit still, and were always looking out the window and running away?

Xiaoyuan:
Is it all because you were looking for him?

Storm Cloudbeast:
(Nuzzles photograph with forehead)

Xiaohei:
The weird doctor said there was someone with stone disease who took out all the money they had, and begged him to take care of their pet cloudbeast.

Xiaohei:
He was the one who told me to look here...

Xiaohei:
So when he was talking about what people had left behind, he meant these photos?

Xiaohei:
So who put this photo up?

Xiaohei:
And who'd come to visit it?

Rockrock:
Perhaps—they're already among the other photos, somewhere along here.

Xiaohei:
......

Xiaohei:
Xiaoyuan, was there anything else left in the suitcase, apart from the money?

Xiaoyuan:
No, nothing. If you're right, then that was probably everything he left behind.

Ah Gen:
Not everything. Didn't he leave you Sixty-Seven too?

Xiaoyuan:
That's not really leaving him to me...

Suzuran:
Hey, look at the back of this photo, Xiaoyuan.

Xiaoyuan:
Huh?!

Xiaoyuan:
(Turns photograph over)

Xiaobai:
What is it?

Xiaoyuan:
It's a poem...

Ah Gen:
What does it say?

Xiaoyuan:
It says...

Xiaoyuan:
Says...

Xiaobai:
(Tugs on Ah Gen's sleeve) Ah Gen...

Xiaoyuan:
(Kisses the storm cloudbeast's forehead)

Xiaoyuan:
Sixty-Seven... did you know?

Xiaoyuan:
You...

Xiaoyuan:
You weren't abandoned. You were the... best, best present ever, from the most generous person in Terra.

From the storm cloudbeast's throat rolls a gentle rumble, like a sigh, and like a call too.

It turns its head, and gently brushes against the photograph.

Nightfall's embers fall on its face, like a hand reaching out from the past to brush away the fog of time, sweep off the dust of what light remains, and softly touch its forehead.

It soothes all its accumulated worries, and wipes away all its lingering doubts.

Xiaobai:
Sixty-Seven still misses his old owner so much.

Xiaohei:
Even though he's already gone.

Ah Gen:
He might be, but he'll live forever in Sixty-Seven's memories.

Xiaobai:
Ah Gen, Xiaohei, will I always live in your memories too?

Ah Gen:
Haha, what are you talking about? It's still too soon to be asking that sort of thing.

Xiaobai:
Yeah, but... you'll live forever, and so will Xiaohei...

Xiaobai:
Xiaohei?

Xiaohei:
Huh?

Xiaobai:
If you go somewhere really far away one day, you have to give me a proper goodbye, okay?

Xiaohei:
Mm-hm!

Xiaobai:
We have to eat our favorite snacks together one more time!

Xiaohei:
Mm-hm!

Xiaobai:
We have to read a really good comic together one more time!

Xiaohei:
Sounds good.

Xiaobai:
And we have to hug one more time.

Xiaohei:
Sounds good.

Xiaobai:
Um... and... what else was there...?

Ah Gen:
We're together now. That's more important than anything.

Xiaobai:
(Pulls Ah Gen and Xiaohei's hands in)

Xiaobai:
Mm-hm!

Xiaohei:
Mm-hm.

It was a gloaming, it was a dayspring. It was deepest night, it was brightest noon.

The day's sunlight was brilliant, the day's rainclouds stretched forever. The clouds hung thick in the sky, the clouds hung as wisps in the sky.

My departing footsteps placed ever so lightly, so I would not rouse you.

I abandoned you, and you parted with me.

Unwilling, and unresigned.

Fate is a merciful one.

With a single finger, it turns time's needle back.

Click, pitter-patter.

Back the raindrops hid in the clouds, back the writing drew into the pen, back the leaves grew onto the trees, the forget-me-nots returning to their buds once more.

And little by little, I came back to your side.

My arriving footsteps placed every so lightly, without the heart to rouse you.

That day, I embraced you, and you met me.

Rockrock:
Xiaoyuan, the car's outside! Hurry up!

Xiaoyuan:
I'm coming, I'm coming! Wait for me!

Rockrock:
Got everything with you?

Xiaoyuan:
Yeah! It's all in my suitcase.

Rockrock:
How about you, Sixty-Seven? You got everything of yours?

Sixty-Seven:
Mrrreah!

Rockrock:
Then I think we're off!

Xiaobai:
Miss Rockrock, wait for us! We're going to Rhodes Island too!

Rockrock:
Xiaobai?!

Ah Gen:
Xiaobai, don't run so fast!

Rockrock:
Ah Gen! Weren't you lot going to stay in Lungmen?

Ah Gen:
Um, Mr. Lee gave Xiaohei a mission to send some things over to Rhodes Island.

Rockrock:
What things?

Xiaohei:
He told me it was confidential. All he said was to hand it to someone called the Doctor.

Xiaobai:
Doctor... That's such a funny name.

Rockrock:
Haha, it's not a name. It's just a title.

Xiaohei:
Do you know who it is?

Rockrock:
I do. Happens to be Rhodes Island's commander and one of its founders. Every operator I've ever met has nothing but respect.

Xiaohei:
Oh, I get it. It's your boss. You all listen to what they say.

Rockrock:
Haha! Not that simple, hardly.

Xiaohei:
Then what kind of person is the Doctor, exactly?

Rockrock:
Someone you'll all take a shine to, I know that. The instant you meet, you'll know.

Suzuran:
Rockrock, are you and Xiaoyuan ready to go yet? The driver's getting impatient.

Rockrock:
Xiaobai and the lot want to come with us too!

Xiaobai:
That's right!

Suzuran:
Really?

Suzuran:
...I was just thinking, what if I was so sad to leave you all that I started crying? This is perfect! We can all travel together now.

Rockrock:
Xiaoyuan, you good to go?

Xiaoyuan:
Mm-hm, and so's Sixty-Seven.

Sixty-Seven:
Mraow!

Rockrock:
Then we're off.

Ah Gen:
Wait, Xiaobai—you left a bag!

Xiaohei:
I'll take it.

Ah Gen:
Oh, thanks. Alright, that's everything. Let's go.

Ah Gen:
(Looks around)

Ah Gen:
Time... flies so fast.

Shelter Owner:
Yangni, is that the L.G.D.'s feed you're eating? You look like you love it. Is it that good?

Yangni:
Wrwwrr!

Shelter Owner:
Why don't I give it a try?

Yangni:
Wrr?

Shelter Owner:
Phleugh! Pteh, pteh. Guess that's a taste humans can't appreciate, after all.

Yangni:
Wraaw...

Shelter Owner:
Steamed buns for me, then.

Shelter Owner:
So what brings you back here?

Beckbeast Trainer:
You think I'd be here with you if I wasn't bringing Yangni his food?

Shelter Owner:
You think I'd want you here if you weren't bringing Yangni his food?

Beckbeast Trainer:
(Narrows eyes at the owner)

Beckbeast Trainer:
Yangni, I bought you some new food and toys. How's that? Want to come live at the L.G.D. for a few days?

Yangni:
Awrruf!

Shelter Owner:
Evil on legs, you.

Shelter Owner:
(Angrily tears giant bite of steamed bun)

Beckbeast Trainer:
Here. Take this.

Shelter Owner:
What... vegetables and eggs? Where'd you find the kindness in your heart to give me this stuff?

Beckbeast Trainer:
Heh, you just said it. I'm kind.

Shelter Owner:
Hah... thanks.

Waai Fu:
Aw, Xiaohei and the cloudbeast are gone. I miss them.

Hung:
So do I. And I'm worried the food I gave him won't last the whole trip.

Waai Fu:
You filled an entire bag...

Hung:
He's at that Feline growth spurt age, after all. He needs to eat a ton.

Waai Fu:
Eh, that's fair.

Waai Fu:
Hey, Hung. Let's get a pet too.

Hung:
Oh? What do you want?

Waai Fu:
A cloudbeast?

Hung:
Oooh, hmmm... That could work. Let's ask Aak once he's out.

Hung:
What's happening?!

Waai Fu:
*cough* *cough* What's this smell? People aren't meant to breathe this.

Hung:
*cough* *cough* Aak, what in the six syllables are you concocting?

Aak:
Uh, slight mistake in the lab.

Hung:
Slight?

Aak:
Haha, you got it, aaand I'm out bye.

Waai Fu:
Actually... let's not get a pet.

Hung:
Yeah. You're right. Let's not.
