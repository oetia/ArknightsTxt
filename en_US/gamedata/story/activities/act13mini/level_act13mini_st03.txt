L.G.D. Headquarters, Upper Factor St., Uptown Lungmen

Noon

The L.G.D. is a special place. Those who have no business here tend to stay away, while those whom the L.G.D. itself has business with wish they could. That said, there will always be those looking for trouble, with or without business.

L.G.D. Officer:
(Stands guard)

???:
Hey, Ah Sir, have you heard of the Haam Coeng Inn mafia warfare from twelve years ago?

L.G.D. Officer:
(Ignores him)

???:
Ah Sir, what about the Po Wah Street Robbery on one rainy night ten years ago?

L.G.D. Officer:
(Remains silent)

???:
Ah Sir, what about the dual murder seven years ago?

L.G.D. Officer:
Mister, I know nothing about any of those events you just mentioned, and I've never heard anyone else talk about them either. Please stop disturbing me while I'm on duty.

Ah Gen:
(Facepalms and sighs)

Ah Gen:
Ah, never mind.

Ah Gen:
Officer, I want to report a crime!

Ah Gen:
I just saw that man in front of you steal someone's bicycle at the plaza!

???:
What? Why would I do that?!

???:
That's slander, you prick!

L.G.D. Officer:
Now, now, sir, there's nothing to worry about.

L.G.D. Officer:
We'll know whether you did it or not just by checking the security footage. Now, please step inside. And you, buddy boy? I'll need you to come in for a written statement, too.

???:
Uh... Okay.

Ah Gen:
(Blinks) Alright, Officer.

Ah Gen:
(Everything's going according to plan, Rockrock.)

Rockrock:
(Understood. Rock-27, activating stealth mode.)

The day before...

Ah Gen:
If I'm not mistaken, this should be the place.

Ah Gen:
Hello, is this the animal rescue shelter?

Ah Gen:
Hello?

???:
Scram, I'm busy here!

Ah Gen:
I'm just here to ask something, not to start trouble.

???:
You think I don't know how you little brats think?

???:
You get yourselves all excited to adopt a pet, then the moment you get bored with it the next day, you abandon it out on the street.

Ah Gen:
Sir, I'm afraid you're mistaken. I'm here not to adopt. I'm just here to ask about a missing storm cloudbeast.

???:
And I told you to scram!

???:
So you don't keep a close eye on your pet, and now that you've screwed up, you come crying to me.

???:
Scram! I'm not here to wipe you irresponsible punks' asses.

???:
You need your ass wiped, wipe it yourself!

???:
Get out!

Ah Gen:
Can't you at least let me explain?!

???:
Get out of my sight!

Ah Gen:
Hey! Open up! Just listen to me!

Ah Gen:
What the heck's with his temper?

Neighbor:
Stop knocking, kid. He won't open that door.

Neighbor:
That's just how he is. Grumpy.

Ah Gen:
Hello, Miss. Um... Do you know him?

Neighbor:
I live next door. I can count on one hand the number of times I've talked to him this year, though. He's got a bad temper, and a pretty sketchy past, too. He used to be in the Siracusan mafia. You'd be out of your mind to get involved with him.

Ah Gen:
Doesn't he run an animal rescue shelter? He can't be that bad.

Neighbor:
I know you're a kid, but you shouldn't just believe everything people tell you. When he keeps his front door closed all day long, who's to say what he's really up to inside?

Neighbor:
You can't trust anyone outside your family, much less someone who just slammed a door in your face.

Ah Gen:
So did you see anything to make you so suspicious of him, Miss?

Neighbor:
The L.G.D. paid him a visit a couple of days ago.

Ah Gen:
The L.G... D.?

Neighbor:
You're not from around here, are you? The cops, basically. They said he was illegally keeping police beckbeasts.

Ah Gen:
Police animals...? Isn't that... illegal?

Neighbor:
That's what I said. And if he's not afraid of keeping L.G.D. beckbeasts in his house, is he afraid of anything?

Ah Gen:
Then why does he keep all these rescues...?

Neighbor:
Sure, I see him bring back animals sometimes, but he just as often takes them somewhere else. Maybe... he's been selling them to black market butchers or something.

Ah Gen:
(That does sound sketchy... If he's actually doing shady business with an animal shelter as a front, I can't let it slide.)

Ah Gen:
Okay, I get it now. Thanks, Miss.

Neighbor:
Well, I'm heading back inside then. And you should go on home. Don't hang around too much.

After the woman closes her door, Ah Gen doesn't leave but instead walks up to the shelter door and touches the doorknob with his finger. A small icicle enters the keyhole, and after a little back and forth movement, it lets out a light click.

He pushes the door open just a crack and quietly slips in through the narrow gap.

Ah Gen:
No cages, no fences. Only a small feeding bowl with days old water and food.

Ah Gen:
What about the rescues? Where did they go?

Ah Gen:
(Did he really send them all to the butchers like his neighbor said?)

Ah Gen:
But if that's the case, why would there be all this pet food...?

Ah Gen:
What's this on the table...? An architectural diagram?

Ah Gen:
Lungmen... Guard... Department... Headquarters... Hm? There are a few spots marked in red.

Ah Gen:
Detention cell, beckbeast kennels... Only a door separates the two, very close to each other...

Ah Gen:
(What is this guy plotting? Is he doing all this just for that beckbeast?)

Shelter Owner:
Hey, punk, who the hell are you? How'd you get in here?!

Shelter Owner:
What the hell? I swear I locked the door.

Shelter Owner:
How did it break? Urgh... And why is it so cold?!

Shelter Owner:
(Turns to stare at Ah Gen)

Ah Gen:
My bad, sir.

Shelter Owner:
Was it you?! You better pay for this! I just got it replaced last week!

Ah Gen:
Huh?!

Shelter Owner:
What do you mean, 'Huh?'

Ah Gen:
(Frowns) Uh... Sorry?

Ah Gen:
Right, mind if I ask what you're planning with this blueprint?

Ah Gen:
(Picks up the diagram on the table)

Shelter Owner:
Hey, punk, stop touching my stuff! I'm going to kill—!

Ah Gen:
Careful.

Shelter Owner:
Mm... that's—

Ah Gen:
Don't move, sir, or this ring of ice around your neck is only going to get tighter.

Shelter Owner:
Not bad, kid.

Ah Gen:
So, would you mind telling me what you're planning to do at the L.G.D. Headquarters?

Shelter Owner:
Those shameless bastards... They made up some kind of excuse to take my beckbeast away! What, you don't think I should be trying to get him back?

Ah Gen:
Oh, but I heard it was you who took the cops' animal in the first place.

Shelter Owner:
Pfft, the poor thing had one paw in the grave when I found it! Where were the L.G.D. then?

Shelter Owner:
We've been getting along just fine for years. What gives them the right to come take him away NOW?!

Ah Gen:
So, you're saying you rescued it and kept it around...? But what about the other rescues? How come I don't see any sign of them here?

Shelter Owner:
Take a look around. Does this place look like a safe place to keep animals? I bought a patch of land that used to be an abandoned factory. They're over there.

Ah Gen:
You think I buy that?

Ah Gen:
What?!

Ah Gen:
A microwave oven?!

Shelter Owner:
What are you looking at?! I was just heating up a mantou!

Ah Gen:
That's your dinner?

Shelter Owner:
You sure ask a whole lot of questions, kid.

Ah Gen:
That's all you're having for dinner?

Shelter Owner:
What's that got anything to do with you?!

Ah Gen:
You have all this pet food around, but all you're having for dinner is a single mantou?

Shelter Owner:
I've got so many mouths to feed, I gotta cut costs somewhere!

Ah Gen:
......

Ah Gen:
Pardon me.

Ah Gen:
(Lowers his casting hand)

Shelter Owner:
*cough*—

Shelter Owner:
(Nervously strokes his neck)

Shelter Owner:
Kid... You know Originium Arts, don't you?

Ah Gen:
Haha, let's just say I do.

Shelter Owner:
Those lockpicking Arts of yours... Can you use them elsewhere?

Shelter Owner:
You were asking about a storm cloudbeast, weren't you?

Ah Gen:
Yeah, he's been missing for a year now. Have you seen him, sir?

Shelter Owner:
To tell the truth, I've saved a few of them, but my memory isn't all that great. I don't remember the details, but I do keep files on all of them.

Shelter Owner:
So if you're willing to lend me a hand, I'll take a look for you.

Ah Gen:
Uh, all you have to do is flip through some files, but you want me to break into the L.G.D. with you. In what universe is that a fair deal?

Shelter Owner:
Hmph, suit yourself. I'm not forcing you.

Shelter Owner:
But I guess you'll just have to ask somewhere else about your cloudbeast.

Ah Gen:
......

Rhodes Island Lungmen Branch Office

Early morning

Rockrock:
Ah Gen!

Ah Gen:
Huh? Morning, Rockrock.

Rockrock:
You look terrible. Did I spook you?

Ah Gen:
Haha, I've been mulling over some stuff. Didn't even notice you.

Rockrock:
Where were you this morning? Xiaobai came back pretty early last night and said you went to the slums by yourself. How was it? Find anything?

Ah Gen:
Rockrock...

Rockrock:
What's up?

Ah Gen:
I think I might've dug myself a huge hole I can't climb out of.

Rockrock:
So... did you say yes?

Ah Gen:
I guess? As far as we can tell there's no way we can get the beckbeast out, but I can at least help him get in.

Rockrock:
Then why is he going?

Ah Gen:
He said he's worried sick and has to see for himself, and that if his beckbeast isn't happy in there, he'll break it out of the building or die trying.

Rockrock:
Is he crazy?! If he wants to take that risk, he can do it himself. Why do you have to go with him?

Ah Gen:
I don't have a choice if we're going to find that cloudbeast. I've asked everyone else. He's the only one that pays any attention to the strays around here.

Rockrock:
And he wants to involve a kid? No, I won't let you. Who knows what that guy'll do?

Ah Gen:
Rockrock, you guys have enough on your plate already. I can handle this much myself.

Ah Gen:
And if push comes to shove, I'll just throw him under the bus. I'm pretty sure the L.G.D. will trust me more than a former mafioso.

Rockrock:
And what part of that is supposed to ease my nerves? Just give me a chance to help. I can make time to come with you.

Ah Gen:
But I heard from the operators here that you guys work closely with the L.G.D. I'm a complete outsider though. Even if something goes wrong, you've got plausible deniability, so don't bother helping me.

Rockrock:
You think that's what I'm worried about?!

Ah Gen:
Calm down, okay?

Rockrock:
Well... You're right. I can't be so reckless.

Ah Gen:
Right, so please just calm down and—

Rockrock:
But I CAN send one of my drones.

Ah Gen:
...Wouldn't that give your identity away anyway?!

Rockrock:
Closure gave me an all new optic refraction module that can make them temporarily invisible to the human eye.

Ah Gen:
You sound pretty excited...

Rockrock:
I can even adjust the propellers' rotation and reduce its noise to a minimum. When it's in super silent mode, nobody will notice it in even the quietest room.

Ah Gen:
Um, so you keep all those tools on you...? Wait, are you really going to tear it apart here and now?

Rockrock:
Shh, sit down. Don't go anywhere.

Rockrock:
Just you wait, I'll be finished in no time, and this drone will definitely come in handy. The moment you set foot in that building, it'll find out where everyone is and which way you should go.

Rockrock:
It can even disrupt surveillance cameras and hide your tracks. Besides, if that guy really bothers you so much, I don't want to give him the upper hand.

Ah Gen:
Well... Thanks?

L.G.D. Headquarters, Upper Factor St., Uptown Lungmen

Morning

Ah Gen:
Uh, I thought you said you were going to get us some water? Why did you get a pack of chips too?

Shelter Owner:
Eat up.

Ah Gen:
It's for me?

Shelter Owner:
Who else? I don't eat this crap.

Ah Gen:
...Thanks.

Shelter Owner:
Now eat. We'll start as soon as you're done.

Ah Gen:
You told me you knew how to get past the front door. Mind telling me what your plan is now?

Shelter Owner:
What, you can't figure it out on your own?

Ah Gen:
You really were part of the mafia, huh?

Shelter Owner:
Don't look the part?

Ah Gen:
No, you look exactly the part... So why did you leave and start an animal rescue?

Shelter Owner:
I was on the wrong side of a power struggle within the family. The boss kicked me out, and when I was down on my luck, I met Yangni. I saved him, and he saved me.

Shelter Owner:
That was when I figured out that there are things out there that needed me.

Ah Gen:
You two were close?

Shelter Owner:
Of course. He was trembling when I first took him in, but these days, he's more scared without me around.

Ah Gen:
What a story. A mafioso becoming best buddies with a police beckbeast.

Shelter Owner:
FORMER mafioso!

Shelter Owner:
Hmph, when I first came to Lungmen, never thought I'd be sitting on the L.G.D.'s front doorstep with a kid while he scarfs down potato chips either.

Ah Gen:
Want any? I can't finish all this.

Shelter Owner:
Give me one.

Shelter Owner:
Time can leave the nastiest scars...

Ah Gen:
......

Shelter Owner:
I must've lost it. Why am I even talking to a punk like you about all this? Not like you'd understand.

Ah Gen:
That's all the chips. Okay, sir, let's go.

Shelter Owner:
Alright.

L.G.D. Detention Cell, Upper Factor St., Uptown Lungmen

Afternoon

Shelter Owner:
You serious? Jacking a bicycle?

Ah Gen:
What's wrong with that? At the very least, we made it into the building.

Shelter Owner:
I thought you were writing a statement. How'd you get here?

Ah Gen:
I pulled a trick while I was writing it, and snuck out when the officer went to check things out.

Shelter Owner:
Did you follow the route I drew to avoid all the cameras?

Ah Gen:
Don't worry, I have a much safer way. You could even say I was completely invisible to the cameras on my way here.

Ah Gen:
Oh right, remember what I told you? Don't put your hand on the doorknob. You could get frostbite.

Shelter Owner:
Yeah, I got it. Now hurry up!

Shelter Owner:
The beckbeast kennels aren't too far from here. If we're quick, we can get back to the detention cell before they're back.

Ah Gen:
We're only going for a quick look, right?

Shelter Owner:
Shut up, I know that. Now hurry.

Ah Gen:
I see it. It's right over there.

Shelter Owner:
Yangni!

Yangni:
(Runs in circle excitedly) Wrr. Wrrwwrr.

Shelter Owner:
Yangni, let me look at you. Did you miss me when I was gone? I've been thinking about you every day.

Yangni:
Wrwwrrwr—

Shelter Owner:
Okay, okay. I'm happy to see you doing so well here. Look at this room. It's bigger than my bedroom! Hahaha.

Yangni:
Wrwwrr?

Shelter Owner:
I was thinking I'd bring you home no matter what, but look at you. They're taking such good care of you that you've gotten fat.

Shelter Owner:
Sorry you had to suffer with me for so long.

Yangni:
(Squeezes nose into a gap in the fencing to try to get out)

Shelter Owner:
Heh, you're so fat now, you can't even squeeze through the fence.

Yangni:
Wrwwrrwrwwrr...

Shelter Owner:
I know you miss me, but there's nothing we can do.

???:
Ah Gen, it's time to go. The drone's detected a cop heading this way from the other side.

Shelter Owner:
Who's talking?

Ah Gen:
...An invisible drone.

Shelter Owner:
Why'd you bring something like that?!

Ah Gen:
I'll explain later, but we've got to go, now. Someone's coming.

Shelter Owner:
Give me a little more time. Let me talk to him just a little more!

Rock-27:
Shut up and get going! I don't care if you're caught or not, but if you think I'll let you take Ah Gen down with you, you've got another think coming!

Shelter Owner:
What's wrong with you, trying to give me a scare?!

Rock-27:
Get going if you don't want to be caught! Do you really wanna get thrown in jail?

Shelter Owner:
If anyone finds us, it's gonna be 'cause of how loud you are!

Shelter Owner:
Yangni, I need to go now. We... We probably won't see each other again. You be good here. Eat well. Don't think about me anymore.

Yangni:
Wrrrr! Aoww!

Yangni:
(Keeps slamming the fence with its nose)

Yangni:
*Whine*...

Shelter Owner:
(Wipes tears) Yangni, stop it!

Ah Gen:
Rockrock...

Rock-27:
Hm?

Ah Gen:
Why don't you send your drone away first? I'll stay here and buy him some time.

Rock-27:
What are you planning? What if you get caught?

Ah Gen:
Don't worry. I won't bring you guys any trouble.

Ah Gen:
(Rips shirt)

Rock-27:
What are you doing?

Ah Gen:
Masking up.

Rock-27:
You sure you need to with me around?

Ah Gen:
(Opens mouth)

Rock-27:
Stop being so courteous with me, or I'm leaving right now.

Ah Gen:
(Closes mouth)

Rock-27:
Hey, we'll buy you ten minutes. If you have anything to say to your beckbeast, you better get on with it!

Shelter Owner:
Why are you two going so far to help me?

Rock-27:
Because I know that there are some things you'll never get a chance say again if you don't get it off your chest now.

Rock-27:
Let's go.

Ah Gen:
Yeah.

???:
It's gotten colder here...

???:
The wall's freezing up...? Shit, it's Originium Arts!

???:
Requesting backup—

Before he is able to reach the comms button on his helmet, a rigid chunk of ice locks the L.G.D. officer's arms in place.

Seeing that he can't break free, he grits his teeth and tries to dash toward the wall, but before his feet even leave the ground, he feels a chill climb his legs. He looks down to find ice reaching all the way up to his waist.

Ah Gen:
Sorry, Officer, I'm not trying to hurt you. I just want to borrow something.

Ah Gen:
First, I want to borrow this place. Next, I also want to borrow a few minutes.

???:
You aren't even showing your face. Shouldn't you be showing your sincerity when asking a favor?

Ah Gen:
Haha, sorry about that.

???:
And when you're borrowing something, you might want to explain what you need it for.

Ah Gen:
Would you believe me if I told you someone's catching up with an old friend?

???:
If they have any catching up to do, take it to a cafe. Why do it in a beckbeast enclosure?

???:
*exhales*...

???:
You bastards, you're here to see Meituan, aren't you?! You sure got balls. Show yourself!

Ah Gen:
Crap... Shouldn't have said that!

Rock-27:
(I didn't expect this guy to be such a quick thinker... What do we do, Ah Gen?)

Ah Gen:
(It's okay. That ice isn't going to melt any time soon. And once we're gone, there'll be no evidence left.)

Rock-27:
(Hurry, then. There'll be more of them here in just a moment.)

???:
Get out here! Stop sneaking around!

???:
So Meituan's been staying with a spineless man like you all those years, huh?!

Shelter Owner:
You asshole—

Ah Gen:
(Crap, this guy really can't take an insult.)

Shelter Owner:
Let him go, kid. I'm not leaving today without beating the shit out of this guy.

???:
And you got a kid to do your dirty work for you?!

Ah Gen:
Um... Officer, you have the wrong idea.

Rock-27:
(Ah Gen, I think we should probably stay quiet in front of him.)

Shelter Owner:
Let him go, punk!

Ah Gen:
But...

Shelter Owner:
Let him go!

Ah Gen:
(Uh... this is bad...)

Ah Gen:
Sorry about this, Officer.

Shelter Owner:
Asshole!

Beckbeast Trainer:
This is the L.G.D. HQ. You must really have brass ones to sneak in here to see Meituan.

Shelter Owner:
He's not Meituan! He's Yangni, and he's my pet!

Beckbeast Trainer:
You're wrong. His name is Meituan, and he's a beckbeast with first class honors. During the Chernobog Incident, he conducted countless search and rescue, bomb defusal, and tracking missions. There's no way you're his owner!

Shelter Owner:
The hell are you on about? If not me, then who? You? Does he look like he thinks of you as his owner?

Beckbeast Trainer:
Alright, I'll tell you! Meituan's owner is the L.G.D. Senior Superintendent Tse Ming! I won't let ex-con scum like you fool around with his former partner!

Shelter Owner:
Like I give a musbeast's ass about his 'former' partner!

Beckbeast Trainer:
Stop resisting!

Shelter Owner:
Take your goddamn hands off me!

Beckbeast Trainer:
You let go of my leg first.

Shelter Owner:
Why don't you take your arm off my neck first?!

Ah Gen:
Do you think they're fighting?

Rock-27:
No, more like bickering.

Rock-27:
They aren't going to hurt themselves, are they? Rolling on the ground like that?

Ah Gen:
No, the only thing that's hurting here is the definition of the word 'fight.'

*Thump*—*Thump*—

Ah Gen turns around to find the beckbeast naively slamming into the fence. It seems to be very agitated by the sight of the two men tussling with each other and is trying to break itself free from the cage.

It slams into the cage harder and harder each time, bloodying its soft nose.

Ah Gen:
...And maybe this impatient little beckbeast.

Rock-27:
I think our first order of business is to stop it, rather than our tussling hooligans.

Ah Gen:
Hey, little fella, do you want out?

Yangni:
(Rubs Ah Gen's hand)

Ah Gen:
You want the two of them to stop fighting, right?

Ah Gen:
Don't worry. Neither of them are any good at it. They won't hurt each other.

Yangni:
Ao...?

Ah Gen:
Though we really can't let them keep this up...

Ah Gen:
(Kneels and puts hand on the door handle)

Ah Gen:
You've decided who to go with long ago, right?

Yangni:
Wrwwrr!

Ah Gen:
It's just that they never asked you.

Ah Gen:
Well, now's the time to tell them.

Ah Gen:
Go.

Yangni:
(Wags tail)

Before the cage's door is even fully open, Yangni has squeezed itself out and started yelping at the tussling shelter owner and trainer.

Seeing that the two aren't paying it any attention, Yangni desperately bites the trainer's ankle. The pain immediately stops him, and he turns to look at the barking beckbeast.

Beckbeast Trainer:
Meituan, what's this about...?

Shelter Owner:
Yangni...

Ah Gen:
Can you two stop already?

Beckbeast Trainer:
Ah, you're finally showing yourself, boy.

Beckbeast Trainer:
You're still a kid. Don't believe whatever lies he's feeding you. Go home. This isn't your fault. This is between us, so you stay out of it.

Shelter Owner:
That's right, scram already. Go look up those files you want at the abandoned factory at No. 4, 9th Street, Downtown. I knew this was gonna happen, I had one of my lackeys show you the way.

Ah Gen:
You know, I can totally separate you two by force if it comes down to it.

Beckbeast Trainer:
Hey, what are you doing, kid?!

Shelter Owner:
Yeah, what's with those icicles?!

Beckbeast Trainer:
...We let go on the count of three.

Shelter Owner:
Fine. 1, 2, 3.

Shelter Owner & Beckbeast Trainer:
Phew—

Shelter Owner:
*Cough*... How come everyone's trying to strangle me these days?

Ah Gen:
Haha... What a coincidence.

Beckbeast Trainer:
Heh... I thought you were mafia. How the hell'd you survive till now with moves like that?

Shelter Owner:
You're in the L.G.D., and you've got the nerve to say that to me?

Beckbeast Trainer:
I used to work a desk job.

Shelter Owner:
We... have desk jobs in the mafia too.

Beckbeast Trainer:
(Rolls eyes)

Ah Gen:
Mind standing a little further apart? Give me some room.

Shelter Owner:
Do you have to squeeze between us?

Beckbeast Trainer:
(Scoots over reluctantly) *Sigh*...

Yangni:
Wrwwrr!

Shelter Owner:
Hehe, you want to sit next to me too.

Beckbeast Trainer:
You really want to follow him, Meituan?

Beckbeast Trainer:
What's so good about that guy? He kept you in that dingy place and fed you cheap pet food.

Shelter Owner:
...I can't offer him nearly as much as you guys can, but I... I've been feeding him and keeping him warm the best I can.

Shelter Owner:
All these years, if I was only 70% full, Yangni got to be 80%. If I was only 70% warm, he got to be 80%.

Shelter Owner:
I can't offer him the best of the best, just better than myself.

Beckbeast Trainer:
When Ah Ming was still around, he'd start taking care of Meituan before sunrise. He spared no expense and gave him the finest the markets had to offer.

Beckbeast Trainer:
Do you remember him, Meituan?

Yangni:
Aoww...

Beckbeast Trainer:
He loved you, and always did absolutely everything he could for you, ever since you were still a pup.

Beckbeast Trainer:
When Chernobog came crashing, he took you on that mission... And you went missing, and he gave his life. We couldn't even recover his full remains.

Beckbeast Trainer:
You haven't forgotten him just because he's gone, have you?

Shelter Owner:
Was this in Waang Saan Plaza?

Beckbeast Trainer:
That's right...

Beckbeast Trainer:
I'll always remember that place.

Shelter Owner:
He remembers, too. Every now and then, he drags me to the place I found him, only to howl.

Beckbeast Trainer:
Is that so? If he remembers him so well, then how is he able to keep facing forward?

Yangni:
*Whine*...

Shelter Owner:
(Strokes the nose wound of the beckbeast in his arms)

Shelter Owner:
Kid, why are you being all quiet...?

Ah Gen:
I'm just tired.

Beckbeast Trainer:
...You're really not a cute one, are you?

Beckbeast Trainer:
So you're Yangni now, Meituan?

Yangni:
Aoww...

Beckbeast Trainer:
You like him, don't you? Go with him, then. I won't keep you.

Shelter Owner:
What's this about?

Beckbeast Trainer:
I'm tired. Some burdens are too heavy to carry for so many years.

Shelter Owner:
You're just going to give up?

Beckbeast Trainer:
Listen. If he's made up his mind to go with you, then I'm behind him all the way.

Beckbeast Trainer:
I'll keep visiting that stinking hole in the wall of yours. And if I ever find you neglecting him, I'll show you what for.

Shelter Owner:
What a load of shit. Me? Neglect him?!

Beckbeast Trainer:
Shut up. I need to make a call.

Shelter Owner:
(Stop him!)

Ah Gen:
Shh—

Beckbeast Trainer:
Fu-zai, head to the third floor and get me some documents, will you?

Beckbeast Trainer:
Ah Tung, the air conditioning in the beckbeast kennels seems to be acting up. Could you send in a request to get it repaired for me?

......

Rock-27:
(Ah Gen, my surveillance shows that everyone who was heading this way is turning around.)

Ah Gen:
Let's get out of here, then.

Shelter Owner:
Yangni, let's go. We're going home!

Shelter Owner:
Hey, why are you going back inside the cage?

Beckbeast Trainer:
Meituan...? Are you...

Beckbeast Trainer:
Are you staying?

Beckbeast Trainer:
*Sigh*...

Beckbeast Trainer:
Look at you, you chowhound. Never gonna change, huh?

Yangni lifts its round, circular rear off the ground and shakes it a little. Then, it picks up a bag of pet food with its mouth and leaves the cage, shaking its rear as it trots to the shelter owner.

L.G.D. Headquarters Front Door

Beckbeast Trainer:
This is as far as I can take you.

Shelter Owner:
Good man... There are way too many turns inside this building, though. My head's still spinning.

Beckbeast Trainer:
I only took you down that route to dodge my coworkers. Be grateful.

Shelter Owner:
Haha, thanks, Ah Sir.

Beckbeast Trainer:
Hmph, I didn't do it for you.

Beckbeast Trainer:
See you, Meituan... No, Yangni.

Shelter Owner:
Be sure to come see him when you have time.

Beckbeast Trainer:
(Lets out a long sigh)

Beckbeast Trainer:
Ah Ming, don't worry... I'll go check on him often.

4 9th Street, Downtown

Shelter Owner:
Come in. I've got files on every animal I took care of.

Ah Gen:
That's a lot... It's piled up to the ceiling.

Shelter Owner:
A storm cloudbeast... Let's see. I specifically remember sorting these into categories.

Shelter Owner:
(Rummages through files)

Ah Gen:
Watch out, sir!

Shelter Owner:
There we go. Fetch.

Ah Gen:
You got it.

Shelter Owner:
It's all in here. Let's see... Records from last year.

Shelter Owner:
I had a total of four storm cloudbeasts here over that time...

Shelter Owner:
Is it this one? An old woman nearby adopted it not long after I found it. It's not far from here.

Ah Gen:
No, that one's got a damaged ear. The one I'm looking for doesn't.

Shelter Owner:
This one, then? No, its owner came to get him back...

Ah Gen:
The age isn't right either. That one's muzzle is turning gray.

Shelter Owner:
Eh, it's got be this one then. It's got to be. Look. Exactly the same.

Ah Gen:
You mean other than the big brown spot on its chest?

Shelter Owner:
Eh, sorry. My eyes aren't what they used to be.

Shelter Owner:
Eh, what was that? Where did it go? I can't see anything under the table.

Ah Gen:
Just keep reading. I'll climb down to take a look.

Shelter Owner:
Alright. Storm cloudbeast. Completely black coat. Unhurt. Escaped through the window on the morning of July 28. In the end...

Ah Gen:
Keep reading. I think I found it. It's a collar with a nameplate.

Shelter Owner:
...All that was found was a snapped collar... and a large amount of blood on the ground. Judging from the amount of blood, it was... unlikely to have... survived.

Ah Gen:
......

Ah Gen:
(Holds the collar up to examine under the light)

Shelter Owner:
Is anything written on the nameplate?

Ah Gen:
It says...

Shelter Owner:
Says what?

Ah Gen:
Sixty-Seven...
