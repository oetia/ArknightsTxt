Xiaobai:
Good morning, Min-Min.

Medic Operator:
Oh hi, Xiaobai. You look like you're—

Intercom:
On-duty physicians, please report to Ward 11. This morning, the patient's Blood Originium-Crystal Density spiked sharply and the Originium on the intercostal surface started to grow, causing severe pain. We have assessed this to be an acute exacerbation.

Medic Operator:
Prepare emergency medication and facilities. I'll be there shortly.

Xiaobai:
Min-Min, is there anything I can—

Medic Operator:
Let's talk about this after I get back.

Xiaobai:
Um, o-okay.

Rockrock:
Morning, Xiaobai. Did you have breakfast yet?

Xiaobai:
Hello, Rockrock. I went to the cafeteria early this morning.

Logistics Operator:
Do you have a moment, Rockrock? The sewage treatment system in the office seems to be malfunctioning. Do you think you could go take a look?

Rockrock:
You're in luck, I happen to have my tools on me today. Mind showing the way?

Xiaobai:
I think I–

Rockrock:
I'll see you this afternoon, Xiaobai.

Xiaobai:
*sigh*... Everyone seems so busy right now.

Suzuran:
Good morning, Xiaobai!

Xiaobai:
Oh hi, Suzuran. Did you have any plans today?

Suzuran:
Um, a few patients passed away over the last few days, leaving their prized possessions behind. I'm taking them out as a way of sending them off, so hopefully their souls will be able to rest in peace.

Xiaobai:
Does that... happen often in your line of work?

Suzuran:
Mm. Even though the medics try their best to rescue them, some tragedies are inevitable.

Xiaobai:
Can I help out with the funeral? I'd like to do something for them too.

Suzuran:
Funeral? Oh, no, it's nothing as fancy as that. It's just a small ritual.

Suzuran:
So it's okay, I can handle it myself.

Suzuran:
Just you being here is enough. A bunch of operators have told me that the patients have been smiling a lot more since you came.

Xiaobai:
Haha, really?

Suzuran:
Mhm. Oripathy treatment is a long and boring process. The time they've spent chatting with you really means a lot to them.

Xiaobai:
I'm so glad to hear that. I just wish I could be more useful in other ways.

Suzuran:
For us, the fact that you can talk to the patients without any fear in your eyes is already something we're really grateful for. You're doing great.

Xiaobai:
But isn't that like literally the least you could do? The more you say stuff like that, the more I feel like I haven't done anything special.

Suzuran:
Oh no, it's getting late. I really need to get going.

Xiaobai:
Then I won't keep you any longer!

Suzuran:
See you later then!

Xiaobai:
Bye!

Xiaobai:
(*pouts*) Ugh, another day where I can't help anyone out...

Xiaobai:
And that cousin of mine... He clearly agreed that we'd go help Xiaoyuan find her storm cloudbeast together, but he ended up leaving to go search for clues without me.

Xiaobai:
...I was the one who tried to help, but I only ended up holding him back.

Xiaobai:
Just like when we were out in the barrens. There wasn't a single thing I could help out with. I only made him more worried.

Xiaobai:
There has to be something else I can do, right? I can't rely on him forever.

Ah Gen:
What's eating you up, Xiaobai?

Xiaobai:
Oh, when did you get back? Did you learn anything about the cloudbeast?

Ah Gen:
I did, but it's not good news. It's... gone.

Xiaobai:
How could this be... Does Xiaoyuan know?

Ah Gen:
Mhm. I just came back from her ward.

Xiaobai:
She must be so sad right now... What should we do?

Ah Gen:
That's up to you.

Xiaobai:
Me? What can I do?

Ah Gen:
I'm sure she needs your company right now. Go cheer her up, alright?

Xiaobai:
Is just being there... enough to cheer her up?

Ah Gen:
If anyone can do it, it's you. I'm sure of it.

Xiaobai:
Okay! I'll stay with her and help her get through this!

Xiaoyuan:
Sixty-Seven... *sob*...

Xiaobai:
Can I come in, Xiaoyuan? I brought you some candy.

Xiaoyuan:
(Quickly wipes tears away)

Xiaoyuan:
Oh, come in, the door's unlocked.

Xiaobai:
Let's play a little game. Can you guess which hand the candy is in?

Xiaoyuan:
I don't know...

Xiaobai:
Come on, just take a guess.

Xiaoyuan:
Your right hand?

Xiaobai:
Haha, you got it! Congrats on winning the strawberry candy. As a reward, I'll also give you the peach candy in my other hand.

Xiaoyuan:
Pff.

Xiaobai:
Mind if I sit next to you?

Xiaoyuan:
Mm...

Xiaobai:
I just saw Ah Gen coming back from here.

Xiaobai:
Are you doing alright, Xiaoyuan?

Xiaoyuan:
I... I'm really grateful to him, but... I'm going to need some time.

Xiaobai:
(Holds on to Xiaoyuan's hand)

Xiaobai:
Mm. I'm always here for you. If you ever need someone to talk to, just come to me!

Xiaoyuan:
Thank you.

Xiaobai:
(Massages Xiaoyuan's fingers)

Xiaoyuan:
Ah Gen... brought back a collar. It was the one that I gave to Sixty-Seven.

Xiaoyuan:
The top part... was soaked in blood. I can't imagine what he went through. He must've been in so much pain.

Xiaobai:
(Tightly squeezes Xiaoyuan's hand)

Xiaoyuan:
*sigh*... It's okay, you don't have to worry about me. I made a promise to Rockrock that I wouldn't lose to grief.

Xiaobai:
I think you're doing fine.

Xiaobai:
So... are you going to go with her to the Rhodes Island landship next week?

Xiaoyuan:
Mmhmm. I've already packed my bags—they're under the bed. Without Sixty-Seven, there's nothing left for me here. I'm ready to leave.

Xiaobai:
Xiaoyuan...

Xiaobai:
Say, why don't we hold a funeral for him?

Xiaoyuan:
A funeral?!

Xiaobai:
Yeah. Let's hold a small funeral before you leave, so you get a chance to say goodbye.

Xiaoyuan:
Stop joking around. Only rich people can afford funerals. Folks like us don't even dare dream of it.

Xiaobai:
Why's that?

Xiaoyuan:
So many Infected die here without getting funerals.

Xiaobai:
...Even if you don't want to dream of it, I will!

Xiaoyuan:
Huh...?

Xiaobai:
It's not healthy not to say goodbye to those who leave us. Just leave Sixty-Seven's funeral to me!

Xiaobai:
Excuse me, sir, is this the Fair Departures Funeral Parlor?

Funeral Parlor Staff:
How'd the receptionist let a little kid in? Someone, get them out of here!

Xiaobai:
Wait, I'm not playing around! I'm here to organize a funeral!

Funeral Parlor Staff:
So, do you want to buy funeral supplies, or would you like a team to organize it for you?

Xiaobai:
I, I'd like a team!

Funeral Parlor Staff:
So, who will we be conducting this funeral for?

Xiaobai:
My friend's pet.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Ahahaha! This has to be some kind of prank, right? Only people with more money than common sense would host a funeral for a pet in Lungmen.

Xiaobai:
Why are you laughing? What's so funny about that?!

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Ah, to be young and idealistic again.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
I'll just tell you straight up: since our establishment, our company has had countless clients here, all wealthier than you can imagine. Among them, some have even been qualified to be buried in the cemetery in the middle of the city.

Xiaobai:
What, so you're too good for us ordinary folks?

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Young lady, when someone's loved one passes away in Lungmen, they usually purchase their wreaths and candles from us. Even a spontaneous gathering in the square counts as a funeral.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
So asking a professional team to host one for your little pet is more than a little extravagant.

Xiaobai:
Extravagant? Is it that expensive?

Xiaobai:
I guess I'll pass then... I don't have much money. But if you have anything here that I can use for it, I'll just take some of that.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Everything here is for people, though... Honestly, we don't carry a single thing for pets. What kind of creature are we talking about anyway? I'll see if I can pick out something usable for you.

Xiaobai:
It's a storm cloudbeast. Here's a picture.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
(Huh? Why does it look so familiar... Wait, isn't this Lady Yuan's cloudbeast?)

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Young lady, do you mind if I ask for your friend's name?

Xiaobai:
I call her Xiaoyuan.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
(As in 'Little Yuan'? Is she really on a nickname basis with Lady Yuan? Could this girl be one of her friends?)

Funeral Parlor Staff:
(The Yuan family did make a phone call a few days ago to inquire about possible funerary services for a lost cloudbeast.)

Funeral Parlor Staff:
(Could she be here on their behalf?)

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Ahem... So, uh, was Miss Yuan's cloudbeast never found in the end?

Xiaobai:
That's right. Xiaoyuan asked a bunch of people to look for it. Finally, my cousin found its collar soaked in blood, so we assume it's dead.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
(Ahh, Lady Yuan hired so many people, enough to turn Lungmen inside-out, yet still couldn't find it. What awful luck.)

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Pardon me for prying, but how has Miss Yuan been doing lately?

Xiaobai:
She's trying to be strong, but I can feel her sadness.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
(Tch... The boss has always wanted to curry favor with the Yuans, so I can't just ignore this girl...)

Funeral Parlor Staff:
(I should've realized sooner. What kind of child from an ordinary family would even consider a funeral for a pet?)

Funeral Parlor Staff:
I'm so sorry to hear that, young lady. Don't worry, we will handle the funeral. I'm sure Miss Yuan will be most satisfied with the results.

Xiaobai:
But, didn't you just say it was too extravagant to hold one for a pet?

Funeral Parlor Staff:
There's no need to dwell too much on what I just said, young lady. We would be honored to carry her thoughts and feelings, and share her pain.

Xiaobai:
Oh, so does that mean...?

Funeral Parlor Staff:
We shall fully cover the expenses. After the procession is over, I only hope that Miss Yuan can put in a good word for us with the boss.

Xiaobai:
If you're willing to help, Xiaoyuan will definitely sing your praises when she sees it.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
That would be a great honor, haha. May I ask for your family name?

Xiaobai:
Luo.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Miss Luo, Miss Yuan is lucky to have a friend like you.

Xiaobai:
(*blushes*) Ahaha, I wouldn't go that far...

Funeral Parlor Staff:
This way, please. Allow me to introduce you to some of our establishment's award-winning services.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
The first plan we offer is exquisite papercrafts. The works you see here were all painstakingly handmade by masters from Shangshu.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Encompassing all aspects of the life of the deceased, we also offer packages for different ages, genders, and personalities.

Xiaobai:
There are even game consoles and handhelds here... Do you think you'll have anything suitable for a pet?

Funeral Parlor Staff:
We can make a custom set for the cloudbeast, including paper nests, bowls, and climbing towers, as well as paper food tins and freeze-dried goods.

Xiaobai:
...You really do have everything here, huh.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Please take a look at our second plan—a procession of flowers.

Xiaobai:
Wow, the colors in this wreath are so vivid... My eyes feel like they're going to bloom.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
That's right. This wreath is made up of a comprehensive arrangement of flowers corresponding to the five elements and eight trigrams.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
When used in a funeral, it blesses the family, the clan, and their descendants, making it the best choice for funeral accessories.

Xiaobai:
Um, it's a pretty small animal, so I don't think such a big wreath would make sense.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
We'll make a smaller replica and send it over. Upon it will be written an elegiac couplet by the famous Lungmen calligrapher, Hsieh Te-hao.

Xiaobai:
Thanks for doing all of this.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Last, but not least, is our trump-card service, ever a customer favorite.

Staff Member Clad in Black:
Father! Oh, dear father! May you forever rest in peace!

Xiaobai:
(Freezes up in shock)

Xiaobai:
What in the world is this?!

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Hey, stop rehearsing here. Can't you see you're scaring our client?

Xiaobai:
Oh, it's okay, I'll be fine...

Funeral Parlor Staff:
This is our ambience team, dedicated to creating a sense of grief at the proceedings, to give the guests a more immersive mourning experience.

Xiaobai:
So, um... What kind of atmosphere are we supposed to have for a pet funeral?

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Quick, give this young lady a demo. The cloudbeast version.

Staff Member Clad in Black:
(Carefully puts on a cloudbeast-ear headband)

Staff Member Clad in Black:
Mreeeeeoowwwwwww, mrreeeooooowwwww!

Xiaobai:
I... I've learned something new today.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Are you sure this address is correct, Miss Luo?

Xiaobai:
Yes, we've already been over this a few times.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
You're absolutely sure that Miss Yuan lives here?

Xiaobai:
Yup, this is the place.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Very well then. I shall arrange for your supplies to arrive at this address. Once again, you're absolutely sure you don't need our staff to preside over the funeral? They are all eminent monks with rich experience.

Xiaobai:
Thanks, but we already have someone in mind.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
May I ask who that might be?

Xiaobai:
She's one of our friends from Higashi. She grew up in a shrine, so she's familiar with all kinds of rituals.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Ah, so it's a friend of Miss Yuan's. Do forgive me for my ignorance.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
(I see, so it's become popular among the upper crust to invite foreign spiritualists to recite the scriptures. We should add that to our list of services.)

Funeral Parlor Staff:
That being the case, I won't hold you any longer. There's still more work to be done, of course, but if you ever need our help, please don't hesitate to drop by.

Xiaobai:
Thank you for your time.

Xiaobai:
Xiaoyuan, why are you standing outside? You can come in.

Xiaoyuan:
Who was that?

Xiaobai:
Just a kind-hearted person. I was just planning to buy a few things and arrange them myself, but after I showed him the photo of Sixty-Seven, he suddenly offered to help us!

Xiaoyuan:
There's so much stuff on the ground here... It must've been expensive. How much did you pay for all this?

Xiaobai:
Nothing, actually. The nice man said they'd cover all the expenses. He even asked how you were doing.

Xiaoyuan:
Wow, that's not something you see every day. I didn't think there'd be anyone willing to help people like us.

Xiaobai:
So what do you think? They managed to get all this out in a single day.

Xiaoyuan:
They look wonderful, just like the real deal. Even when Sixty-Seven was still here... he never got to use such nice things.

Xiaoyuan:
If I'd known, I'd have come earlier to thank the man properly.

Xiaoyuan:
I'd better thank you too, Xiaobai. Without you here, I never would've dared to try something like this.

Xiaobai:
I should be thanking you.

Xiaobai:
Everyone's been so busy ever since I arrived, and I haven't been able to help out at all.

Xiaobai:
I can't treat people, I don't know Arts, and I can't fix anything. All I can do is watch the patients suffer, grieve, and even... depart.

Xiaobai:
So, I'm really happy I could do something for you. And, thank you for believing in me.

Xiaoyuan:
(*shakes head*) You've been great.

Xiaobai:
But let's not dwell on that! The funeral's about to start!

Xiaobai:
Oh, but Suzuran isn't back yet. I wanted to ask her to host it.

Xiaoyuan:
She should already be back from today's ritual.

Xiaobai:
I'll go look for her then. Wait for me right here!

Xiaoyuan:
(Tilts her head, watching Xiaobai disappear into the distance)

Xiaoyuan:
If only I could be like Xiaobai... So honest and brave.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Bro, you won't believe who I just got as a client. Yeah, I couldn't believe it either—the Yuan family's eldest daughter.

Xiaobai:
(Wait, that gentleman hasn't left yet?)

Xiaobai:
(Should I go say hi? He's on the phone though, and looks kind of busy.)

Xiaobai:
(Well, maybe I'll wait a little bit.)

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Miss Yuan called the boss a while ago. Do you remember that?

Funeral Parlor Staff:
She said she lost her storm cloudbeast last month, and if she couldn't find it, she'd call us to ask for a funeral. Well, today, her friend found it.

Xiaobai:
(Wait, didn't Xiaoyuan's pet go missing more than a year ago?)

Funeral Parlor Staff:
But, the address her friend gave me seemed a bit off. She asked me to deliver the items to a pharmaceutical company called Rhodes Island, not the Yuan estate.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
But that isn't outside the realm of possibility. The Yuan family's been producing cosmetics for years, so it wouldn't surprise me if they branched out to medicine too.

Xiaobai:
(The Yuan family? But, Yuan is her first name, not a family name... And what cosmetics? I've never seen any operators making cosmetics.)

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Well, let's not worry about it. Anything that helps me climb the corporate ladder and rub shoulders with the Yuan family is a good thing.

Xiaobai:
(None of this sounds like Xiaoyuan at all!)

Xiaobai:
(Wait, was there some sort of misunderstanding?)

Xiaobai:
I'm not sure what's going on, but I should find Suzuran first.

Xiaobai:
This is where the funeral for the Infected was held, huh... It couldn't be more different from the park we saw this morning.

Xiaobai:
Are these photos for people to pay their respects?

Xiaobai:
Some of these people were still so young...

Xiaobai:
Isn't this... Sixty-Seven?

Xiaobai:
The other half of the photo is covered.

Xiaobai:
(Reaches to move the photo covering it)

Xiaobai:
Huh, that's strange. Who's this man carrying Sixty-Seven?

Xiaobai:
...What's going on?

Xiaobai:
Is that Suzuran chanting?!

Xiaobai:
Suzuran!

Suzuran:
Xiaobai? What are you doing here?

Xiaobai:
We noticed you hadn't returned to the office yet, so I came to look for you.

Suzuran:
Oh, I totally lost track of the time. I was so absorbed in my prayers that I didn't even notice the sun changing places in the sky.

Xiaobai:
Were all the people in the photos patients who recently passed on? I never knew there were so many.

Suzuran:
It's not just our patients, but other Infected as well. They don't have their own cemetery, or enough money for a funeral, so friends and relatives will come hang photos of them to pay their respects.

Xiaobai:
They don't bring anything with them except photos?

Suzuran:
Just having a photo is already pretty good. Some people... don't even have that.

Xiaobai:
I see...

Xiaobai:
Suzuran, were you praying for all the Infected people who've passed?

Suzuran:
All things have a soul, and death is not the end of life. I can't bear to simply leave all these photos like this, so I recite the scriptures a few extra times in hopes of ending their suffering and letting them find peace.

Xiaobai:
Does it really work?

Suzuran:
I'm not sure, but it's all I can do for them.

Xiaobai:
Why does it have to be this way? Not only do Oripathy patients not get a good life, they can't even have a proper burial?

Xiaobai:
I just don't understand.

Xiaobai remembers the park she went to yesterday. Candles and flowers placed on clean, neat grass. All sorts of people attended the funeral, solemn-faced and sorrowful.

But this place couldn't be more different.

The weathered photos, the rusted barbed wire, the strident screeches, and choking smell in the air all told her—

When the Infected pass, the only thing they can take with them is life itself.

Suzuran:
...What's wrong, Xiaobai?

Xiaobai:
Someone...

Xiaobai:
...showed me a very different sort of funeral.

Suzuran:
For a non-Infected person, right?

Xiaobai:
Mm. It was spectacular.

Suzuran:
Whose was it?

Xiaobai:
It was... someone's pet.

Suzuran:
A pet?!

Funeral Parlor Staff:
So, your friend isn't Miss Yuan?!

Xiaobai:
I don't know who you were talking about, but it's definitely not my friend, Xiaoyuan.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Then why didn't you speak up earlier?! You little fraud!

Xiaobai:
I wasn't trying to lie to you! Wasn't it your own misunderstanding?

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Damn it, what awful luck. The boss isn't going to let me hear the end of it.

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Alright, take everything away. Don't leave a single thing behind.

Staff Member Clad in Black:
On it!

Medic Operator:
Still professional to a fault, huh?

Funeral Parlor Staff:
What the hell do you know? This is professionalism!

Funeral Parlor Staff:
Damn it all. Blast this accursed luck.

Xiaobai:
He won't make us pay him back, will he Min-Min?

Medic Operator:
Probably not. You can't exactly go around airing your own dirty laundry in Lungmen. He tried to do this under-the-table, so no one else is responsible for his loss.

Xiaobai:
To be honest... I still kind of feel bad.

Medic Operator:
There's nothing to feel bad about. Two-faced people like him ought to get hoist by their own petard. Let's go find Xiaoyuan. She said she's waiting for you over at that empty lot.

Xiaoyuan:
There you are, Xiaobai! That guy didn't give you any trouble, did he?

Xiaobai:
No, he made his own bed...

Xiaoyuan:
That's good. It's better not to associate with people like that.

Xiaobai:
But I still owe you an apology. I promised you I'd hold a funeral for Sixty-Seven, but I'm empty-handed now that he's taken everything back.

Xiaoyuan:
It's for the best. I wouldn't want to use any of it anyway.

Xiaobai:
But... those things were so beautiful.

Xiaoyuan:
Yes... They were. And might've made us look good, but I couldn't stand seeing them.

Xiaobai:
You weren't satisfied with all that?

Rockrock:
I think what she meant was, all that fancy-pants stuff is for the upper crust. What Xiaoyuan wants is the dignity of an Infected.

Xiaoyuan:
Mm... That's right.

Rockrock:
And what good is dignity if it's borrowed under a fake identity?

Xiaoyuan:
So, thank you for telling me the truth, Xiaobai.

Xiaobai:
No need to thank me. In the end, I couldn't do anything for you.

Rockrock:
(Pats Xiaobai's head)

Rockrock:
C'mon, don't say stuff like that.

Rockrock:
What a person can accomplish in a single lifetime is like a drop in the ocean. But that doesn't represent all that you are, or mean that the time and effort you spent on it are meaningless.

Rockrock:
So, thank you for always trying to lend a helping hand. Even if... you're terrible at fixing things.

Xiaobai:
That doesn't make me feel better at all.

Suzuran:
Heehee. Looks like I need to thank you as well. Maybe you can't treat Oripathy, but you weren't afraid to get close to us.

Xiaobai:
What's so special about that?

Xiaoyuan:
(Extends her hand)

Xiaobai:
What are you doing?

Xiaoyuan:
I'm trying to catch the golden pearls falling from your eyes. They're worth good money!

Xiaobai:
Ah Gen, aren't you going to say something?!

Ah Gen:
Haha, she's not wrong, is she?

Xiaobai:
Ah Gen!

Suzuran:
Everything begins with a single meeting. That's what my dad once told me.

Suzuran:
Then, my mom added that everything must also end with a painful parting.

Suzuran:
So I asked them, what's the difference between a meeting and a parting?

Suzuran:
The answer they gave me was this: the miracles that come between them, one after another.

Suzuran:
So, we gather here to thank the friends who've bravely entered our lives, leaving behind the miracles of understanding, tolerance, and companionship in our empty, desolate hearts.

Suzuran:
These miracles are enough to sustain us for the rest of our lives, solely because—

Suzuran:
I met you, and you met me.

Xiaoyuan:
Thank you, Sixty-Seven.

???:
Xiaobai?! Ah Gen?!

???:
...What are you two doing here too?

Xiaobai:
(Turns around in surprise)

Ah Gen:
This isn't an illusion, is it?

Xiaoyuan:
Sixty-Seven!
