Biu:
Biu!

Cafeteria Staff:
Where are the ingredients?

Cafeteria Staff:
The dishes?

Cafeteria Staff:
Did someone let Kay in?

Gummy:
That thing keeps changing colors! How does it do that?

Ethan:
Where did they find this? It's just like me.

Ethan:
Be nice to him, medical.

Ethan:
Wait, you want to give me a check up too?

Biu:
Biu!

Playing Child:
Where did that toy go?

Truant Child:
Oh no, Instructor Dur-nar must've come to bring me back! What do I do?

Calm Child:
No need to panic. Just say you came looking for the toy that mysteriously went missing, and accidentally stumbled on a secret in the depths of Rhodes Island...

Chiave:
Really?

Chiave:
No joke?

Chiave:
I want in on this.

Calm Child:
?

Biu:
Biu!

Engineering Operator:
â€”?

Engineering Operator:
What the heck are you? What are you doing?!

Engineering Operator:
That's a machine component, you can't eat it!

Engineering Operator:
Oh. Ms. Christine?

Engineering Operator:
Whew, that's a relief. I should thank Phantom. He may look hard to get along with, but he's got a heart of gold.

Engineering Operator:
Have a nice day, madam!

Biu:
Biu...!

Xiaohei:
Gotcha!

Xiaobai:
Why won't you listen, Biu?

Xiaobai:
You'll get hurt if you keep running around like this!

Ah Gen:
What's with this color?

Biu:
Biu!

Ah Gen:
Looks like he ate a lot.

Ah Gen:
So where did you find him, Xiaohei?

Xiaohei:
The room at the end of the hallway.

Xiaohei:
He also went to the toyhouse and the restaurant, and ate some of the food and toys. Without permission.

Xiaobai:
Whoops... Guess we'll have to apologize.

Ah Gen:
Yes, and keep a close eye on him.

Xiaobai:
Okay. Let's go!

Xiaobai:
So Biu didn't cause too much damage, and even caught an operator who skipped class?

Xiaobai:
And that fierce-looking red guy over there... was talking about digging something up, and now he's leaving by himself... Oh, he's looking this way!

Truant Child:
I'm sorry, Instructor Dur-nar! I won't do it again!

Chiave:
Don't worry, brother, I'll complete the mission!

Xiaobai:
...How touching.

Ah Gen:
......

Ah Gen:
Nice job, Biu.

Ah Gen:
So, apparently we won't need to pay any compensation, just do a few missions for them.

Xiaobai:
Does that mean Biu can't come with us?

Ah Gen:
Yeah, but they gave us a cage to put him in.

Ah Gen:
But we still need to find someone to take care of him...

THRM-EX:
Mmph! Ohhhh!

THRM-EX:
The ingenious Master Closure has added so many features with this update!

THRM-EX:
I can feel my passion break through and shine even brighter!

Castle-3:
Our storage capacity has increased by 35.7%, allowing us to download and install more engineering-related files.

Lancet-2:
I've been updated with more first aid procedures and language modules, further enhancing my support capabilities.

Lancet-2:
I especially appreciate the ability to recover deleted files. I recovered a recording of the Doctor snoring from a few years ago. Would you like to hear it?

Xiaobai:
Wow!

Xiaohei:
What are those?

Ah Gen:
Robots? Talking to each other?

THRM-EX:
Good morning, unfamiliar lady and gentlemen! Are you in awe of my perfect form?

THRM-EX:
I knew no one could resist my scorching charisma!

Castle-3:
Unknown personnel detected. Do you require assistance from Rhodes Island?

Lancet-2:
I can help you if you're not feeling well.

Xiaobai:
Wow, they really can talk!

Xiaobai:
Hi there, we're new here, but we have a pet who needs to be looked after while we're away. Do you know anyone who can help us?

Castle-3:
A pet?

THRM-EX:
Not a problem! This update includes 956 volumes on pet care, encompassing every species of plant and animal known to be kept for recreational purposes. I guarantee my burning core will keep them warm!

Lancet-2:
I can also help when they are not feeling well.

Lancet-2:
I have extensive experience in caring for operators.

Xiaobai:
Really? Wow, amazing!

THRM-EX:
More than amazing, incredible! For I, Closure's masterpiece, will singlehandedly solve all your problems!

Xiaohei:
(Whisper) Are they spirits?

Xiaobai:
Smart robots, Xiaohei. Way more advanced than the ones we're used to, though. They may not look like people, but they definitely talk like people.

Xiaobai:
The technology here is incredible.

Xiaobai:
So, he says he knows a lot about caring for pets. I think we can trust him. What about you guys?

Xiaohei:
Hm... Why not?

Ah Gen:
It wouldn't be easy to find someone else on short notice... Alright then.

Xiaohei:
Stay here, Heixiu.

Heixiu:
Hey-xiu!

THRM-EX:
Oooh! What an adorable black blob! Sitting right on my outer frame!

Xiaobai:
Haha. We'll leave things to you then!

Xiaobai:
And don't give Biu any metal or living things. It's dangerous!

Xiaobai:
You can take him out of the cage if Heixiu's around.

Xiaobai:
But he's still very excited, so keep him locked up for a little longer.

Castle-3:
Understood. Please register your names and that of your pets, to be uploaded to the terminal as a mission.

Xiaobai:
Thanks!

Biu:
Biu! Biu!

Castle-3:
Behavior analysis indicates a desire to go out and play.

THRM-EX:
Let him ride on my broad back! I'll show him every corner of Rhodes Island!

Biu:
Biu?

Lancet-2:
He's clawing at the cage. Is he not feeling well?

Lancet-2:
Hey, why does he not talk?

Castle-3:
Querying the latest language modules.

Lancet-2:
I seem to have previously deleted some language data. Allow me to restore it...

Lancet-2:
Eat my shorts, berk, guan ni pi shi...!

Castle-3:
Analysis indicates this is from a collection of Terran expletives that was accidentally added to your library. The engineering department prepared a plugin for you because of this.

Lancet-2:
Apologies... I have re-deleted them.

THRM-EX:
No, no, time waits for no man. I can't hold back my core's burning passion anymore! Put the cage on my back, and let's depart!

Castle-3:
Hold on. According to '100 Tips on Keeping a Pet,' animals demonstrate stress reactions when exposed to an unfamiliar environment.

Castle-3:
This is because they are unsure if it is safe or not. We must create an environment for Biu that is absolutely safe.

THRM-EX:
Acknowledged! Scouting the nearby environment.

THRM-EX:
Scouting! Scouting!

THRM-EX:
Failed! Feature not found!

Castle-3:
I will do it.

Castle-3:
Hallway confirmed safe.

Castle-3:
There is no need to worry, Biu.

Lancet-2:
Is he trembling?

Castle-3:
It may be a stress reaction.

Biu:
Biu! (I wanna go out and play!)

Lancet-2:
What do we do?

Lancet-2:
Let me give him a check-up.

Biu:
Biu! (I wanna go out and play!)

Lancet-2:
Data within expected range. We can go.

THRM-EX:
Ooorah! Let's go!!!

Biu:
Biu!

Lancet-2:
Do you want to go out and play?

Castle-3:
We cannot. The operators said he is still excited, and that it will be dangerous.

Castle-3:
I must scan each room to ensure absolute safety.

Biu:
Chirp...

THRM-EX:
Don't be frustrated, little one! I'll give you the full tour during the long wait!

THRM-EX:
This is the Rhodes Island rest area. Operators put up stalls over there from time to time, where you can buy whatever you like!

Lancet-2:
I doubt Biu would be interested in shopping.

Biu:
Chirp...

THRM-EX:
Then what about the workshop? I can't wait to bring him inside!

Biu:
Biu! Biu! (I wanna go!)

Castle-3:
Scan complete. The garage contains large quantities of metal, indicating a high degree of danger.

Biu:
Chirp...

Castle-3:
Continuing scan of conveyor area.

Operator Passerby:
Hey, what's that?

Curious Operator:
Gummy said he's a big eater! Want some fries?

Biu:
Biu!

Curious Operator:
Oh, he's so cute!

Operator Passerby:
Come on, eat up, I have more where that came from!

THRM-EX:
Apologies, operators, but his owner warned us not to feed him because it's dangerous.

Operator Passerby:
I see.

Curious Operator:
Sorry.

THRM-EX:
So what about the conveyor area? I can't stop myself from overheating anymore!

Biu:
Biu! Biu! (I wanna go!)

Castle-3:
Scan complete. The conveyor area contains conveyor belts, indicating a high degree of danger.

Biu:
Biu...

Castle-3:
Scan complete. A high degree of danger.

Biu:
Biu...

Castle-3:
Scan complete. A high degree of danger.

Castle-3:
Biu, you need to stay within a 5-meter area in this hallway. Both ahead and behind are too dangerous.

Castle-3:
You must remain in this cage until you calm down, to ensure your own safety.

Biu:
Biu...

Lancet-2:
Biu is looking even worse. Is he afraid of the outside?

Biu:
Biu! Biu! (No! No!)

Castle-3:
He became more excited upon hearing your words. I gather you were correct.

Castle-3:
Let's return. Scans indicate a large amount of metal and living beings in these rooms, but no wood, making it dangerous.

Lancet-2:
Here is some disinfected wood. According to 'Pets for Dummies,' it is ideal to feed once every 2.5 hours.

Lancet-2:
Here, an appropriate portion.

Biu:
Biu! Biu! (It's too little!)

Lancet-2:
The serving size has been meticulously calculated. The next feeding will occur in 2.5 hours.

Lancet-2:
According to 'How to Make Your Pet Love You,' one must always be attentive to their physical and mental state.

Lancet-2:
One hour has elapsed since the last check-up. I must perform another check-up to ensure that you are healthy, and continue to do so every hour.

Biu:
......

Biu:
Biu!!! (I'm gonna bite your head off!)

Biu:
Biu... (No, Xiaobai said not to...)

Biu:
Biu... (Sob...)

Lancet-2:
Come on, Biu, turn on your back and let me check your pulse...

Castle-3:
I observed the black blob open Biu's cage, causing Biu to flee into a corner of the hallway.

Castle-3:
I am unable to bend down, so I do not know where he went.

Lancet-2:
But I can hear him run away as soon as we approach.

Lancet-2:
He seems to be avoiding us.

THRM-EX:
I'm sorry, Biu! Were you scorched by my burning passion?!

THRM-EX:
I haven't learned to cool it down, but I'll control myself for your sake if you don't like it!

THRM-EX:
For that is my duty!

Castle-3:
Biu remains stationary beneath a box.

Lancet-2:
Heixiu is still here, which means Biu is safe, but keeping his distance.

Castle-3:
I ran another self-diagnostic. There is no error with my programming. Every step was taken in accordance with the instruction in the books.

Castle-3:
I do not understand why this is happening.

Lancet-2:
Perhaps we should ask other operators for assistance.

Lancet-2:
But we clearly did exactly as instructed, and have not had similar issues when interacting with operators...

Lancet-2:
What could be the issue?

Rockrock:
Biu? Biu? Where are you?

Rockrock:
I just reported back, Lancet-2. I heard Biu is with you, but I don't see him.

THRM-EX:
Hello, Operator Rockrock!

THRM-EX:
While I would love to share the burning warmth of my core with you, we need your help!

Castle-3:
We have a situation here, Operator Rockrock.

Castle-3:
Based on your interactions, how did Ah Gen and the others take care of Biu?

Lancet-2:
We followed the pet care manuals to the letter, but ran into some trouble.

Rockrock:
Hmm... let me think...

Xiaobai:
Uh oh, Biu, what did you just eat?

Biu:
Biu!

Ah Gen:
He's turned black, with red and white dots on him.

Xiaobai:
Eek!

Biu:
Biu!

Rockrock:
Er, I think he just ate the comb I made.

Xiaobai:
Oh, I'm so sorry!

Rockrock:
It's fine, there's plenty of wood for me to make another one.

Rockrock:
But does he eat wood?

Xiaobai:
Yup! Biu loves wood. He even made a big hole in my grandpa's house!

Rockrock:
...And you're that happy about that?

Xiaobai:
Teehee.

Rockrock:
Fine, just give him what he wants.

Rockrock:
He ended up eating most of the materials I brought. And I was planning on making something, too. Oh well.

Biu:
Biu!

Rockrock:
There you are.

Rockrock:
Here, my last two pieces of wood...

THRM-EX:
But it's not feeding timeâ€”

Castle-3:
Your machine has not yet been scannedâ€”

Lancet-2:
It must be disinfected firstâ€”

Biu:
(Swallow)

Biu:
Biu!

Rockrock:
Well, now he's a light yellow. Looks like the wood wasn't thoroughly dried. Thanks, Biu.

Rockrock:
Oh, there you are, Heixiu.

Castle-3:
There was no scan, nor is it feeding time. Your actions are not in accordance with the manuals.

Lancet-2:
But Biu came out of his own accord, and he looks happy.

THRM-EX:
Thank you, Operator Rockrock! You have relit my core, which had gone cold at not being able to solve the problem!

Rockrock:
Yeah, so just do it like that.

Rockrock:
Let him run around and eat whatever he wants. Other people can hold him too, as long as Heixiu's around.

Rockrock:
Don't overthink it.

Lancet-2:
We should relax our parameters? I can try.

Lancet-2:
...Biu, I have a piece of wood here. Would you like it?

Biu:
Chirp!

Castle-3:
You are feeding him directly?

Rockrock:
Yeah. Look at how flat his tummy is. He's hungry. Just give him something to eat and he'll take a nap.

Castle-3:
What about the unfamiliar environment?

Rockrock:
Heixiu's around, so no worries.

THRM-EX:
Can others feed him too?

Rockrock:
Sure, as long as it's not metallic or alive.

Lancet-2:
Understood. Thank you, Operator Rockrock.

Rockrock:
Alright, I gotta get going.

Castle-3:
Have a nice day.

Castle-3:
Lancet-2, I think we can delete some of the books in our library.

Castle-3:
Or all of them.

Castle-3:
Biu has responded better to Rockrock's methods than the ones we have recorded.

THRM-EX:
You're absolutely right! We must warm Biu with our burning cores!

Lancet-2:
I will retain 'Basic Pet Habits,' to ensure that I have essential veterinary knowledge.

Lancet-2:
I was originally designed to care for operators, after all.

Lancet-2:
Is that ok, Biu?

Biu:
Biu!

Castle-3:
Where do you want to go, then?

Biu:
Biu!

THRM-EX:
Wherever you like!

THRM-EX:
My warmth will always be by your side!

Lancet-2:
We can just follow him.

Biu:
Biu!

Biu:
Biu!

THRM-EX:
Wooow, look at that setting sun!

THRM-EX:
It's lit a fire in my core!

THRM-EX:
And look how stylishly Biu eats, like the wind sweeping through the clouds!

Castle-3:
Did you install a module of Yanese expressions, THRM-EX?

THRM-EX:
The amazing Doctor did! They believed it would help me convey my thoughts even better!

THRM-EX:
And it just happens to have an expression that describes Biu perfectly!

Biu:
Biu!

Castle-3:
......

Lancet-2:
......

Castle-3:
According to Ah Gen, they should be about done with their mission soon.

Castle-3:
No wonder Biu wanted to get out.

Lancet-2:
Did you like the food from the cafeteria, Biu?

Biu:
Biu!

Lancet-2:
That said, the staff were a little sad to see you ignore their dishes and go straight for the chopsticks.

Castle-3:
Fortunately, operators from Yan or Higashi are rare, so we have plenty to spare.

Biu:
Biu!

THRM-EX:
Look, Biu likes it!

THRM-EX:
Oooooohhh!

THRM-EX:
Oooooohhh!!!

THRM-EX:
He's approaching me for the very first time! He likes me! I can't control the heat of my coreâ€”

Lancet-2:
â€”â€”

Lancet-2:
Good thing I have the cold spray first-aid module. That seemed effective on you.

Castle-3:
If only Biu could install language modules.

Lancet-2:
My programming has determined that that would be illegal.

Castle-3:
I mean, if only he could communicate with us.

Castle-3:
Taking care of a creature that cannot speak is much more difficult than expected.

Castle-3:
At least we didn't fail the mission.

Castle-3:
Thank you, Biu. I am not equipped with an emotion chip, but my core is instructing me to sing a folk song for you. Would you like me to play it?

Lancet-2:
It feels as though my clock speed is dropping. Why is that?

Lancet-2:
Oh, it's back to normal.

Biu:
Biu! Biu!

Lancet-2:
Ride on me and we'll climb the hill ahead of us. That way, we can see the vehicles headed back to the ship.

Lancet-2:
Would you like to ride on me, or walk by yourself?

Biu:
Biu!

Lancet-2:
You want to go by yourself?

Biu darts through branches, bushes, and rocks towards the peak of the hill.

The setting sun shines on him and the robots.

Castle-3:
Lancet-2, THRM-EX, can you sing?

Castle-3:
I looked up a song that I previously learned.

Castle-3:
'â™ªMy parents want me to be a lawyerâ™ª'

Castle-3:
'â™ªMy grandparents want me to form a familyâ™ª'

Castle-3:
'â™ªBut all I want to do is pick up my brushâ™ª'

Castle-3:
'â™ªAnd draw this sunsetâ™ª'

Lancet-2:
Can Biu draw the sunset, Castle-3?

Castle-3:
I am unable to answer this question.

Castle-3:
But the way he runs around under the setting sun shows that he is happy.

Biu:
Biu! Biu!

Castle-3:
It is what he likes to do.

Castle-3:
â™ªThat is all good, but I love the sunset the mostâ™ª'

THRM-EX:
Hey, I can see the sunset reflecting off the vehicles on their way back!

THRM-EX:
Let's go meet them with my burning passion!

Lancet-2:
Please wait while I update my database.

Lancet-2:
Update complete. Let us go.

Biu:
Biu!

The robots follow behind Biu, leaving long clouds of dust in their wake.

A line of text flashes across Closure's robot monitoring terminal.

'Worry not and enjoy the present.'
