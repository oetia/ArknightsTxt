Plastic Knight:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
Well, look who do we have here!? If it isn't the rising star of the Roar Guards! You made it here early!

Greatmouth Mob:
The audience's still outside, and there's still two hours until the first event of the day. Getting yourself ready for the fight?

Plastic Knight:
It's been a long time since the last time I fought in this kind of arena... It brings back memories.

Greatmouth Mob:
Right, I'm curious. I mean, your title's 'Plastic', and it's one of your main selling points...

Greatmouth Mob:
But aren't you already at the top of your knightclub's rankings after last month's competitions? What do you need to push yourself so hard for?

Plastic Knight:
...It's what my sponsor wants. Nothing I can do about it. I had to cancel my holiday for this.

Greatmouth Mob:
Oh, you're after that, aren't you?

Plastic Knight:
Did you have to ask?

Greatmouth Mob:
Oh, I hit bullseye, huh? Guess we have something to look forward to today...

???:
Certainly, we have something to look forward to... However, before that, please allow me to have a chat with Mr. 'Plastic' Szewczyk, one-on-one.

Plastic Knight:
And you are...?

???:
I work on the Major's preliminaries. Here is my business card, Mr. Szewczyk.

Plastic Knight:
...You 'work on' them, huh? What do you want?

???:
I'm merely here to inform you of this.

???:
The Roar Guards Company has requested that you wear its latest Jack 2 model body armor in your one-on-one match, or 'duel' as it is more commonly called, with Maria Nearl, and to prolong the match for as long as possible.

Plastic Knight:
What? But the materials that went into the new armor isn't meant for competition use—

???:
No matter. The Nearls' comeback has attracted countless press to today's events. This is a perfect opportunity.

???:
They've already made a significant investment to secure that long term trade agreement. They merely needed a gamble of reasonable odds. A test, and also a publicity stunt.

???:
For your services, the Roar Guards' publicity department has also promised quite a significant down payment... Three times your post-tax total income last year.

???:
With just this one match, Mr. Szewczyk, you'll be earning enough to buy out an entire village in your homeland.

Plastic Knight:
...Do they really have to go that far?

???:
The exposure and publicity are just secondary objectives. They'll become the talk of the town. This, along with the profits the Major will bring in, will give the Roar Guards more of a... yes... more of a say at the General Chamber of Commerce.

???:
After all, having a voice at such venues is very important, wouldn't you agree?

Plastic Knight:
If it's what my sponsors want... and there's money in it, who am I to complain?

???:
Your assistance is much appreciated. We know very well that you, too, have some special needs...

???:
Oh yes, have you met the Nearl family's youngest daughter yet?

Plastic Knight:
I've seen her debut match. She's not bad, but still a disappointment compared to the Radiant Knight.

Plastic Knight:
...Are you worried that I'll lose?

???:
No... The thought never crossed my mind. Pardon me. We've already sent a brand new set of equipment, along with a list of all the necessary precautions for the new armor, to your residence. Please...

Plastic Knight:
......

Old Knight:
...Did you all have to start hanging out here this early?

Old Craftsman:
What? There's just an hour and a half left until Maria's match! It's her first bout since her intensive training! There's no way I'd miss it!

Bald Marcin:
Hahaha, well said. Everything is on the house today.

Old Knight:
*Sigh*... What a ruffian...

Old Knight:
......

Bald Marcin:
Here, your 'Thorn Tear.' It's not often you order something this strong. Are you worried about her?

Old Knight:
If I count from the day Zofia had me train her in swordsmanship, it took her four whole years to get to the preliminaries... But Maria only had four weeks.

Old Knight:
We should keep an eye on them. When it's time to call it quits, that's when they need to stop. We mustn't let them go overboard.

Bald Marcin:
Hahaha... They're just a bunch of young, passionate knights. It brings me back to the time when Margaret decided to throw her name in the hat.

Old Knight:
But they are nothing like her.

Bald Marcin:
Now, trust in her a little.

Bald Marcin:
As long as she's creative with how she accumulates her points, getting qualified for the Major isn't really anything so difficult.

Old Knight:
That might work for your everyday contestants, but.. I'm not sure if that'll work for Maria...

Old Knight:
I have a feeling... there's going to be trouble.

Old Craftsman:
What's the matter now, V? Why are you always pouring cold water on everything? What, are you jealous? Have you no shame?

Old Knight:
You want to say that again?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Laaaaadies and gentlemen! Welcommmmme to the Roar Arena!

Greatmouth Mob:
You're in for a treat today at this arena, fully sponsored by the Roar Guards Company! 'Roar Guards, even the winds will bow to you!'

Greatmouth Mob:
If you don't have an independent knight to put your money on yet, then let me introduce to you once again—

Greatmouth Mob:
It's been a long month since she became the talk of the town with her debut match, and who knows what kind of training she's gone through in preparation for this day!

Greatmouth Mob:
Please join me and welcome the cutest contestant to ever grace the Roar Arena, sister to the legend, the Nearl family's youngest ever competition knight!

Greatmouth Mob:
Maaaaarrriiiiiia Nearllll!

Tourist:
I bet my entire fortune on you! Nearl!

Tourist:
*Whistle* Radiant Knight! Lil' Radiant Knight!

Zofia:
This atmosphere really is over-the-top... Hey, you! You're blocking my view! Sit down!

Zofia:
(I wonder how long it's been since the last time I was in the audience.)

Zofia:
(Okay, Maria... Don't get nervous.)

Maria:
(Take a deep breath... Deep breath.)

Maria:
(Mmn... There's so many people looking at me...!)

Maria:
(No, I shouldn't worry about my surroundings so much... Deep breath... Deep breath...)

Greatmouth Mob:
Everyone! Please calm down! I know how excited you all are right now, but please try to calm down a little!

Greatmouth Mob:
Try to give the young lady a little space. If she gets stage fright and calls it quits, the Roar Guards won't be issuing any refunds.

Greatmouth Mob:
That's right! Support her with the cash in your wallets, not your voices! There's nothing more exciting than seeing your favorite knightess reign victorious thanks to your support, especially the monetary kind!

Bald Marcin:
Looks like Greatmouth Mob got paid off by the Roar Guards.

Old Knight:
What a lowlife. *Spit*.

Old Craftsman:
Heh, look at the Roar Guards trying to take on Raythean at their own game. They don't know their place, do they?

Old Craftsman:
Even the putty I played with back when I was a kid lasts longer than the armors they churn out.

Old Knight:
Why don't I see you working at some big-name company, then?

Old Craftsman:
Over my dead body! I've sworn off building equipment for knights!

Old Knight:
That's why you still haven't paid off your tab for a whole year already! Because you don't take work that pays.

Old Craftsman:
I haven't picked up my tab because I've got bills to pay! Why else would I be fixing pipes? I'm not even a plumber!

Bald Marcin:
Hahaha... Speaking of which, Old Lady Layla left you a message. She wants you to fix some lights for her son...

Old Knight:
Well, are you going?

Old Craftsman:
I... err... Who's Maria up against?

Greatmouth Mob:
Alright—! With a crowd this enthusiastic, how could the Roar Arena and its sponsor, the Roar Guards, let anyone down?

Greatmouth Mob:
The one who will go face to face with the Radiant Knight's sister is none other than the vanguard who led Roar K.C., the knightclub proudly sponsored by the Roar Guards, to the top 100 in the last Major.

Greatmouth Mob:
Yes, I can hear you complaining! I've got to get a word in for our sponsors. That's no less important than the events themselves! And so—

Greatmouth Mob:
Now hold your horses, we're getting there. Our heroine will soon be facing the judgement of the fiercest storm of her life!

Greatmouth Mob:
His might and economical title are unmatched on today's roster! Please join me and welcome the 'Plastic', Szewczyk!

Fan:
Szewczyk! Szewczyk!

Fan:
Take her down, Szewczyk! All my money's on the line here! Don't disappoint us!

Greatmouth Mob:
The 'Plastic' Szewczyk, everyone, and check out his armor from the Roar Guards Company, made with the newest materials! Will the latest in Columbian armor technology prove to be the decisive element in this match?!

Greatmouth Mob:
That's right. The Roar Guards provide all enterprising knights with the most bespoke, personalized equipment services! Maintenance, upgrades, retrofits, you name it! We'll craft up a storm in our workshops!

Greatmouth Mob:
Don't forget, 'Roar Guards, even the winds will bow to you!'

Plastic Knight:
Well, I didn't expect to see you here... and I definitely didn't expect to find you in the audience while I'm in the ring.

Zofia:
—Szewczyk.

Plastic Knight:
'Whislash' Zofia. I thought you'd never set foot in this place again after your injury, lest you humiliate yourself.

Zofia:
Hah, you only know to kick a lady when she's down. You're still all talk and no show.

Zofia:
Remember how many points I snatched from you when we faced each other in the prelims, Plastic Toy?

Plastic Knight:
If you were just a bit smarter... Whatever, why am I even talking to you about this?

Plastic Knight:
Was it you who trained that kid? In just one month?

Zofia:
Well, you better stop talking to me and keep your eye on the arena if you don't want her to break you like a toy.

Plastic Knight:
I see. Well, looks like I can look forward to a decent fight...

Zofia:
You'd better watch out, Plastic Toy.

Plastic Knight:
Heh... We'll see how that turns out.

Greatmouth Mob:
Oh? Ohh? It looked like Szewczyk talked to someone in the audience briefly before he stepped into the ring. And who would've thought? It's 'Whislash', Zofia! What a surprise we have in our audience today!

Zofia:
*Spit*.

Greatmouth Mob:
Now, the two knights have entered the arena. Keep your eyes on them! You don't want to miss any action!

Greatmouth Mob:
Everyone! Everyone! Do you see Szewczyk's armor shining under the lights? Do you see Maria's beautiful blond hair fluttering in the wind?

Greatmouth Mob:
Anything you see will soon be consumed by the most intense bloodbath of the day! They'll be going all out to bring each other down! Rules—Who cares? This is the Kazimierz Major!

Greatmouth Mob:
Before our dimwitted judges make their decision, you can and should support your favorite! Of course! Your support will directly influence the outcome!

Greatmouth Mob:
If your purse is feeling a little light, you can scream all you want. Not that it'll do anything but give yourself some unearned pride and the rest of us an earache. If you dig deep, you can buy some chips to support your contestant!

Greatmouth Mob:
Okay, here comes the booing again, but guess what? To celebrate the Major reaching its highest number of contestants ever, the Roar Arena's cut's been lowered to an unheard of 50%!

Greatmouth Mob:
For every ten gold coins you spend, five of them will help your favorite contestants! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

Greatmouth Mob:
Of course! The Roar Arena isn't just raking in all those commissions for nothing. If you've got your money on one of our contestants, as long as they win in some way, you'll have the chance to make some big bucks!

Greatmouth Mob:
The odds? Forget it! The odds are in your own hands! The bankroll? It's what you're throwing down for your knights! Don't hesitate! It's time to fork out anything you've got for your warriors!

Greatmouth Mob:
And now without further ado! May our contestants please step forward! On your marks!

Maria:
...Grandpa... Margaret... here I go.

Maria:
My name is Maria Nearl! My family motto is, 'Fear neither hardship nor darkness!'
