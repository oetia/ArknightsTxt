Spokesman Czarny:
And this is your glass.

Corporate Employee:
Thank you. Thank you.

Spokesman Czarny:
The Roar Guards Company offers a wealth of beverages to its members. I truly envy them. They possess the luxury of standing here and observing each knight's magnificent display.

Spokesman Czarny:
Tell me. You are a good person, correct?

Corporate Employee:
Er...

Spokesman Czarny:
Have you broken the law before?

Corporate Employee:
...No.

Spokesman Czarny:
Have you ever committed a wrongdoing?

Corporate Employee:
No, of course not, never...

Spokesman Czarny:
So in other words, you are a diligent worker who earns his pay for himself and his family. Doesn't that make you a good person?

Corporate Employee:
Y-Yes, if you put it that way, I'd definitely be a good person, a good person like so many others in Kazimierz...

Spokesman Czarny:
Indeed, so many others. Here. Let us toast to the good people.

Corporate Employee:
Ah. Cheers.

Spokesman Czarny:
Tell me. If there were some who sought to deprive good people of their work, to deprive good people of their way of life, could those possibly be good people, now?

Corporate Employee:
What do you...?

Spokesman Czarny:
Even the countryside farmers, done tending their fields for the day, will look forward to that competition knight broadcast from the city.

Spokesman Czarny:
For hundreds of thousands... possibly millions of Kazimierz's industrial people, the Major is a part of life. And they are all good people, by and large, my friend.

Corporate Employee:
So, you mean...

Spokesman Czarny:
Suppose, one day, the Major was gone... that overnight, the business had vanished.

Spokesman Czarny:
Who would now support our campaign knights' expenditures, which grow annum by annum? Who would vie for Kazimierz's economic standing, and so stave off foreign incursions?

Spokesman Czarny:
My friend, tell me. Are those who would see that happen—bad people?

Corporate Employee:
......

Spokesman Czarny:
You are a good person, and they would deprive you of your own living to crown their ancient sense of 'honor.'

Spokesman Czarny:
We all rely on others to pave the way. We've given the vast majority—even the Infected—the chance to live...

Spokesman Czarny:
And so those 'bad people' would ignore that, their country and all its citizens, for their own inconsequential, self-centered consolation.

Spokesman Czarny:
My friend. You are a good person, correct?

Tourist:
This place is Nearl's regular bar, right? Whoo-wee, now this is what I call Kazimierzey!

Tourist:
Hey, Boss! Think Maria Nearl might come here today?

Bald Marcin:
That's down to your own square luck.

Old Knight:
Business been good lately?

Bald Marcin:
Thanks to Maria.

Old Knight:
When's the last time we got so many in here? Back with Zofia?

Bald Marcin:
Knight's the magic word. Most people're here just for that. Don't even ask me which of the media monkeys said it...

Old Knight:
Not happy even for the money?

Bald Marcin:
Wasn't the idea to give the two of them somewhere nice and quiet to relax?

Old Craftsman:
Hey, Marcin. Think about carving it into this seat here, 'Kowal ONLY.' Don't wanna wait for a spot next time I come by.

Bald Marcin:
Cough up a naming fee and I'll agree.

Old Craftsman:
Tch.

Tourist:
Whoa, whoa, Nearl's really here! It's literally her!

Tourist:
Quick! Don't let the chance slide, go get a picture!

Maria:
Er, thanks, thanks... picture? You mean me? Sorry, I'm a little...

Zofia:
Alright, alright, make way, you lot—

Tourist:
Hold on... you're Zofia! The 'Whislash' Zofia!

Tourist:
Hey, the rumors were true! 'Whislash' Zofia is the actual coach of the new Nearl!

Tourist:
Miss Zofia! I've watched your matches before! They really shook me!

Zofia:
(Oh, well, we're done for.)

Maria:
(A-Auntie! Think of something, quick!)

Tourist:
Maria, I love you!

Tourist:
What did you just say?!

Old Knight:
Hey, take your fights outside.

Old Craftsman:
You've gotta be at least this old to brawl in here.

Maria:
—Mister Kowal! Mister Vogelweide!

Bald Marcin:
All customers, listen up! To celebrate our two old regulars and their outstanding performance, prices today are all 20% off!

Bald Marcin:
Everybody sit down and get your orders ready! All drinks and snacks are limited supplies only! Once we're out, we're out!

Tourist:
Discounts? Could it get any better?

Tourist:
Hold on... hold on... the bald guy there, you think he's...

Bald Marcin:
Just old Marcin, nothing more. Go on. What's your business?

Tourist:
Marcin...? You're the real 'Tremoriron' Marcin... *sobbing*... Today's just too blessed... Give me a 'Marcin Special'...

Maria:
F... finally... I've never seen this place so lively before...

Zofia:
Bless your heart, Marcin. I'll help you recoup the costs later.

Bald Marcin:
Hah hah hah. If you think 20% off'll sink my bar, you'd be selling old Marcin short.

Zofia:
...Crafty hand, you.

Old Knight:
W-What? Can I keep drinking or not?!

Old Craftsman:
Place's empty, old boy. Who're you even drinking with?

Old Knight:
I—*geurgh*—

Old Craftsman:
Don't throw up here—do it outsi—God! Your old damned bones!

Bald Marcin:
Let's get down to business, then. Closing hours and all.

Zofia:
Closing hours are where we're booked in, hm?

Bald Marcin:
Hah hah hah, they're when this little bar's really open for service.

Zofia:
Maria... you've gotten enough points already.

Bald Marcin:
You've been winning fight after fight. It's incredible.

Maria:
Th... there's been an element of luck to it...

Zofia:
As long as you can maintain the score, dig your heels in on it until the end of the season, that'll be the best plan... But I'm worried about something else.

Maria:
Auntie?

Zofia:
...Maria, the next match is a race. Races don't make for great changes in points, so it should be a safe bet.

Zofia:
And then after that, don't participate in any more matches.

Maria:
Wha?

Maria:
B... but, just staying...

Zofia:
You've done plenty enough. Victory's at hand now.

Zofia:
Surely you've noticed it too... Maria, a lot of people are paying attention to you right now.

Zofia:
We just need to keep the pace. Wait until the points are finalized, and you'll win a knight's title, and we'll have achieved our goal.

Zofia:
Okay? Just listen to your sister. This will all be for the best—

Maria:
......

Maria:
But this... this isn't going to change anything at all... If I don't keep going, the Nearl family's still going to be stuck in this position...

Maria:
Uncle Młynar wouldn't approve of doing things this way, either...

Zofia:
Młynar? He's like talking to a brick wall! He wouldn't approve no matter what you decided to do. You know that better than anyone, don't you?

Zofia:
Just don't think about it too much, okay? Maria... this is all for the best. It's this or nothing.

Maria:
Auntie... what happened?

Bald Marcin:
......

Zofia:
You don't know how deep the Major really goes... You don't know what it is you'll be up against at all...

Maria:
Auntie!

Zofia:
...In the arena, victory will never belong to a knight. Victory will only ever belong to Kazimierz, belong to... to the corporations.

Zofia:
If you truly don't want to work with them, you shouldn't have joined the Major in the first place. If we keep doing things your way... Maria, we need to know where to stop.

Bald Marcin:
Zofia. What did you find out?

Zofia:
...That Słoma employee I know told me about some rumblings. Maria's popularity has thrown her into the Knights Association's executive sights far sooner than anyone else...

Zofia:
If Maria doesn't stop where she should, they'll start making moves! No matter what it is they're planning for us, we don't have to grin and bear any of it!

Zofia:
So, Maria, listen to your sister, okay?

Maria:
I... I don't get it... If we don't want to be controlled by them, we have to bow to them? Where's the difference?

Zofia:
Maria! This is no joking matter—!

Maria:
I know—

Zofia:
You could die in the arena!

Maria:
...'Flametail' said so too. I haven't seen what the significance of the Major really is...

Maria:
I know I might genuinely have no idea what cruelties she was referring to... but I didn't enter the tournament for fun, either!

Maria:
I don't care about injuries, I don't care about accidents, I don't even care if I have to sacrifice—

Zofia:
That's enough!

Maria:
Ah... I'm really sorry, Auntie, I didn't mean...

Zofia:
That's not a 'sacrifice' at all. And I don't want to watch you suffer for any of this, either...

Zofia:
I see how you're thinking. You really need to learn when enough is enough!

Maria:
...I don't think I should stop here.

Maria:
Even if I don't pass the qualifiers, even if I fall short of my goal, I should be fighting for my own cause... I should be striving to win until I can't win anymore!

Zofia:
...Alright, I get it.

Maria:
Auntie...!

Zofia:
I'm convinced you should stop. You don't understand the Major. You can't understand... the sheer outrage Margaret's actions caused back then.

Zofia:
If Kazimierz really was a fair country, everything you've said could be true. But that's not how it goes. Any idiot can see how flimsy all our rules are, and how trivial it is to leave them in pieces.

Zofia:
You're still an untitled, unaffiliated, independent knight, Maria. I can apply to the Knights Association for a suspension on your tournament campaign.

Zofia:
So there.

Maria:
...Auntie!

Bald Marcin:
Cool down, Maria. And let Zofia cool down a little too.

Bald Marcin:
She means you well.

Maria:
...I know.

Bald Marcin:
But Zofia's right. A knight doesn't win the Major by will alone.

Bald Marcin:
The corps were only interested in giving 'the new Nearl knight' the chance to take root and start growing. When they decide to reap you, they'll come out with their sickles, no second thoughts.

Bald Marcin:
Knights get one right, and it's to apply to the events... beyond the Major, corps have every rank and result in vice grips. Knights don't get a choice any way or how.

Bald Marcin:
If Zofia's heard the truth, and the company insiders are making noise...

Maria:
......

Bald Marcin:
Maybe we should be picking up on the signals. Paying attention, at least.

Old Knight:
Weugh... whassappenin'? Swear I saw Zofia storming out just now...

Old Craftsman:
What's the long face for, girl? Didn'tcha win? What's to argue after winning?

Bald Marcin:
You two, stop making it worse...

Maria:
...I-I'm going home.

Maria:
I have a race coming up, and I still need to do my equipment maintenance...

Maria:
......

Maria:
...*Sigh*.

Platinum:
...*Sigh*.

Maria & Platinum:
Hm...?

Maria:
......

Platinum:
......

Maria:
(She's beautiful, but she carries the scent of blood... is she a knight?)

Platinum:
(Maria Nearl. Young... even younger than she looked in the material.)

Maria & Platinum:
(Shame.)
