Greatmouth Mob:
Everyone! Everybody! Would you look at that!

Greatmouth Mob:
Before this match began, who could've known that this fight—this standoff between the renowned Nearl family and the Plastic Knight—would've turned out like this?

Greatmouth Mob:
Maria Nearl! The girl who inherited the Nearl name! Who could've seen this coming—!?

Greatmouth Mob:
She's completely cornered by Szewczyk! And she's got no way to turn the tables!

Greatmouth Mob:
That won't do! Nearl! Do you know how much money our audience has bet on you just because of your name?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Uh... Say that again? Oh, it's not actually that much, going by where the the odds stand? Hey now, you should all have a little more faith in the girl! Isn't her face worth something to you?!

Maria:
Ughh—!

Plastic Knight:
I was expecting something on Zofia or the Radiant Knight's level, but is this all you've got...?

Plastic Knight:
What a let-down.

Greatmouth Mob:
That's the Roar Guards' old war horse! He's using the artificial environment and his speed to his advantage! The poor girl's got nowhere to run!

Greatmouth Mob:
He stops! He shoots! And then he's on the move again! This is his 'Plastic Rhythm'!

Maria:
(I-I can't see his movements! Why? He's not even as fast as Zofia—)

Maria:
(He stopped! I've gotta block—!)

Plastic Knight:
Too slow!

Zofia:
—Maria! To your left!

Maria:
What—Uhgh!

Greatmouth Mob:
Szewczyk just hopped on the wall there and made a beautiful burst of shots. My god, if he landed those shots where he really wanted them, we'd have to cut the broadcast short! That was close!

Greatmouth Mob:
Even though he's been hit a few times already, his armor is so tough, there's absolutely no sign of damage at all! Yet he's able to move around in it so quickly! Astounding!

Greatmouth Mob:
You see that, everyone? That's the latest product from the Roar Guards! The Jack 2 Special High Performance Rubber Paste!

Greatmouth Mob:
This fantastic product can be yours today! But wait! We're even handing out 5% off coupons at the front of the arena right now! Be sure not to miss this opportunity!

???:
So... That's Nearl?

???:
Hold on, is she really the Radiant Knight's sister?

???:
...What, are you disappointed?

???:
Of course not... Why would I be disappointed by something like this? What about you?

???:
Me? Well... Let's keep watching a little longer. We paid good money for our tickets after all.

???:
I hate the atmosphere here... and Mob never fails to get on my nerves.

???:
I don't understand how he manages to stir up the crowd when he commentates like that... And those advertisements... Is anyone actually running out to buy anything he's advertising?

???:
There's probably a few.

???:
After all, letting viewers put everything off their minds and go with the crowd is what these knight competitions do best, wouldn't you agree?

???:
Hey, take a look over there. In the front row. 'Whislash' Zofia.

???:
Not just her. There's more over there... Some lesser-known knights.

Plastic Knight:
...We have about ten minutes left.

Plastic Knight:
Looks like your luck hasn't run out yet. If I didn't have to drag this out, you would've begged me to spare your life long ago!

Maria:
Nngh—!

Plastic Knight:
Just surrender, kid.

Plastic Knight:
You don't know the rules here. The judges aren't going to stop us until I have arrows sticking through all your arms and legs.

Plastic Knight:
You don't need to do this. Throw in the towel.

Maria:
I-I can't give up...!

Plastic Knight:
Well, if you've already dug your heels in... You have her eyes, but, other than that, you're nothing.

Plastic Knight:
Very well... Let's see how long you can keep this up.

Maria:
—!

Zofia:
Training is nothing like real combat.

Zofia:
No one's going to try to be polite and take you head-on.

Zofia:
Besides, each contestant has her own equipment, weapon, and fighting style. On top of that, each battle takes place on different terrain, there are different traps and support equipment... Any one of which could influence the outcome.

Maria:
Gathering intel sounds really important...

Zofia:
That's right, and that's where the problem is. There is no way you can remember the weaknesses of each and every one of the knights in the Kazimierz Major, but most if not all of them have their eyes on you.

Maria:
Ohh...

Zofia:
There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to winning the competitions, but if we have to come up with something...

Zofia:
Bring out the best in yourself—In other words, give it your all.

Maria:
So, you mean... you've got nothing?

Maria:
Ow!

Zofia:
Observe and think. You don't come up with solutions before you actually face the challenges.

Zofia:
You need to analyze the situation within an extremely short amount of time and come up with the appropriate response. That's not an easy thing to do.

Maria:
—To the left!

Plastic Knight:
You got lucky there.

Greatmouth Mob:
Ohh?! This is the first time Nearl has countered his attack—Nope, all she did was block his feint!

Greatmouth Mob:
The vote count hasn't changed! Szewczyk still has the advantage, and an overwhelming one at that!

Observe. Think.

Maria—

You are gifted with a pair of pegasian eyes.

Maria:
(His knight armor—Jack 2?)

Maria:
(The Roar Guards have thirteen different products, and none are called that—)

Plastic Knight:
...Waiting for me to strike? Fool!

Several arrows buzz past Maria, sending strands of hair fluttering in the air and leaving behind a trail of smoke and dust in the air.

Maria:
(It enhances his mobility... No, there's more to it than that... but this model...)

Maria:
...Let's give it a try.

Greatmouth Mob:
She's charging! 'Plastic' Szewczyk has been toying with Nearl so far this entire match, but she's finally charging him for the first time!

Greatmouth Mob:
She dodged the flames burning through the crevices and the artificial frost! She's fast! Very fast—But Szewczyk is still not moving away! Is he going to fight her head on?!

Plastic Knight:
It's suicide for an archer to fight a swordsman head on—

Maria:
You won't get away—!

Plastic Knight:
I'm not going anywhere!

The two contestants clash. Arrows whiz past Maria as she endures the intense pain on her face, yet she does not attack.

She steps atop her opponent's armor and flips into the air. Naturally, Szewczyk did not expect the confrontation to be this friendly—

The coldness he feels in his hand, the low roar, and the unnatural smoke wafting in the air—

Greatmouth Mob:
What's this? Would you believe it?! We aren't just getting a knight match for our money today; we've got a circus show going on here!

Greatmouth Mob:
Maria has finally closed in on Szewczyk, but she hasn't attacked even once! Is this her idea of a taunt?!

Zofia:
...It's not that she's not attacking; she can't attack. If she didn't dodge that, her left arm would've been crippled by now.

Zofia:
Plastic's trying to drag the fight on. He's trying to get sponsorships by putting on a show... *sigh*.

Zofia:
Maria...

Plastic Knight:
What... did you just do?

Maria:
It's getting a little hot in here, isn't it... Mr. Szewczyk?

Maria:
Haven't the Roar Guards thought out the ventilation issues in that new armor you're wearing?

Plastic Knight:
...That's something for the craftsmen to worry about, not for two dueling knights to have a discussion over.

Maria:
(High performance, lightweight... It's obviously trying to replicate that high-end Victorian workmanship and the Originium skeletal reinforcement lining technology from Columbia...)

Maria:
(They probably left out air vents because of some technical issues... No, maybe just aesthetics...)

Maria:
(In that case... How much longer till it reaches its limits?)

Maria:
(He moves and shoots, then repeats. I know his pattern, but I can't match his speed.)

Maria:
(Wait, no... He moves, then stops, and then he shoots... Hold on...?)

Greatmouth Mob:
We had a little interlude just now, but both sides have regained their composure! They pulled away from each other, and we're back on track—Hang on!

Greatmouth Mob:
Maria's not hesitating at all! She took off right away and she's trying to match Szewczyk's speed! But! There's still some difference between them!

Plastic Knight:
You don't know when to give up, do you? Hasn't 'Whislash' taught you not to make chase when you have the lower hand in speed?

Szewczyk briskly stops and turns. In no time, he has already replaced his bowstring.

Maria:
(Now!)

Greatmouth Mob:
A flash! The stadium is suddenly filled with a blinding light—Let's take this opportunity to look at all the advantages of Raythean's latest sunglasses, part of its Pioneer line of apparel!

Greatmouth Mob:
(What? Advertisements? Who gives a crap when they've already thrown all that money on this?)

Plastic Knight:
Nnn—!

Plastic Knight:
She's not attacking—What—

Maria:
(He's not attacking or moving! Again!)

Maria:
—Hiyaah!

Plastic Knight:
——

Greatmouth Mob:
He blocked it! Szewczyk, a crossbowman, managed to block Maria's attack without even breaking a sweat!

Greatmouth Mob:
Our Nascent Nearl, Maria, is running out of ideas!

Maria:
(I knew it!)

Plastic Knight:
So the Arts were all just a fluke... Was there even a point to that? It was your last chance.

Maria:
Mr. Szewczyk, how's the automatic cooling system doing for you during combat?

Plastic Knight:
Well, color me surprised... If you figured that out so quickly, maybe you should've been a mechanic, not a knight.

Maria:
—Mr. Szewczyk, you're a really strong knight. Your speed and techniques are impeccable.

Maria:
Sadly, it looks like you chose to be a corporate product tester instead.

Plastic Knight:
...None of your business, and I suggest you stop underestimating the Roar Guards' technological prowess.

Maria:
—Is that so?

Greatmouth Mob:
Ohh?! Maria's willingly pulled herself back! What's the meaning of this?! What were the two of them talking about?!

Greatmouth Mob:
I'm sure our audience is curious about that, too. I've always been an advocate for giving the knights mics—Who doesn't want to listen in on our contestants trash-talking each other?!

???:
Well, the crowd's getting all fired up again.

???:
It seems like Maria Nearl figured something out.

???:
Yeah, it looks like it. Well, no matter. Knights should spend more time thinking instead of always trying to brute force a win.

Plastic Knight:
Cheap tricks...!

Greatmouth Mob:
He stops! He shoots! Szewczyk's starting his hunt again—Wait! Maria sidestepped the obstacles on the ground, and she's dashing straight towards Szewczyk!

Plastic Knight:
Hmm?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Szewczyk! Szewczyk's not moving an inch! Is he going to take that hit straight on like last time?!

Plastic Knight:
*Warning sounds* Tsk! This stupid cooling system—!

Maria:
Sorry about this!

Plastic Knight:
Don't get cocky!

Plastic Knight:
Ugh?!

Maria:
It's suicide for an archer to fight a swordsman head on—I couldn't have said it better myself!

Plastic Knight:
(It hasn't cooled down yet. I need to keep my distance!)

Plastic Knight:
Out of the way!

Greatmouth Mob:
Szewczyk—! Unbelievable! With just his crossbow and his bayonet, he blocked her flawlessly!

Maria closes her eyes.

She has seen this technique countless times, and she has tried to imitate it just as many.

A move she has copied over and over and over.

Zofia:
Yeah... now I remember...

Zofia:
That backhand thrust... It's the same one that took Margaret to victory.

Plastic Knight:
You...

Plastic Knight:
This is impossible...

Maria:
Haghhh—

Maria:
Th-That hurts...

Greatmouth Mob:
—Wh-Who could've seen this coming?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Szewczyk still had the advantage just a second ago, but she knocked him cold in just one blow! There is no question. The winner is Maria!

Greatmouth Mob:
But how did she do that? Did we just witness a repeat of that miraculous final match?! Maria Nearl! Has she been hiding her true strength this whole time?!

???:
Well, well. She did it.

???:
...Let's go.

???:
Not gonna keep watching?

???:
What's there to watch? Better go home and fix up your weapon, don't leave any weaknesses for your opponent to capitalize on.

???:
Hahaha, you're right about that. Wait up!

Zofia:
Maria... you really did it.

Zofia:
...Is this really a good thing?

???:
Mr. Mob.

Greatmouth Mob:
(Hey! This stage's for commentators! Get off!)

???:
Shh... Quiet. Do not let the audience hear you... They cannot see me where I am standing, so relax.

???:
I am just here to relay Mr. Pavel's thoughts on the matter...

Greatmouth Mob:
Pa... Y-You dare call him by name... What do you want?

???:
It appears Szewczyk lost this match out of ineptitude. This has been a huge disappointment to the Roar Guards Company.

Greatmouth Mob:
You mean...

???:
Quiet now... There are some things that are best kept unsaid. I am sure you are aware what that means.

???:
Now go, the audience is waiting.

Greatmouth Mob:
Everyone—! Everyone!

Greatmouth Mob:
Going by the odds and votes, this has undoubtedly been a huge upset! This match is sure to be the talk of the town for days to come!

Greatmouth Mob:
An independent, untitled knight managed to defeat the Roar K.C.'s vanguard! It looks like Maria Nearl's Originium Arts are a force to be reckoned with! She defeated the 'Plastic' Szewczyk, through pure skill!

Greatmouth Mob:
Was it because Szewczyk underestimated her opponent, a newbie? Was it their conversation that determined the victor? This is why I said the knights should get mics—

Greatmouth Mob:
In any case! Whatever excuses you've got, it's all too late now! I'm honored to announce the results of the first match of the day!

Greatmouth Mob:
The winner—Maria Nearl!
