Zofia:
...The match started already.

Zofia:
I've got to... mm?

Zofia:
Wait, why is my sword here?

Servant:
Ah, Miss Maria brought it over earlier.

Servant:
She said she already gave it some adjustments, too. She guarantees it should be like new.

Zofia:
......

Servant:
Byah—!

Zofia:
Mm... light and limber. I've missed this feeling.

Servant:
P-Please be careful! Oh, my, you've broken the balustrade again! We just had the stonesmith repair that in the Victorian style last year...

Zofia:
Oh, you may as well just have someone renovate the whole place. In fact, you're in charge of that.

Servant:
Really, another one of your whims?

Zofia:
As long as someone can live in it...

Zofia:
......

Servant:
Miss?

Zofia:
...Ah, no, I just... feel like I miss something, suddenly.

Zofia:
This sword... Maria's grandfather gave it to me.

Servant:
Miss Maria calls you an aunt, doesn't she?

Zofia:
Family hierarchy is one unending wordy mess. I still remember how Margaret put it—'This is your... your... you know what, she's your auntie.'

Zofia:
I'm only about as old as them, aren't I? Really—auntie?

Servant:
You're very young. So young, and managing such a family enterprise. We take great pride in you, Miss Zofia.

Zofia:
I snapped up all this land in one breath. Oh, back then, was I thinking I'd prove myself as well? Prove myself worthy of the 'Nearl' name, maybe? Worthy of the Radiant Knight...

Zofia:
No... now's no time to pine for the past.

Servant:
The car is all ready for you. Or do you think running there yourself might be faster?

Zofia:
I think that's obvious—

Greatmouth Mob:
Just like a hunter toying with his prey, the Left-hand Knight keeps letting his foe gather herself and try again, and each time, he strikes Maria Nearl back down!

Bald Marcin:
......

Old Knight:
Marcin! We're back! How's it going?!

Old Craftsman:
Why's Maria up against someone at that goddamned level? Has the Association gone mad?!

Bald Marcin:
That'll be a long story... Are those kids safe?

Old Craftsman:
For the moment, can say that much. But they already got legal knighthood stripped right off them. Pfeh.

Old Knight:
Never thought I'd see things get so goddarned out of hand...

Old Knight:
Ashlock, Flametail, two other Infected knights without titles, and all the Infected they bought back from the arenas using everything they had...

Old Knight:
Fighters! And the people toying with those Infected for fun—for god's sakes, they're all children! Their oldest was only twenty! Youngest was barely—!

Bald Marcin:
......

Old Craftsman:
Even if they hid themselves in the pipelines, just one full day in city bounds and their safety'd be out the window. Not to mention the crowd we have now.

Old Knight:
I got some old friends to look after them, but the Infected are Infected, still. Wish things'd be simple as that.

Old Craftsman:
...We're not just picking a fight with the companies, now.

Old Knight:
Scared?

Old Craftsman:
Scared?! Wasn't even scared when the Ursus were holding spears to my mouth! I'm a goddamned Ursus myself!

Old Knight:
Fiddlesticks! When'd the Craftsmen ever get off those city walls?

Old Craftsman:
Huh?! Instead of running up there, you think we should've just sat in the smithy and let the catapult smash all of us flat too?

Bald Marcin:
......

Bald Marcin:
...Maria can't win this.

Old Knight:
Aye. The Maria we know facing a foe like that, just ain't no way she'll win.

Bald Marcin:
No, not that there's no way. I mean she just can't.

Bald Marcin:
Knights Association have played their hand too hard now. Add in that rotten Czarny popping up, and there's no way it can go ahead that simple.

Maria:
Nnh...!

Maria:
(My... my arm's about to dislocate... his spear—I can't get close at all—)

Maria:
(—No, even if I did, there's still no way I'd win... what do I do...?)

Left-hand Knight:
...Up.

Left-hand Knight:
Continue.

Maria:
(Grit my teeth, and get up.) Nngh...

Left-hand Knight:
On the verge of toppling? You really are the image of your 'family knighthood,' struggling for breath.

Left-hand Knight:
Up. Continue. The best way to stamp out a knight is to stamp out her dignity.

Greatmouth Mob:
He taunts! He taunts, over and over! A look of disdain and victory in one, aimed square at his opponent! 'Left-hand' Tytus will make your blood run cold!

Greatmouth Mob:
Now the prize pool's leaning completely one way, and the odds and figures are both out of control! Don't blink, but the money right now's gotta be on par with every other arena in Kazimierz combined!

Male Tourist:
Hey! Give it all you've got, Nearl! If you pull it outta the bag somehow, I'll win enough to buy a whole castle!

Female Tourist:
Are you nuts? How much money did you put on her?

Male Tourist:
—I put down even more on Left-hand! But I'm making nothing the way this is going, so I'm just hedging my bets a little!

Maria:
Hgghh... hah... hah...

Left-hand Knight:
......

Left-hand Knight:
A visionary without a vision... wants to be a knight too.

Left-hand Knight:
I won't kill you. Forfeit. The times of old will not fade for having done so. Abandon this, and you abandon only yourself.

Maria:
Are you... sympathizing with me?

Left-hand Knight:
—Correct. As you do not deserve for me to treat you as a knight.

Maria:
......

Left-hand Knight:
I've seen footage of your fights. From Szewczyk, through the race, the melee...

Left-hand Knight:
I went out of my way to observe 'the Nearl family's new knight,' and every lucky victory of yours was a personal affront to me—look at you. You had the gall to waste my time like this?

Maria:
Ughh—!

Left-hand Knight:
Stand firm, Maria Nearl. I will tell you the worlds that separate you and the Radiant Knight.

Left-hand Knight:
Her shining light could drown her opponent's will. Her sheer passion made me tremble. Her sheer talent made others envy her.

Left-hand Knight:
And you—victory against you is trivial. I will extinguish your resolve, to a pile of ash.

Greatmouth Mob:
Airtime! Tytus has once against sent Maria's weapon flying!

Greatmouth Mob:
Oh, man, this loop of devastation is too much bear, but no problem! The arena isn't just to let flesh and blood fly—it lets knights go on a rampage of pure strength!

Greatmouth Mob:
Taunting! Pressuring! Destroying! This is 'Left-hand' Tytus, mercilessly disposing of the weak!

Maria:
(So forceful...! And my shield split apart?! This is the one Margaret left!)

Maria:
(Traces of Arts on the edge of his blade—his Arts—)

Maria:
Ugh!

Left-hand Knight:
The Radiant Knight had not the Black Knight's strength, nor the Blood Knight's menace. She went against the lowest tier of the Major, and became champion by no more than a fluke—

Left-hand Knight:
—Even if I console myself so, I still know deeply the chasm that separated us. Against her, I have only pity for you, seeing your weakness.

Maria:
I might not... compare to my sister...

Maria:
But I am still—a Nearl family knight!

Left-hand Knight:
...Eyesore.

Maria:
(One flick of his hand—?!)

Left-hand Knight:
Enough! Insult me no longer with the Arts you used on Ingra!

Maria:
Ungh... ugh...

Left-hand Knight:
Do not rise again. No matter your armor's resilience, your pain must be excruciating.

Maria:
......

Left-hand Knight:
You silently raise your arm again. Your tenacity at least deserves recognition.

Zofia:
Sorry, sorry—make way, make way!

Zofia:
I can finally see her...

Zofia:
...Maria.

Maria:
......!

Left-hand Knight:
What now? You have not even the energy to speak?

Maria:
......

Left-hand Knight:
Your breaths come wild, your stance is empty... what path to victory could you even speak of?

Left-hand Knight:
What—mnph.

The noble knight, the commercial leviathan, the veteran of the Major, Tytus Topola, once more narrows his eyes—

—to the light that pierces them.
