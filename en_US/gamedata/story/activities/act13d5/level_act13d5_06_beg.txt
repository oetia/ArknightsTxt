Maria:
......

Old Knight:
You tell them to drink, but what about you? How many pints have you downed?

Old Craftsman:
Pipe down, old bones. I just gotta fire up the engine in me—

Old Craftsman:
—What's wrong, girl?

Old Craftsman:
Not looking too good there. You and Zofia haven't patched things up yet?

Maria:
I'm fine... Has Auntie been here again?

Bald Marcin:
She was pacing around right by the door, but then she left just a minute ago. She's worried about you.

Bald Marcin:
I say you go find her.

Maria:
......

Maria:
They've already decided my next opponent.

Maria:
If I can win, do you think my auntie... do you think everyone will understand me then?

Old Craftsman:
There, girl...

Old Knight:
...Things aren't that simple, Maria.

Old Craftsman:
Hey! Watch it, old boy, what're you blabbering?

Old Knight:
The reason Zofia doesn't want you in the Major's not just because she reckons you'll lose or get hurt...

Old Knight:
The competition isn't fair. See, the moment you set foot up higher, you're up against more than just your opponents...

Old Knight:
Think corps. Corps playing other corps. Families fighting other families.

Old Knight:
Not even them Adeptus watchdogs'll stick their hands in. Between the Knights Association, Grand Knight and all the directors, they make a three-way power tussle messier than you might ever imagine.

Maria:
......

Old Knight:
Course, I wouldn't tell you to give up, Maria.

Old Knight:
'Think it through, look at all the difficulties you'll face, and only then should you press on. ' When you figure that one out, go knock 'em all the hell down for us old-timers to see.

Maria:
...Mm!

Bald Marcin:
We've got a new face—

Bald Marcin:
——

Bald Marcin:
—You're not welcome here. Kindly leave.

Spokesman Czarny:
Don't be so cold, my old friend, dear Tremoriron Knight.

Spokesman Czarny:
Your sacrifice brought a chronic heat to us all. I'm greatly respectful of your disposition within the arena.

Old Knight:
Who the hell're you?

Spokesman Czarny:
...The level-2 knight, Vogelweide... the former second-order knight. Or ought I be calling you Batbayar? I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it correctly...

Old Craftsman:
Hey—

Spokesman Czarny:
Ooh, no, no, let's not bring the daggers out. I'm certainly no knight, merely an assiduous civil servant...

Bald Marcin:
Cool it! Vogelweide!

Old Knight:
...If I had my bow on hand, you wouldn't dare talk to me like that.

Spokesman Czarny:
I appear to have made a transgression. If I offended you, I deeply, profoundly apologize.

Bald Marcin:
Leave that little two-faced act by the door. What are you doing here?

Spokesman Czarny:
...I'm a mere working stiff. As is natural, I'm here to relay to Miss Maria Nearl some arrangements the Knights Association have made.

Spokesman Czarny:
Miss Maria?

Maria:
Ah... um, here...

Spokesman Czarny:
Your next opponent has been duly decided.

Bald Marcin:
No reason to come in person for this.

Spokesman Czarny:
True, but I do prefer to handle things personally. It is the only way I ensure I have an exact grasp on all manner of matters that may arise in the workflow... Of course, there's a selfish element as well.

Spokesman Czarny:
I can hardly contain my curiosity regarding the sister of the Radiant Knight Margaret Nearl. The young knight who's all the rage.

Spokesman Czarny:
There are many seeded players, hopefuls for the Major, who have hardly the popularity to match up to you, Miss Maria. It is a strength you bear as a competition knight, an advantage.

Spokesman Czarny:
I hope to see you make appropriate use of this advantage. Of course, I also possess many... high-grade business contracts.

Spokesman Czarny:
When compared to any of those sponsors who sought you out in private, I can guarantee that these are all corporate and Knightclub affiliations beyond your imagination...

Bald Marcin:
We're long sick of your sales pitch. Maria here takes things her own way.

Old Knight:
Hear, hear! You've taken all the glory out of knighthood. It's profane!

Spokesman Czarny:
Glory? Ah... right, glory.

Spokesman Czarny:
The campaign knights garrisoned the frontier fortresses at dawn, and competitors of every standing brought value regardless to Kazimierz—

Spokesman Czarny:
Glory, where is glory? Has it vanished?

Spokesman Czarny:
No.

Spokesman Czarny:
No-one can excise glory from Kazimierz. Not even if the hundreds of thousands of Kazimierz companies, big and small, were to join forces as one.

Spokesman Czarny:
So have knights been reduced to tools of war, eyes blinded by profit? Have knights abandoned glory themselves, forgotten their pasts?

Spokesman Czarny:
No and no. To say that is to look down on the knights. No director would dare entertain the lie that knights have become marionettes. For what reason would the flourishing of the competition knights bring us sorrow?

Old Knight:
*Spit*! Who are you to talk about glory?

Old Knight:
Kazimierz can't even remember what the past—

Spokesman Czarny:
—Past glory, the spirit of knighthood, ah—the great transcendental soul! The sun that beamed in history's hollows!

Spokesman Czarny:
Do I have that right? But neither spectator nor tourist need spirit, and it's hardly necessary for us to make a show of it for them.

Old Knight:
Slippery little... I could tear your face off right now.

Spokesman Czarny:
Ah, let's not be so hasty. Glory, yes, what a wonderful thing, what an impeccable thing, and still it exists upon every knight family's crest—

Spokesman Czarny:
—But, most unfortunately, the Kazimierz people no longer need it.

Spokesman Czarny:
It has not been abandoned, nor drowned beneath. It has always been here. The simple fact is people nowadays... do not need it.

Spokesman Czarny:
I can hardly even say 'abandoned' is fair, my friend. When you buy an all-new intercity net-connected digital television, and you stow away your old radio into the cupboard, do you call that 'abandoned?'

Spokesman Czarny:
Rather, it's forgotten. Not the kind that carries a spiteful meaning. It is the pure kind of forgetting, the one that results from the progress that scientific advancement and new modes of life bring.

Spokesman Czarny:
How can you denounce progress itself? My friend?

Old Knight:
Don't call me 'friend' this or 'friend' that. There's not a single friend of yours here.

Old Knight:
Finish up fast and trot on home. Maria isn't on display here.

Spokesman Czarny:
No, my friend, you are wrong once again.

Spokesman Czarny:
Of course I do not stand in front of a knight simply to demean her status. No, but every knight has the obligation to recognize her own responsibility to Kazimierz.

Spokesman Czarny:
Knights are no exhibits, but the most noble and lavish of the showcases, for all the world to gaze upon the beauty of Kazimierz! I dearly hope you can all understand this.

Sona:
Ashley... you think we went overboard this time? Hey, Ashley, come on. Did you pass out?

Ashlock Knight:
Ggh, it's so loud... shit hurts...

Sona:
Haha, yeah, I get you... but we have to keep up the pace. Want me to carry you?

Ashlock Knight:
...In hell!

Sona:
They haven't caught up with us yet... What street are we on, even?

Ashlock Knight:
There's... their breath, from the front! Turn left!

Sona:
Okay—hold on tight—!

Maria:
...When's the next match?

Spokesman Czarny:
Oh, my apologies, I'd almost forgotten what I was here for.

Spokesman Czarny:
It's three days from now, and your opponent will be the Left-hand Knight... 'Left-hand' Tytus Topola.

Bald Marcin:
......

Spokesman Czarny:
As a sidenote, Miss Maria, if you accept any of the Knightclub proposals I've put forward to you, then even supposing you have no luck in the Major—

Spokesman Czarny:
—I can still guarantee the legitimacy of your noble knighthood will remain secure.

Spokesman Czarny:
I'm sure Miss 'Whislash' Zofia, and the Radiant Knight, far away wherever she is, will both be reassured.

Maria:
...I appreciate your kindness.

Maria:
I'll make Kazimierz recognize the Nearl family. I won't let all my ancestors' efforts go to waste. I WILL prove that the Nearl family deserves its knighthood!

Spokesman Czarny:
Well, well, you'll prove... in the competition... Tell me, will you prove?

Spokesman Czarny:
Is cooperation with a corporation not the greatest proof a knight could have of her status? When you face your most ardent fans, tourists from all corners of Terra, the loyal clientele of Kazimierz, what is it that you so desperately want to tell them—

Spokesman Czarny:
—What will you prove?

Maria:
...I will prove...

Spokesman Czarny:
—Pardon?

Maria:
......

Maria:
I...

Spokesman Czarny:
I'm sorry, please wait a moment.

Spokesman Czarny:
Hello? Speaking. What? No, I'm currently... Right, I understand. Please, don't worry.

Spokesman Czarny:
Regretfully, Miss Maria, it seems I cannot wait for your answer.

Spokesman Czarny:
And to you, gentlemen, pardon the offense I've caused, and I hope you have a pleasant evening.

Old Knight:
Keh. Get outta here.

Bald Marcin:
......

Spokesman Czarny:
Well, then. Let me bid you farewell. If you ever change your mind, contact me at any time.

Bald Marcin:
......

Old Knight:
Makes me want to hurl seeing that corp slime face.

Old Craftsman:
Say, V... Why'd he know your...

Old Knight:
...I'd like to know myself. Since my grandpappy passed on, been the better half of a century since I heard a soul call my old name.

Old Knight:
And his pronunciation was a pile of shit.

Bald Marcin:
Things are getting risky. Knights Association and the corps are looking into us now. Looking into all of us.

Bald Marcin:
Someone might've already started making moves.

Maria:
......

Bald Marcin:
Don't look like that, Maria. You're not alone here. We owe a hell of a lot to your old Grandpa Nearl. We're all—

Sona:
Anyone here—!? Sorry, we got a casualty—

Maria:
...The Flametail Knight?

Sona:
Nearl...? Uh, let's make this quick—could you help us out here a bit?

Ashlock Knight:
Ugh... well, this sucks... I was looking forward to our arena matchup. Now I get to remember you as my nurse first, huh?

Maria:
B-Both of your injuries...! Come on, just come with me, quickly—

Maria:
Wait, what are you all—

Bald Marcin:
Maria, you look after the wounded. Don't need to worry about anything else.

Old Knight:
Kowal!

Old Craftsman:
Here's your bow, you old bones!

Old Knight:
Looks like they brought company.

Old Craftsman:
......

Old Knight:
......

Bald Marcin:
......

Old Knight:
...They didn't come with.

Old Craftsman:
Pfah. Who're we dealing with? Who sics themselves on competition knights in broad daylight?

Old Knight:
That kid's an Infected. Let's go see what's what. Might need more than just Maria for this.

Old Knight:
—Marcin?

Bald Marcin:
......

Bald Marcin:
...On my way.
