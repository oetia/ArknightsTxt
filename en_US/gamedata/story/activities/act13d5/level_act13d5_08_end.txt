There is an old man in the audience.

This old man has not a speck of interest in competition knights. At the behest of his beloved grandchild, he has grudgingly purchased two tickets to the event so hyped up by the newspapers and media.

He frowns, he sighs, for he does not know why the crowd cheers for the public execution of the young Kuranta by the Sarkaz.

He does not think anything is wrong, for he too was once a knight, a campaign knight without a noble title. He merely scoffs at the competition, at the Sarkaz.

Yet, the battlefield suddenly flares with a blazing light. The old man remembers that the knight is the young lady of the Nearl family.

What a pity, he laments as he stares at the dazzling light. At the same time, the very few Kazimierz present in the audience simultaneously recall an old story.

The story takes place in a land beyond rivers, forests and lakes, in a great fortress formed of towers and walls.

Every day, as night falls, blazing torches form an unbroken line. The campaign knights' armor gleams beneath the moonlight, the sharp edges of their silver lances point at the restless enemy prowling in the darkness.

The invaders are ruthless. The Leithanians, capable of coloring the sky, black out the moon. The terrible armies of Ursus overwhelm the castle walls.

Cities are captured and brought into Ursus in humiliation. The lines fall back once and again, as 'Silverlance' becomes a mocking joke leveled at the knights by the warmongers.

They are pushed to the outskirts of the last city, the last line of defense——

——Where Kazimierz makes its last stand, a pegasus with golden hair appears.

On the dawn of that day, when the Ursus suffer their first defeat of the war, on the faraway horizon of Kazimierz, two suns rise.

Light.

The light does not dissipate. Rays of light diffuse into a haze, banishing the terror.

At this moment, even the sun itself nods, welcoming the returning knight.

......

......

...Maria.

Stand up, Maria.

Maria:
......

Maria:
......Margaret?

Maria.

You've grown up. You've really done well.

Spokesman Czarny:
No... That's not Maria's Arts...

Spokesman Czarny:
What happened?

Corporate Employee:
Mr. Czarny! We just received a message from——the Armorless Union! A beam of light crashed into the arena from a kilometer away northwest!

Corporate Employee:
It was very, very fast! They couldn't even get a glimpse of what it was!

Spokesman Czarny:
...Terrorist attack?

Corporate Employee:
I-It doesn't seem like a weapon. It's a person, a Kuranta, but only the strongest knights are able to handle speed like that——

Spokesman Czarny:
......

Spokesman Czarny:
...No.

Spokesman Czarny:
Impossible... Light... Could it be...

Corrupted Knight:
Guh... Where's the enemy? Too bright, can't see...!

Withered Knight:
Mission, must be completed. No matter who——kill the target first!

Corrupted Knight:
Guh....!

Corrupted Knight:
Knocked off my feet... barehanded...? Who?

Margaret:
Foul Arts and tortured Sarkaz Infected. Is this what a 'knight' should be?

Corrupted Knight:
Gaa...

Maria:
Margaret...?

Maria:
Wait... Is it really you? I'm not hallucinating, am I...?

Margaret:
It's me.

Maria:
......

Maria:
R... Really?

Margaret:
Yes.

Maria:
......Margaret?

Margaret:
You've done well, Maria.

Maria:
*Sob*... Margaret... What... What took you so long...?

Corrupted Knight:
...Wretch! Kill them both!

Margaret:
No, don't even think about it.

Corrupted Knight:
Why... Why can't I hit her...?

Withered Knight:
...Her light is gathering and suppressing our Arts. Retreat. I will deal with her.

Greatmouth Mob:
It's her——She came in that light. It's——that's——that's the Radiant Knight!

Greatmouth Mob:
What's going on?! The exiled Radiant Knight returns at the climax of this fight!

Greatmouth Mob:
(Hey! Go get the spokesman! What the hell is going on?! What——Huh?)

Greatmouth Mob:
Sh-She broke the rules! But that's not important! To save her sister, the Radiant Knight did whatever it took to return to Kazimierz!

Greatmouth Mob:
Exceptional courage! Extraordinary demeanor! Unrelenting in the face of the two knights from hell!

Greatmouth Mob:
Let us cheer——for the Radiant Knight!

Zofia:
That's... Margaret? That knight with the shield is the Radiant Knight...?

Zofia:
W-Why did she come back to Kazimierz...?

Bald Marcin:
I don't even recognize her anymore...

Bald Marcin:
...It's her. What has she been through all these years...?

Zofia:
*Sigh*...

Bald Marcin:
The Radiant Knight, that spirited Margaret... She's returned?

Old Knight:
Huff...... Just be a dear and let us through.

Platinum:
Sorry. No can do.

Old Knight:
So we gotta put our lives on the line then, eh?

Platinum:
I'd really rather you didn't.

Platinum:
I'll say it again: there's nothing you can do. I live by a rule, I don't fight with anyone but my target.

Platinum:
As long as you stay away from the arena, you get to live——Hm?

Platinum:
——It's getting bright?

Old Craftsman:
Hey! V, look over there!

Old Knight:
What...

Old Knight:
That light... that...

Old Knight:
Old Man Nearl...?

Platinum:
(This is a lot more intense than Maria's Arts. Could it be...?)

Platinum:
(But... The two Lazurites... It can't be...)

Platinum:
Hm.

Platinum:
It's me.

???:
Time to stop playing, little pegasus. Pack up and skedaddle.

Platinum:
...What?

???:
The Radiant Knight herself is in the mix. No point to guarding the door anymore, is there?

Platinum:
......

Platinum:
I think I get the gist of it... But you still failed, even with the both of you?

???:
Don't be so suspicious of your superiors, little pegasus. The board of directors only asked us to 'watch the Radiant Knight' after all, not fight her...

???:
I was thinking that even if we did fight, I would have that dumb-faced idiot with me so it wouldn't be any problem at all.

???:
Turns out there was, uh, a tiny issue shall we say. First off, the Radiant Knight seems to have gotten just that little bit stronger... There are also some troublesome horns together with her, it's really annoying.

Platinum:
Well... If it's even giving you trouble, you're wasting your time telling me about it.

???:
Oh, I almost forgot. I wanted to tell you about it because the target is approaching your location right now——Hmm, might be too late, actually.

???:
Well, try to avoid fighting at all costs. Good luck surviving, little Platinum.

Platinum:
Sorry? Wait...

Platinum:
What the hell are they doing...

Platinum:
Could it be Młynar? No, can't be... He should still be in his office... Then...

Platinum:
Nnh...!

Platinum:
(Wh-what? Just now, was that...a blue shadow?)

Old Craftsman:
V...!

Old Knight:
I know!

Old Craftsman:
What's happening? I've never felt like this before...

Old Knight:
...Don't move. Breathe slowly and look around.

Platinum:
(Feels like I've been made... And those two are looking jumpy...)

Platinum:
Oh, here.

Old Knight:
......

Old Craftsman:
......

Platinum:
......

A white-horned Sarkaz holding a sword stops in front of them. She breathes softly, raising her eyes at them.

Shining:
......

Platinum:
......Ugh, of course they'd be difficult to handle... They're not even knights...

Shining:
......

Platinum:
Let them pass. Their names aren't on the list anyway.

Shining:
...Thank you.

Shining:
Liz, can you still move?

Nightingale:
Yes... It's bright over there.

Shining:
It's Nearl.

Nightingale:
Let us go then?

Shining:
Yes.

Platinum:
...Really, what's going on today...

Old Knight:
That Sarkaz just now... Does she know Margaret? What's happening?

Old Craftsman:
It's really Margaret! V! Margaret's back!

Old Knight:
...Don't yell.

Old Knight:
Then... What about us? Do we keep going?

Platinum:
Don't stare at me like that... You get to live.

Old Knight:
......

Platinum:
They cancelled the mission. I don't have a reason to stop you anymore.

Platinum:
You get to live.

Old Knight:
You gonna leave, just like that? Halt!

Old Craftsman:
V! Don't bother with them, let's get to the arena!

Old Knight:
Tch...damned Armorless Union.

Spokesman Czarny:
Margaret Nearl... The Radiant Knight!

Spokesman Czarny:
Where's the arena security?

Corporate Employee:
S-Security...? That was the Radiant Knight charging at full power, we'd probably have to raise the city's barrier to stop her...

Spokesman Czarny:
......

Spokesman Czarny:
Radiant Knight...

Spokesman Czarny:
Haha... Radiant Knight... With things as they are now, why did you even return? To look at the knights' epitaph?

Corporate Employee:
Mr. Czarny! We've received word from the General Chamber of Commerce... You...

Spokesman Czarny:
......

Spokesman Czarny:
Mr. Malkiewicz.

Corporate Employee:
Yes?

Spokesman Czarny:
No matter what happens next, even if I don't return, you must not leave this room.

Corporate Employee:
O-Okay...

Spokesman Czarny:
Yes, I've already prepared everything beforehand... Yes, Czarny, you have already done everything you could, so just wait for the curtain call.

Spokesman Czarny:
How amusing... Pfft, hahaha...

Corporate Employee:
Sir...?

Spokesman Czarny:
Ah, excuse me...

Spokesman Czarny:
......

Corporate Employee:
Mr. Czarny? Your phone...?

Spokesman Czarny:
...I know, I know.

Spokesman Czarny:
Please excuse me... for a moment.

Margaret:
...Knight techniques.

Margaret:
But drug overdose and signs of overreliance on Arts. Also...

Corrupted Knight:
Guh——

Withered Knight:
I will suppress her! Kill the target!

The mentally crippled Sarkaz warrior brandishes his weapon, Arts and the smell of a grave.

But the Radiant Knight does not move.

Withered Knight:
——Kill her!

Margaret:
Hmm, the explosive energy has been dissipated——

Corrupted Knight:
——Die!

Maria:
——

Corrupted Knight:
Guh....! You...still have strength?!

Margaret:
Maria, your wounds——

Maria:
Margaret! You once said a knight raises her shield to protect others... right?

Maria:
But, now, on this battlefield——

Maria:
——There is no one that you need to protect!

Margaret:
......!

Maria:
I will become your shield, so——

Withered Knight:
Move aside, I will blast them both to death!

Maria:
——I'll do my best!

Corrupted Knight:
Guh... She abandoned her shield! But your Arts!

Withered Knight:
...This, impossible... That warhammer is her staff, she...

Margaret:
Are you ready, Maria?

Maria:
Yes!

Margaret:
To be a knight...

Maria:
Is to be the noble light that illuminates the land!

Greatmouth Mob:
The Radiant Knight who charged onto the field has abandoned her shield after just a few short exchanges! Hold on! Wait!

Greatmouth Mob:
Remember the two-handed warhammer craze that followed the Radiant Knight?! Watch her swing that hammer, her shield long forgotten! This is the old school Radiant Knight!

Greatmouth Mob:
She's out there, against all odds! The return of the legend! The National Council could drag her away right after this match. This could be our only chance to witness the glory of the Radiant Knight!

Left-hand Knight:
This... these Arts, this glow...

Left-hand Knight:
Why are you allowed to give off that kind of light so impassively...? You arrogant little——Do you really think yourself the sun?! Radiant Knight!

Shining:
How long has it been since we saw Margaret put her shield down?

Nightingale:
Her light... It's hot.

Nightingale:
She will be fine, right?

Shining:
I've never seen her fail, after looking like that.

Nightingale:
The girl is a lot like Nearl.

Shining:
Yes, that's her sister.

Shining:
Hehe... What a cute little knight. I can see the resemblance.

Withered Knight:
...Arrows... ran out!

Corrupted Knight:
Gaa——! Your Arts!

Maria:
He's forming arrows using his Arts... I'll block them!

Margaret:
Leave the rest to me.

Withered Knight:
Can't penetrate——this damned light!

Zofia:
......

Bald Marcin:
...The audience is quiet.

Bald Marcin:
Margaret doesn't have an advantage. Those two Sarkaz are strong... and work well together.

Zofia:
But I don't feel like Margaret will lose... I don't even think she is disadvantaged...

Bald Marcin:
Her techniques are mesmerizing... Her demeanor is so calm, yet her light burns so brightly...

Bald Marcin:
It reminds me of Old Nearl, when he was young.

Greatmouth Mob:
Un-unbelievable! Totally unbelievable!

Greatmouth Mob:
The radiance from every swing of Margaret's warhammer completely dispels her opponent's Arts! Even the cracks the Radiant Knight steps on are filled with light!

Greatmouth Mob:
What amazingly brilliant Arts! Combat techniques of this level!

Greatmouth Mob:
This is definitely befitting of a champion! The true strength of a knight——!

Maria:
Haa... My wounds aren't hurting as much anymore... Is this Margaret's Arts too?

Maria:
(Caring about me even during a battle like this——)

Corrupted Knight:
Gaa——! My hammer...!

Corrupted Knight:
No weapon, then, with my hands, I'll tear you apart——!

Withered Knight:
Kill her!

Margaret:
......

Margaret has a strange expression on her face. It's...pity?

For these two Sarkaz? Because they are called knights? Or is it... because of their circumstances?

Margaret:
...Maria.

Maria:
Ah, I'm here!

Margaret:
I'll leave the support to you.

Maria:
——Yes!

Corrupted Knight:
Do it!

Withered Knight:
Yes!

Margaret:
Repent.

Corrupted Knight & Withered Knight:
——

Margaret:
——

At this moment, the entire arena descends into silence.

No one has realized that the match has ended. There aren't any knights boasting about their victory, nor are there the defiant howls of the losers.

The corrupted Sarkaz kneel on the ground——They have not fallen over, and the Radiant Knight does not strike.

She looks down upon the two Sarkaz, then takes a knee and extends her hand.

Corrupted Knight:
......

There is no reply from the Sarkaz.

Margaret:
You should not give up on your destiny.

Corrupted Knight:
No...

Corrupted Knight:
......

As if unwilling to bow to the two young girls, they remain silent, unable to stand.

The Radiant Knight turns.

Margaret:
Maria.

Maria:
Eh? What...?

Margaret:
We've won.

Greatmouth Mob:
This is unbelievable! Can you believe your eyes?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Because I sure can't! The Radiant Knight who suddenly entered the fight! The Knights Association that let it happen! Oh my god, I, this——

Greatmouth Mob:
I've never seen a situation like this in all my years of commentating! Though I don't know how the National Council will react, it doesn't change the fact that they won!

Greatmouth Mob:
I——

Spokesman Czarny:
(Mr. Mob.)

Greatmouth Mob:
(...Oh, you're here!)

Greatmouth Mob:
I am deeply honored to announce to everyone!

Greatmouth Mob:
(Mr. Spokesman, what should I do?)

Spokesman Czarny:
(Acknowledge her.)

Greatmouth Mob:
The winner is! The young and miraculous Maria! Aaaand, she who has returned from her long exile, the pegasus that everyone knows, the Radiant Knight! Margareeeeeeeeet Neaaaaaaaaarl!

Spokesman Czarny:
(That's right, Mr. Mob. I really do appreciate your ability to fan the fervor of the audience.)

Spokesman Czarny:
(Hold the fort for a while, someone will come to handle this.)

Greatmouth Mob:
Cheer for her——!

Zofia:
——

Bald Marcin:
Zofia?! Where are you going?

Old Craftsman:
Marcin! Where are they——Ugh, that, that one?

Old Knight:
Is it really Margaret... Why'd Margaret come back now?

Old Knight:
N-no matter what, she's an exile. Why didn't she tell us——

Bald Marcin:
Alright, both of you calm down. Młynar might have known about this... But for now, we need to leave.

Bald Marcin:
The reporters and the crowd are going to swarm this place. We have to find a way——to get the Radiant Knight home.

Tourist:
Radiant Knight! That's the Radiant Knight from last season!

Tourist:
Make way, make way! Let me get a picture!

Greatmouth Mob:
Everyone! Everybody! Please remain calm! No matter what happened, we have to make sure that the competition adheres to the proper procedures all the way up to the end!

Greatmouth Mob:
(What should I do next?! You can't contact the spokesman?! Idiot! Go look for him at the VIP seats——!)

Greatmouth Mob:
Hold on! That, that's the Whislash Knight! The Whislash Knight suddenly rushed towards the Radiant Knight from the crowd——

Margaret:
Zof——

Maria:
Eh——A-Aunt Zofia?!

Zofia:
You... Why are you back?!

Greatmouth Mob:
——D-did she just slap the Radiant Knight? Huh? Eh? This looks like it'll be in the papers tomorrow——

Margaret:
I'm sorry. But I've returned.

Zofia:
...That slap was for Maria.

Maria:
——?!

Zofia:
I'll spare you my own.

Margaret:
Thanks for sparing me... But, you used your right hand just now... When did that happen?

Zofia:
...Now isn't the time to talk about that. The National Council will definitely not allow an exile to return to Kazimierz.

Zofia:
We have to leave before the reporters and the National Council show up.

Maria:
R-right now? But the competition results haven't...

Zofia:
It doesn't matter! She's here and that's way more important than the competition!

Nightingale:
Nearl.

Margaret:
Careful, Liz!

Margaret:
...You don't need to worry so much. Alright, hold my hand tight.

Zofia:
These two Sarkaz...

Margaret:
Don't worry, they're my friends. Shining, can you do me a favor?

Shining:
Yes.

Corrupted Knight:
......!

Corrupted Knight:
I... I fainted... These are healing Arts?

Corrupted Knight:
Who... you?!

Corrupted Knight:
Sarkaz, you... you! It can't be, you? Healed me?

Shining:
Your injuries are very serious, but they are not from this match. The scars of drug usage may never be removed. You should take better care of yourselves.

Corrupted Knight:
Go away——Don't touch me! Guh...

Corrupted Knight:
I...

Corrupted Knight:
Wait... You...you are...

Shining:
——Nearl.

Margaret:
Yeah, I know.

Margaret:
Those two assassins from the Armorless Union are still watching us... Now is not the time to celebrate.

Zofia:
A-Armorless Union? You——

Nightingale:
Time to run? Nearl?

Margaret:
——No.

Margaret:
A victorious knight has no reason to scurry away like a coward. If they wish to stop us, just let them try.

Nightingale:
Nearl, over there.

Margaret:
Ah... It's Mr. Kowal and Mr. Vogelweide. Have they found something?

Zofia:
What do you think?! Of course they're preparing a way for you to escape!

Zofia:
The three of us will help keep the crowds away from you, but the National Council will definitely be paying you a visit. You'll have to deal with them yourself——

Zofia:
——Margaret!

Margaret:
Yeah?

Zofia:
It's really great... that you came back.

Zofia:
The usual place, don't be late.

Margaret:
Of course.

Nightingale:
That's... Nearl's family?

Shining:
She's come back home. We can all see her joy, no?

Shining:
So, let's give her some space. She's the Radiant Knight after all. No one in Kazimierz can touch her.

Nightingale:
Right.

Shining:
We'll regroup with Amiya later.

Margaret raises her head.

She used to hate this land with every fiber of her being.

Margaret:
...Maria.

Maria:
Ah, yes?

Margaret:
...Let's go home.

But this is her home.

Spokesman Czarny:
......

Platinum:
...You're here. What about your little follower?

Spokesman Czarny:
...He's the next one.

Platinum:
Ah... How cruel.

Spokesman Czarny:
Just tell me the answer.

Platinum:
Well, aren't you straightforward...? You already know the answer, why ask me?

Spokesman Czarny:
......

Platinum:
Maybe you can live better.

Spokesman Czarny:
No... Maybe I will die on the way to my exile. Maybe you will be the one to do it.

Platinum:
...Maybe. Don't blame me, if I am.

Spokesman Czarny:
Of course.

Platinum:
It won't happen through the National Council. You'll have to leave by tonight. Is there anything you need to take care of?

Spokesman Czarny:
......

Spokesman Czarny:
Szewczyk has a young son. He was present during the incident.

Platinum:
Right.

Spokesman Czarny:
I wish to ask you...

Spokesman Czarny:
...To make sure that he never has a chance to speak the truth.
