Corporate Employee:
Mr. Czarny, there're too many calls coming from the various departments, we can't handle them all!

Spokesman Czarny:
Just think of something. Try to make those still sane understand that 'victory' and 'value' are not equal.

Corporate Employee:
O-okay!

Spokesman Czarny:
*Sigh*...

Spokesman Czarny:
...Sir 'Left-hand', do you really not require further medical examination?

Left-hand Knight:
No. Being able to knock me unconscious right when I was casting my Arts is already the limit of her ability. She's still far from being able to seriously injure me.

Spokesman Czarny:
Pardon my bluntness, but the results of this match were a shock to many.

Left-hand Knight:
Hmph...

Left-hand Knight:
Even without an insignificant victory in this match, I will still bring the entirety of the Blade Helmet Knightclub into the Major with me. Worry not, spokesman.

Spokesman Czarny:
You're very confident, good.

Spokesman Czarny:
If you had gone all out, Maria Nearl would have stood no chance of victory. I hope that you will be able to deal with the fallout of this unexpected loss...

Left-hand Knight:
I will not make excuses for myself.

Spokesman Czarny:
You may end up losing opportunities from some major sponsors. Perhaps your Knightclub can——

Left-hand Knight:
——If those people are only able to see the most superficial wins and losses and cannot understand how to manage their interests, then they are not fit to work with me.

Spokesman Czarny:
You're right.

Spokesman Czarny:
Hype is the basis of profit. The customers have only ever cared about what they can see. In other words, they are only trying to get some sensory stimulation... without being aware of it themselves.

Spokesman Czarny:
However, I never expected that Sir Tytus Topola himself would place such a clear price on his own 'failure'...

Left-hand Knight:
Spokesman, do not attempt to provoke me.

Spokesman Czarny:
Yes, yes, my apologies......We will leave as soon as we are done handling all those troublesome matters.

Spokesman Czarny:
Let us meet again at the Major, Sir 'Left-hand'.

Maria:
So that's it... Sona and them were doing such things...

Zofia:
The Infected fighters' arena. I'd heard of this competition format... No, this cannot even be considered a 'format'.

Zofia:
Whether or not they come from a knight family, anyone can become a competition knight, earn the recognition of the Knights Association through their grit and become a noble...

Zofia:
But the Infected...

Old Knight:
They'll let the Infected join the competitions, but there's no country that would let an Infected become a pillar of society. That's why they're segregated in another competition format.

Old Knight:
The Infected can earn money and live on, but they'll forever be simple gladiators trying to entertain the masses... Tch. There ain't any meaning to such a sideshow.

Old Knight:
Oh, I don't mean anything by that.

Old Craftsman:
You old geezer, can't you be more tactful with your words?

Old Knight:
Who in hell am I supposed to be tactful for, huh? They're almost onto us!

Zofia:
The Infected matter is worrying, but... now is not the time to be worrying about them.

Maria:
...Yeah.

Maria:
They changed their fate as Infected through their own tenacity... But they've saved many people.

Maria:
If we want to change anything, we will have to continue moving forward.

Old Knight:
...Little Maria has become a respectable knight capable of such words... If only Margaret could see this, surely she would be gratified...

Old Craftsman:
Don't speak of the Radiant Knight like she's dead, you idiot!

Old Knight:
You're the one twisting my words, Kowal!

Maria:
......

Zofia:
Maria? What's wrong?

Maria:
N-Nothing!

Platinum:
The Champion's Wall... What a lousy place for conversation.

Platinum:
...Pictures of all the old champions, huh. This Black Knight alone has three spots.

Platinum:
Even though she dominated the Major for so many years, she doesn't seem to have aged a day... Eh, why do I feel like she looks younger than me...?

Spokesman Czarny:
Miss must be kidding.

Platinum:
Is that just good genes? How nice. How enviable.

Spokesman Czarny:
The Black Knight surely left an impressive mark on the history of knight sports. No one could have ever guessed that a Leithanian completely incapable of using Arts would ever become the 'Black Knight' we know today.

Spokesman Czarny:
Her era is long gone, however... She herself has left Kazimierz.

Platinum:
I wouldn't expect you to let go of a cash cow like that.

Spokesman Czarny:
...A dominating champion would indeed invite many worshippers, but it is very much a detriment to the development of the industry as a whole, in the long run...

Spokesman Czarny:
In short, it's exciting to see new challengers attempting to defeat the Black Knight, but after she managed to hold her own for three entire seasons... It started to get boring.

Spokesman Czarny:
The Black Knight's prospects near the end of her career weren't very good. The number of people who wanted to get rid of her one way or another could fill an entire arena.

Spokesman Czarny:
Her luck was pretty good, though. Just as she was being cornered, she met a VIP from Kjerag.

Spokesman Czarny:
She got a reasonable price... that satisfied everyone.

Spokesman Czarny:
Being able to support a good turnover is also a sign of a well-developed industry.

Platinum:
...And then there's this, an empty space.

Platinum:
The Radiant Knight?

Spokesman Czarny:
Yes. I don't think I need to elaborate.

Platinum:
I know this one. From last season, the Blood Knight.

Spokesman Czarny:
The Blood Knight's terror and might are unprecedented in the arena. Thankfully, he's rather astute and hasn't caused much trouble for us.

Platinum:
You should tell him to take it easy on the drugs from time to time. Knights are the most important assets, right?

Spokesman Czarny:
I will take that to heart, Miss.

Platinum:
...Well? I don't suppose the spokesman of the General Chamber of Commerce invited me here for a history lesson?

Spokesman Czarny:
Sorry to trouble you. The Champion's Wall will be open to the public during the Major, so I have to do a check beforehand.

Spokesman Czarny:
Of course, this is also one of the few places where I can speak without interruption.

Platinum:
Hm... Alright. It's about another job, isn't it? I can't get away anyway, so I might as well listen.

Spokesman Czarny:
It's not just about a job... I wonder if you know what the two Lazurites are doing today?

Platinum:
You're not cleared to know. And neither am I.

Spokesman Czarny:
I've heard some interesting rumors on the grapevine...

Spokesman Czarny:
What sort of major incident could've happened, that would need both Lazurites moving out in force?

Platinum:
——Ahh la la, I didn't hear anything. Nothing at all.

Spokesman Czarny:
Miss.

Platinum:
......

Spokesman Czarny:
I've checked all the requests from the other directors. There isn't a single 'major incident' that would require a Lazurite, let alone both of them.

Platinum:
You don't have worry about that. Just know it's an order from the General Chamber of Commerce.

Spokesman Czarny:
Is that so...? I can rest assured then.

Platinum:
...You really don't trust me, huh.

Spokesman Czarny:
Why do you say so, Miss?

Platinum:
You know very well that asking me stuff about my bosses is a waste of time. Are you trying to give a warning to this 'immature Platinum'? Alright, alright, message received.

Spokesman Czarny:
You're very smart. However, my suspicions are also very valid. Even if the upper echelons are hiding things from me, I must perform my duties to perfection.

Spokesman Czarny:
Yes. If you can, please instruct a subordinate of yours to help keep track of someone.

Platinum:
Who?

Czarny glances at the empty spot on the wall next to him.

Spokesman Czarny:
Młynar Nearl.

Spokesman Czarny:
Even though I think that he'll remain a useless piece of trash till the end, we must ensure that he does not affect our future plans.

Spokesman Czarny:
As for you, Miss, you must personally ensure that this carries on smoothly——

Maria:
Ouch——! P-please be more gentle...

Zofia:
Bear with it! This ointment is really expensive!

Zofia:
It's my fault for not teaching you this. Being able to properly manage your injuries during a competition is also important. Lift up your hair.

Maria:
Actually, I didn't expect that it would——Ah, ouch!

Zofia:
Going up against Ingra and then Topola, you should count your lucky stars that all four limbs are intact and you haven't suffered any major injuries...

Zofia:
Alright, put your clothes on.

Zofia:
Don't move for a few days and just stay still. Ending up with a stubborn old wound is one of the worst dangers of being a knight. Don't be like me.

Maria:
Thank you, Auntie... err Zofia.

Zofia:
......

Zofia:
Maria, that combat style... How did you come up with it?

Maria:
Rather than a combat style... Err, I was forced into it, actually...

Maria:
At the time, my only thoughts were 'Just hold on. There must be something I can do'——

Maria:
Ouch!

Zofia:
Don't put yourself through hell for such a stupid reason! The accumulated fatigue will just make your next battles harder!

Maria:
Sorry!

Zofia:
*Sigh*... Luckily you were able to take advantage of the carelessness of that 'Left-hand.' If that sadistic pervert didn't underestimate you... then you'd be in trouble.

Maria:
Eh, have you fought him before?

Zofia:
His first match after officially joining the Blade Helmet Knightclub was against me.

Maria:
O-Oh...

Maria:
...What happened?

Zofia:
That's why he refuses to talk to anyone about his debut battle.

Zofia:
It's all in the past, though... There is always a winner and loser in knight sports... He doesn't care about me.

Maria:
...Mr. Tytus seemed to recognize Margaret.

Zofia:
Yep. The three members of Blade Helmet Knightclub, including him, tried to encircle Margaret during the melee, but ended up getting annihilated instead. Who would accept such an outrageous thing?

Maria:
I-Is Margaret so merciless?

Zofia:
Margaret was very young back then.

Maria:
...What was she thinking?

Zofia:
What do you mean?

Maria:
I remember that she hated knight sports more than anything, right? There was a time when I even thought that she was just like Uncle Młynar...

Maria:
But in the end, she still went and became a competition knight, and even became the Radiant Knight...

Zofia:
...I don't know what she was thinking either. But she should be more aware than most what the knight sports represent.

Zofia:
Even so, she still went, and climbed to the peak.

Zofia:
At the very least, there were quite a few people who fervently admired Margaret and were inspired by her to become knights, including me.

Maria:
Ehehe...To be honest, that was part of the reason for me too...

Zofia:
Who knows, maybe the reason she became the champion was to get a few more Zofias and Marias.

Maria:
Is that it?

Zofia:
I don't know either.

Maria:
I wonder if she's living well, at that Rhodes Island place...

Maria:
Ahh—!

Zofia:
Wh-What? Don't surprise me like that...

Maria:
Th-There's a notch on my blade...

Zofia:
Ugh... You haven't been able to properly maintain your weapons, so it's not surprising that it ended up like this.

Zofia:
Can you deal with it yourself?

Maria:
*Sigh* Maybe, if I could borrow Master Kowal's workshop...

Old Knight:
......

Old Craftsman:
What's up, V? Focus on driving. Don't make me get out and call a taxi.

Old Knight:
I'm just thinking about those two squirrels... If you get out now I swear I'll run you over.

Old Craftsman:
...Those Infected, huh.

Old Knight:
That day we almost got into a fight. Those people outside... could they have been?

Old Craftsman:
Most likely.

Old Knight:
Have they set their sights on Maria as well? Why?

Old Craftsman:
...You're overthinking it.

Old Knight:
......

Old Craftsman:
......

Old Knight:
Is it gonna rain the day after tomorrow?

Old Craftsman:
Cloudy.
