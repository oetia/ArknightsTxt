Spokesman Czarny:
The previous Platinum harbored a secret love for his target, and so for the sake of protecting the object of his affections, he died at the Armorless Union's hands.

Spokesman Czarny:
As a result, the girl of today was pushed hastily into the position, our 'youngest Platinum.'

Spokesman Czarny:
...She is a gifted mark, make no joke, and I must say her strong potential makes her unignorably suited for the role... but in all other respects, she is far and away one of the least mature to ever assume the position.

Corporate Employee:
I-I see... Why are you telling me this? The Armorless Union's existence should be classified... so aren't you...

Spokesman Czarny:
Oh, do lay your concerns aside. It's simply been on my mind quite a bit as of late. Had I not made the effort to get to where I am today, I would hardly enjoy the privilege to ponder it.

Spokesman Czarny:
Did you know? Our present Platinum was elected to the position by the very Platinum before her, doomed to die as he was.

Spokesman Czarny:
A great deal of food for thought... Not to mention why the Armorless Union would listen to a traitor, to say nothing of how electing this girl would have absolutely no impact on his own death sentence. For what reason did he do this?

Spokesman Czarny:
Before the arrow of his own colleague shot through his chest, did he think to cry out? To whom? Of what? To what end? Would it have been that easy?

Corporate Employee:
......

Spokesman Czarny:
If I remember correctly, you a Słoma employee, correct?

Corporate Employee:
Y-Yeah... so far in the event, I've been responsible for liaising between the major companies and the Knights Association...

Spokesman Czarny:
Errand work takes quite the toll.

Corporate Employee:
It's no problem. If I can contribute to the business, that's what I'm here for—

Spokesman Czarny:
No no no, your work is what they pay your salary for. You needn't use such humble language.

Spokesman Czarny:
You apparently had your own business before. What made you abandon it?

Corporate Employee:
Ah... I didn't have what it took...

Spokesman Czarny:
What distinguishes failure and success may be more than ability. Perhaps you have chosen the wrong path to walk, or perhaps you walk as I do now.

Corporate Employee:
P-People like me only...

Spokesman Czarny:
In Kazimierz, anything is possible.

Zofia:
......

Bald Marcin:
Zofia... feels like an age since I saw you.

Zofia:
Oh, Marcin...

Zofia:
...Have you seen Maria?

Bald Marcin:
Something cropped up. Had her head back home.

Zofia:
I see—

Zofia:
—I smell blood. Hold on. What are these bandages?

Zofia:
Has Maria been hurt? Who was she fighting? What happened?!

Zofia:
I told her not to be rash! Why doesn't this silly girl—

Bald Marcin:
Steady, now. It's some other kid who got hurt.

Zofia:
...What happened?

Bald Marcin:
Someone went for the Ashlock and Flametail Knights out of nowhere... Ashlock got injured, and by a mighty stroke of something, they ended up in here.

Bald Marcin:
This morning, they said they didn't want to cause Nearl any more trouble and left.

Zofia:
...Do things like that just happen?

Bald Marcin:
They're in a hell of a tight spot, but our hands are tied.

Bald Marcin:
Seen the news this morning?

Zofia:
......

Zofia:
What's Maria doing now?

Bald Marcin:
Competing.

Zofia:
Competing in what? Against who?

Bald Marcin:
Unguarded one-on-one, just like with Ingra. Head to head.

Bald Marcin:
Against 'Left-hand' Tytus Topola.

Zofia:
Hold on—who?

Bald Marcin:
Blade Helmet Knightclub commander. Noble knight, big commercial name, been as far as the Final 16. Tytus Topola.

Zofia:
But... But there should be no way Maria gets matched against him at her point level, and his social standing is...

Bald Marcin:
Someone came looking for Maria. It wasn't good.

Bald Marcin:
She's just like Margaret used to be. Obsessed with charging forward, no idea how to deal with the corporates.

Zofia:
You think... she's like Margaret?

Zofia:
Margaret KNEW what she was doing. Maria only got like this after falling for her own wishful thinking about her own ideals.

Zofia:
She's not even clear what's in front of her, and she doesn't know what to do about it. She can't keep pushing upwards like this!

Zofia:
Maria was so much more carefree before this... She doesn't need to be the kind of knight you and I were, does she?

Bald Marcin:
You might be right, but you need to remember she's got her own mind for things. You can't decide it all for her.

Bald Marcin:
She's still real young, and uneasy at that. Maybe her being carefree was all just so she wouldn't worry you.

Zofia:
......

Bald Marcin:
Maria might not come off mature a lot of the time, but what kind of kid without a fighting spirit could overcome the Plastic Knight, come to a draw with Brassrust, hold third place in a melee?

Zofia:
Maybe she ought to lose a match. It'd sober her up.

Bald Marcin:
If you're telling me that's what you really think.

Zofia:
......

Zofia:
...Which arena is it?

Greatmouth Mob:
Ladiiiiiiies—aaaand gentlemeeeenn! Welcommme, to the Fireblade Arena, and welcome to a very special event today!

Greatmouth Mob:
An event already drawing the greatest media attention since the start of the preliminaries! Right at this verrry moment, all twelve imprints of the Rose Paper Union are zeroed in on one arena!

Greatmouth Mob:
And not just that—whoa, put your hands together now for the Fireblade Arena, the third largest in Kazimierz! Because today! Every single seat has been filled!

Greatmouth Mob:
Are our opponents today just that popular?! Or is this going to be one seriously major show?!

Greatmouth Mob:
It's my job to tell you the answer is—booooth!

Greatmouth Mob:
And I gotta say—what a privilege!

Greatmouth Mob:
In today's special event! Our first competitor, hailing from the Nearl family, the mania for her's off the charts! The marvelous maiden knight who's got all her fans talking—Maria Nearl!

Greatmouth Mob:
And facing her—! The concealed blade, the height of status, named for the old knight of legend, it's the headliner of the Blade Helmet Knightclub, it's 'Left-hand' Tytus Topola!

Greatmouth Mob:
Ooooh, man! Might be a first, today—the knights haven't even come in yet, but the prize pool is running insane numbers! Looks like I oughta stop running my mouth already—I bet y'all wanted me to stop, right?

Greatmouth Mob:
I got you! No time to lose! Would our two knights please enter the arena!

Maria:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
First on the battlefield is Maria Nearl! Just like always, pure white armor! Just like always, a delicate stance!

Greatmouth Mob:
After defeating 'Plastic' Szewczyk, she's been marching victorious! Big or small, no matter the event, Maria Nearl brings her A-game!

Greatmouth Mob:
Standing here now, she declared way back she had to get a place in the Major! Can she use this match as a stepping stone, and rise to the apex of the Kazimierz knights? We're all waiting to see!

Maria:
(I never did that...)

Greatmouth Mob:
And in the other corner—please—

Left-hand Knight:
Shut up, motormouthed clown.

Left-hand Knight:
Your sort don't deserve to stand in my arena. Get off the stage. Get out.

Greatmouth Mob:
—No mistake! That's Tytus Topola! I've been saying forever, we oughta give all our contestants microphones and let the audience immerse themselves in the heat of battle!

Greatmouth Mob:
This event is joint sponsored by Mieszko Group, Rose Paper Union, Słoma Food Company and the Roar Guards!

Greatmouth Mob:
The entire audience will get product coupons for goods from the aforementioned companies at any time! And once again, I'm gonna personally recommend a must-have for all you watching the game—Blue Ear Beer!

Left-hand Knight:
...Nearl.

Left-hand Knight:
Ugly sight. Struggling to hold onto your family's knighthood. Like a gloompincer out of water.

Left-hand Knight:
With no strength to bear a knight's name, what service will shamelessly lashing out do?

Maria:
...Your words mean nothing to me.

Left-hand Knight:
So they shall. May the last Nearl knight be ruined by my own hand today.

Left-hand Knight:
Fear not. I'm a different breed from Ingra's dross... You will know today that not all who bear weapons can be called knights.

Greatmouth Mob:
I smell gunpowder! Primed and ready to blow—!

Greatmouth Mob:
I'm done holding you back, so may I have the honor to declare! Let the match—beginnnn!

Maria:
——

Left-hand Knight:
Hmph.

Greatmouth Mob:
—Wh-What just happened?! It was instant! The instant it started! Maria's sword got sent flying! And one swift follow-up kick—!

Greatmouth Mob:
This is a HUGE power imbalance, alright—!

Left-hand Knight:
Pick up your sword.

Maria:
(It-It hurts...! How does he...!)

Left-hand Knight:
Faster.

Maria:
......

Maria:
(The ułan... extended attack range, and agile, and powerful... and leaves no gaps.)

Maria:
...Again.

Left-hand Knight:
Good.

Maria:
You won't have it your way—!

Left-hand Knight:
Frail.

Maria:
Nnfh—!

Maria:
Cleaving... the light?

Left-hand Knight:
...Is that so hard?

Left-hand Knight:
I was thinking I'd rend your sword straight in two, hmph... the Nearl family sword.

Left-hand Knight:
You hold shakily to your faith, but you know nothing true of faith. You are naive—weak—feeble-minded—

Left-hand Knight:
Unworthy to stand before me.

Greatmouth Mob:
And again! The Left-hand Knight makes it look easy! He waits for Maria to pick up her weapon, and then deals the next blow!

Greatmouth Mob:
This is the power of Kazimierz's first-class Knightclub! This is the power of a true Major knight! Pals in the audience here for the first time, don't close your eyes, don't miss a thing!

Greatmouth Mob:
'Cause this brutal battle'll end in a flash!

Maria:
Ungh—!

The light—crumbled, ruined, desecrated.

In the shadow of 'Left-hand' Tytus, Maria raises her sword once more.
