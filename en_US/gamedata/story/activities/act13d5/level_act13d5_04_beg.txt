3:49 P.M. \ Clear \ Kazimierz Kawalerielki Alliance, a private open-air loft

???:
...I see you've arrived, Mr. Mob.

Greatmouth Mob:
Wait. It's you. I saw you back at the arena and you said—

???:
No. That's neither here nor there. Now, don't be so wound up. Take a seat.

???:
Allow me to introduce myself again—please, call me Czarny. I'm one of the rotational managers, currently responsible for a division of the Knights Association.

Spokesman Czarny:
I'm also an executive of the Mieszko Group Major & Publicity Department, and have had the great fortune to be selected as Divisional Spokesman to the General Chamber of Commerce.

Greatmouth Mob:
Th—The G.C.C.? Pardon me for my incredible rudeness earlier, Mr. Czarny...

Spokesman Czarny:
Forego the formality. I'm no critic of your... vernacular, 'Greatmouth Mob.' Or, perhaps, I should be calling you by your real name?

Greatmouth Mob:
N-No need...

Spokesman Czarny:
Haha, I only jest... Now, why don't we take a look outside. Glorious view, isn't it?

Spokesman Czarny:
There are some old types that hate this reinforced concrete jungle, the city of seamless day and night. But if you ask me, it is what symbolizes our strides towards civilization.

Spokesman Czarny:
Our vast forests, grassland expanses, are a priceless part of Kazimierz, true, but our hardy Kazimierz hands built up great skyscrapers where the forests parted. It's something we ought to be proud of.

Spokesman Czarny:
It is the only way we find shelter when a Catastrophe strikes, the only way form a front that can stand firm against our foreign enemies. Kazimierz is now prosperous, a rapidly developing place...

Spokesman Czarny:
Would you agree? Mr. Mob?

Greatmouth Mob:
Course! You're right on the mark!

Spokesman Czarny:
But Kazimierz's strides are far from over. The road we have to walk is still long.

Spokesman Czarny:
For example... Mr. Mob, take your hometown, our 'City of Saplings and Artisans,' Ognisko.

Spokesman Czarny:
In the thousand miles around it, how many deprived villages lie? How many troubled lands unafforded the protection of a city?

Greatmouth Mob:
Y-You really know your stuff, for sure. I was outta there, like, twenty-plus years ago.  Can I, uh, ask why you're telling me all this, though?  Truth is, you're kinda bugging me out here...

Spokesman Czarny:
Your frankness is another part of what draws me to you. I've come to make you an offer, Mr. Mob. One that will take us in joint strides. You've been poached.

Greatmouth Mob:
...Me? But I just took a down from the Roar Guards Company...

Spokesman Czarny:
Please, relax. This contract is confidential, sealed by none other than Mr. Pavel himself. Now, from today on, your employer will be...

Greatmouth Mob:
S-So I'm a Mieszko guy now?

Spokesman Czarny:
You could put it that way... but let me nitpick it very slightly.

Greatmouth Mob:
Yeah?

Spokesman Czarny:
From now on, you're MY guy, Mr. Anchorman.

Maria:
Hiyaaaaaah—!

Zofia:
...Let's stop here for today.

Maria:
Huh? But I can still...

Zofia:
Overdoing it will undo you! You only just finished recovering. We're all sturdy Kuranta, but no-one torments her body like do!

Maria:
Alright...

Maria:
—Could you help me brainstorm about those Arts I mentioned, then, auntie?

Zofia:
...Didn't we already go over this yesterday?

Maria:
I watched this tape of Leithanian Knights battling last night, and I think I could pull from some parts of it to—

Zofia:
Last night?

Maria:
Ah...

Zofia:
So you were up late again! I've said before, you need to get your rest!

Bald Marcin:
Looks like someone's back in good shape. Them two old cranks can rest easy now.

Maria:
Oh! Marcin? Is something up?

Bald Marcin:
Something? Eh... yeah, you might call this something.

Maria:
This is, um?

Bald Marcin:
Sponsors who came knocking at your door. Thirteen, in all. And there's some pretty high ranked corps looking for you...

Maria:
Whoaahh. Glorious Shield's the weapons manufacturer, right... so even companies like these are into keeping competition knights?

Zofia:
Oh, they're all Knightclub invitations. They put the numbers there to make you gasp. They're looking to make you a fine puppet, that's all.

Maria:
......

Zofia:
Maria! You wouldn't let these capitalists lead you by the nose, would you?! Remember your sister here can outbid these and then some, anyway!

Maria:
Wait... I'm not falling for anything! Just, auntie, you spending money on me like that makes me feel kind of bad...

Zofia:
Money, my high-heeled foot. If I want to spend it, I'll spend it. I didn't buy this land by agonizing about it, I'll have you know.

Maria:
(Is that why the 'gardens' here are just 'fields' now...)

Bald Marcin:
Hah hah hah... fair to you, I know you turned every last one of them down. Made a fine family out of nothing but your prize money and a few years of retirement. Hats off.

Bald Marcin:
That said, I'm only here to hand these papers over. Saves Młynar the hassle. Rest of it's up to you two alone. Think it over and if you're okay, come relax over at the bar sometime.

Zofia:
Well... what do you say? Maria?

Maria:
I've said before, but I don't want our family crest to become a corporate logo... and I know I can't stand toe-to-toe with the rest of them, either. Not as I am right now.

Zofia:
...You're going to press on?

Maria:
Mm-hm. This isn't just about the money.

Maria:
When I think of 'Nearl,' the name my grandpa and my parents protected all their lives, I can't imagine it was all just for the numbers and lines of the stock exchange.

Maria:
So...

Zofia:
Maria... Alright, it sounds like I'll be throwing all of these away, then.

Zofia:
If we're going to make the cut for the Major, we need to get a lot more points, fast—that's the biggest hurdle we face, as independent knights without a Knightclub to hide in.

Zofia:
Remember Szewczyk? Poor man, taken for a ride by his own sponsor. And yet he built up the points to rival nearly an entire team, just on sprint races, and duels alone.

Zofia:
Meanwhile, you had the Knightclubs all wrangling the rules for point transfers, arranging it so their trump cards didn't even need to fight the preselections...

Maria:
So I'll have to get past all of those Knightclub teams, soon enough...

Zofia:
That's right. That's why we're going to have to take some special measures... if we're not wasting a single qualifier, we only have so many options.

Zofia:
Such as—

Greatmouth Mob:
Welcommme, one and allllll, to the Fireblade Arena—!

Greatmouth Mob:
Fifteen teams! Fifteen knights!

Greatmouth Mob:
Today's match is a one-and-done! We'll see plundering! Crazy battles! Tight escapes and desperate chases! Welcome to the third largest arena in Kazimierz, manmade to unleash the deathmatch within every knight!

Greatmouth Mob:
What's that? You say one match only earns you one point!? Where does THAT happen!?

Greatmouth Mob:
Not here, not now! In this match, any valid attack against a fellow knight means a valid score, and that means points! Points, for fat stacks of cash!

Greatmouth Mob:
But who cares if a bunch of point-grabbers play a game!? No, I know! I know what it is you all really wanna see—

Greatmouth Mob:
You wanna watch the heroes fall! You wanna watch the great stars crash to the ground! Thaaaat's right! This season's melee matches have a new rule in the mix, the 'Points Off' clause! You hear that, knights? Risk and reward in one!

Greatmouth Mob:
Where's the spice when your points never drop?! In this match, we're following the 'Predator System!' Let's keep it simple, sister: when someone goes up one, someone else is goin' down one!

Greatmouth Mob:
Oh, yeah! Believe it, I'm scrapping to see what the do-it-alls do! Our rising stars, swallowed up! It's unprecedented, folks! A match to flip the rankings head to toe!

Greatmouth Mob:
Thought you could qualify for the Major by wining it up in a bubble bath?! You'd better risk it all right here, right now! Get ready to rumble, because the world's watching!

Greatmouth Mob:
Don't forget, our sponsored drones from Raythean Industries will be broadcasting every knight's viewpoint non-stop! Our eight registered Knights Association referees won't miss a single detail!

Greatmouth Mob:
Now, the knights are making their final checks, the crew are fitting their armor with the sensory chips! How many stars will be born today, and how many are gonna eat dirt and taste crushing defeat?!

Greatmouth Mob:
We can only wait—for the knights—to enterrrrrr—!

Old Craftsman:
What the hell? This guy again? Isn't he supposed to keep to Roar Guards territory?

Bald Marcin:
Guess he found his own rising star, now.

Old Knight:
Nah... 'Points Off?' They ever have a 'Points Off' in the melees before?

Old Knight:
And they announced this all-new system right before the match started. What, they can just do that?!

Bald Marcin:
Didn't bet on the Association being all this capricious, did we... and it doesn't bode well.

Greatmouth Mob:
Looks like all fifteen knights are readied at their places! Once the crew are out of the way, the match will officially begin!

Greatmouth Mob:
A full sixty minutes of battle! Unless every knight is down for the count, this battle goes to the very last second!

Greatmouth Mob:
Even if your points for this season take a sub-zero dive, you'll still be in the game! Wanna see backs against walls? Last-gasp attacks? You're in the right place, folks!

???:
Hey, Maria Nearl.

Maria:
—Who're you?

???:
Mmm... just one of your fans.

Greatmouth Mob:
Alright—! All fifteen knights are signalling ready!

Passing Fan:
Let's make it quick. The moment the Brassrust Knight healed up, Ashley—my Ashley—sent him straight back to the hospital. Man, the Ingras have been down on their luck for weeks now.

Greatmouth Mob:
I declare—

Passing Fan:
Now, Ashley took me right to the playoffs, so I've been a little panicked. Thought I'd try and make up a few points here. But I didn't think I'd find you too, young Nearl.

Passing Fan:
—Why don't we go for a little tête-à-tête?

Maria:
A what?

Greatmouth Mob:
—Let the Fireblade Melee—begiiiiiiiiinnnnn—!
