Old Craftsman:
Maria! How is it looking?!

Maria:
Hold on just a little longer! Let me get this last screw!

Old Craftsman:
Tighten it up! Really get it in there!

Maria:
Got it! Wait, hold on! I think I know what's wrong with the battery slot connection down here—!

Old Craftsman:
Hurry up! You know how heavy the jukebox is! I can't hold it much longer!

Bald Marcin:
Your cheese, V.

Old Knight:
...This isn't going to blow up on us like last time now, is it?

Bald Marcin:
A jukebox blowing up? That would be quite a sight to behold.

Old Knight:
How can you be sure it won't happen? If it's got something to do with Originium, Kowal will find a way to mess it up.

Old Craftsman:
Who's talking behind my back?!

Maria:
Master Kowal! C-Careful! Stop shaking it!

Old Craftsman:
Ughh, my bad. Sorry, Maria.

Old Craftsman:
V! Once I'm done over here, I'm going to teach you a lesson!

Old Knight:
Good, I'll be waiting!

Bald Marcin:
I can always count on you two to liven things up here. Just remember, if you end up fighting, anything you break, you'll have to pay for.

Old Knight:
You've heard him babble on and on like that for years, but when did you ever see him win?

Bald Marcin:
He handed you your behind just the other day.

Old Knight:
Ugh... I was drunk last time. Plus, I had arthritis... That didn't count!

Old Knight:
*Chugging intensifies*—Hah! When we made that trip to the borderlands back in the day, he wouldn't dare talk to me like this...

Old Craftsman:
V! What kind of lies are you on about this time?!

Old Knight:
You followed me to that hellhole! Who were you, if not just a affinity?!

Old Craftsman:
That was years ago! All of your affinities made it big enough to be your king by now!

???:
Maria!

Maria:
Eek!

Old Craftsman:
Uagh—! Son of a bitch! What'd you let go for?!

Maria:
M-My bad... Let me hide here for a minute...

Bald Marcin:
Zofia, go easy on the door. I've had to replace it more than a few times just this month.

Bald Marcin:
*Sigh*... This is exactly why I haven't forked out the money for an automatic door.

Old Knight:
What's going on? Why are you so worked up?

Zofia:
......

Zofia:
You're there, aren't you?

Zofia:
Ma-ri-a!

Maria:
Eeek—!

Old Craftsman:
Hey, Maria, she's coming this way. Doesn't look like that jukebox's keeping you out of sight.

Maria:
Ugh... Why is this jukebox so small...?

Maria:
How's she looking?

Old Craftsman:
Bad. I haven't seen her this mad since that time she threw that drunken knight prick out.

Old Craftsman:
—Oh, now she's smiling.

Maria:
That's even worse!

Zofia:
Kowal?

Old Craftsman:
Ahem—V! Time to hit the bottle! You were talking about me behind my back, weren't you?! I'll show you I meant it when I said I could drink you under the table!

Old Knight:
Tsk, you coward. You're just running away!

Bald Marcin:
Then perhaps you should try and see if you can help Maria's case?

Old Knight:
I-I don't even know what's going on with the two of them! I'm staying out of it!

Zofia:
Ma-ri-a, what are you hiding here for?

Maria:
...Uhh...

Zofia:
You're trying to keep something from me, aren't you? Not that I don't already know what's going on.

Maria:
Ha, haha...

Zofia:
...*Sigh*.

Zofia:
You know what it means to enter the Major, right?

Bald Marcin:
......

Old Knight:
Ohh... No wonder Zofia's furious.

Zofia:
Why didn't you come talk to me first?

Maria:
Cause I knew you'd be mad, Zofia...

Zofia:
You bet I am! You don't have the faintest idea what you're going up against!

Maria:
Umm...

Maria:
I-I know a little about it...

Zofia:
...Through your sister? The Radiant Knight of Kazimierz, one of the youngest miracles to grace the Major? Yes, of course you'd know a lot about that.

Zofia:
But—you—aren't—Margaret!

Maria:
D-Don't pinch my ear—!

Maria:
But, but! The family's in really hot water right now!

Maria:
I'm not kidding! I may not even have a bed to sleep in come next year! We'll be out of furniture to sell!

Maria:
The Association doesn't recognize a noble family without a Knight Primus. I've lost track of how many times they've come to complain about that... I-I don't have any other choice...

Zofia:
...If it comes to that, you can come live at my place. We've got a big bath and two gardens...

Zofia:
In any case, you shouldn't have signed up for the Major... That's way too rash of you...

Maria:
...Even before my grandfather passed, my uncle never wanted anything to do with the Association, let alone after.

Maria:
And it's been a while since my sister was kicked out of Kazimierz. If I don't even try to step up here...

Zofia:
...*Sigh*.

Zofia:
Even so, you should've at least talked to us... Don't just blindly chase whatever idea pops into your head.

Maria:
I'm really sorry... but I knew you'd stop me if I told you...

Zofia:
Of course I would!

Maria:
...What about now?

Zofia:
...'The Radiant Knight appears once more? Will the debuting knight of the Nearl family restore honor to the nobles?'

Zofia:
The headline on today's sports page.

Maria:
Ahaha... Margaret's as popular as ever...

Zofia:
This is no joke!

Zofia:
The media may be hyping things up with their weird headlines and lies, but It's not too late to quit, I'm telling you.

Maria:
But if I don't do this, the Nearl family will go bankrupt and lose our status as nobles!

Maria:
I know what I'm doing, Zofia... I... I have to do this.

Zofia:
Geez... Marcin, you know what knight sports are like. Help me out here—

Bald Marcin:
Yeah, I say let her try.

Zofia:
—What!?

Maria:
Marcin! Thanks!

Zofia:
No, no, no. With the way she is, she wouldn't win in a fight against me even if I tied one hand behind my back! Are you sure?

Maria:
What a mean thing to say!

Old Knight:
Now, now. You made it to the Final 16 in the Major. She'd be earning more than a passing grade to take you with just one hand.

Old Craftsman:
That's right. V here wouldn't even stand a chance even if you tied one hand behind your back.

Old Knight:
You wanna say that again!?

Old Craftsman:
All of us regulars here may all be old, retired folks past our prime, but we still got an eye for people, and we know what potential looks like... creepy old men that we are... Eh, she'll do fine.

Old Knight:
That's no way to talk! That's not even a compliment!

Old Craftsman:
You know what I'm talking about! Don't tell me you knights don't get sick of talking like a walking encyclopedia!

Bald Marcin:
Ahem—V is right.

Bald Marcin:
I trust Maria's talent. Her Arts and swordsmanship isn't bad at all. You of all people should know. You've been practicing with her since she was just a kid.

Zofia:
But she's been so into mechanical work these last few years. I thought she wanted to become a mechanic...

Maria:
That's just a hobby. I don't want to give it up... but you've got to do what you've got to do, right?

Maria:
Ow!

Zofia:
...I still haven't forgiven you for making that decision on your own. This really isn't a joke.

Bald Marcin:
...I agree with Zofia on that.

Bald Marcin:
I admire you doing everything you can for your family, and with a smile on your face, but knight sports aren't all fun and games like they are for tourists and the crowd.

Bald Marcin:
In fact, you'll find there's nothing fun about it.

Marcin lifts his hand up—Much of his arm has been replaced with robotic parts. The joint rattles metallically.

Maria:
Oh...

Bald Marcin:
This is what happens if you let your guard down.

Old Knight:
Yeah... I remember that. You were up against a Victorian with two blades.

Old Knight:
You still won, in the end.

Bald Marcin:
Yes, but at what price?

Bald Marcin:
This is the kind of glory you get in the Major. Now even cleaning a wine glass is a chore.

Old Knight:
The Major, hmph.

Bald Marcin:
There's no mercy or respect in the arena. The only thing real there is the blood that splatters the ground.

Bald Marcin:
The audience cheers for their entertainment, and the sponsors treat you well because it fills their coffers.

Bald Marcin:
Think it through, look at all the difficulties you'll face, and only then should you press on. That's what makes a real knight.

Maria:
I... I understand...

Zofia:
...Maria.

Maria:
...Yeah. I'm serious.

Maria:
Uncle's always said that even if we're stripped of our nobility and the family crest falls, it won't be the end of our lineage...

Maria:
But I still want to protect everything that my sister and grandfather fought to defend.

Maria:
Margaret isn't here anymore, and as one of the youngest members of the Nearl family, I can't just stand by and watch my family fall from grace.

Maria:
If I do that, I'll end up hating myself to death.

Zofia:
......

Old Knight:
Even when you know the path ahead will be ruthless and treacherous, you still embark on the journey. That's what it means to be a knight.

Old Knight:
You can do it. This one's for you.

Old Craftsman:
Hear, hear. To Maria!

Bald Marcin:
(Holds mug up)

Zofia:
...*Sigh*, I was hoping you people would help me talk her out of it. Turns out, you're encouraging her.

Maria:
Oh... Zofia. Please, Auntie Zofia! Please, I beg you!

Zofia:
Stop it! Leave my age out of this! I'm only five years older than you!

Zofia:
...Well, I'm part of the Nearl family. I know how you feel, but I still think—

Maria:
I'll work on my swordsmanship skills! I'll be good! Please, you can trust me!

Maria:
Oh yeah! Why don't you be my coach—

Zofia:
Oh...?

Maria:
(Whoops—)

Zofia:
Now that reminds me. When was the last time we trained together?

Maria:
...Probably before Margaret left Kazimierz?

Zofia:
And what was the last technique I taught you? Where did it come from? How do you apply it in combat?

Maria:
Uh... Hahaha... I-I wonder?

Zofia:
Yes, this is perfect.

Zofia:
We'll meet at the training grounds in the garden tomorrow morning. You won't be late, will you? Lady Maria, the Knightess?

Maria:
Hm? Y-Yeah... I'll be there.
