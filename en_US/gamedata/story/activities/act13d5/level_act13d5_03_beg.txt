Everyone:
Cheers—!

Old Craftsman:
Congrats, kid! That was a beautiful match! You're much stronger than V now!

Old Knight:
Yes, she is, but who made you the judge!?

Old Craftsman:
Huuhh?!

Zofia:
Why are you two fighting again...? Hey now, stop it. You're disturbing the other customers.

Maria:
Ahaha... They're arm wrestling already...

Bald Marcin:
That was a good one indeed, kid. This one is for you.

Maria:
Ah... thank you!

Bald Marcin:
Not only did you manage to find Szewczyk's weakness, you even finished him in one blow. You did really well.

Bald Marcin:
The fight lasted for almost twenty minutes. Maria had been at a disadvantage during most of the fight, but she turned the tables on him with just one crucial strike—

Bald Marcin:
—Very well done.

Maria:
I-It wasn't anything special... I wouldn't have been able to do it if he wasn't wearing a flawed set of armor...

Maria:
I'd never heard of the model Jack 2 before... If the cooling system could paralyze the armor even for a short time, then it's definitely still a prototype.

Bald Marcin:
—That said, Szewczyk's an experienced competition knight, and endorsing untested products actually isn't that uncommon at all. He also managed to hide the armor's weaknesses well.

Bald Marcin:
Don't be so humble. It's barbaric, but the Major has always been about results and results only.

Maria:
O-Okay...

Zofia:
...Maria!

Maria:
Yes, ma'am!

Zofia:
Don't get too ahead of yourself!

Maria:
Right!

Zofia:
You need to know how to control your emotions—Don't just act normal, you need to proactively reflect on yourself and normalize your emotions...

Zofia:
...The less you think complacency's an issue, the more dangerous it is. It's very difficult to realize yourself just what victory does to your emotions...

Zofia:
And that carelessness... will... be the end of you!

Maria:
G-Got it!

Maria:
...Auntie? Are you drunk?

Zofia:
No! And don't call me 'Auntie!'

Old Craftsman:
—I won!!

Old Knight:
Sod it, Kowal. How did you get this buff in just half a year?!

Old Craftsman:
I've been fixing pipes. You've got a problem with that?

Old Knight:
Hmph...

Maria:
Kowal, Vogelweide, is Zofia...?

Zofia:
Maria... Call me 'Auntie'... one more time... I'll... mess ya upp...

Old Craftsman:
Yeah... Looks like she's really drunk. Don't see that often.

Zofia:
I... I'm not... drunk!

Old Craftsman:
Fine, whatever you say. Maria, take your aunt to the couch in the back. Let her sleep it off there.

Maria:
Eh... O-Okay... Auntie, lift your leg up...

Zofia:
Who's yer 'Auntie?!'

Old Craftsman:
Zofia can usually really hold her liquor... Well, not that she can drink as much as me.

Old Knight:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just because you had drinks with a few folks from Yan once, you're all full of yourself? Have you no shame, trying to beat a young lady at downing booze?

Bald Marcin:
She's under a lot of pressure... It's her first time watching a match as a coach, and she had to listen to Greatmouth Mob jabber on and on.

Bald Marcin:
That brings back memories... *Sigh*, I've been like this ever since Maria won. I guess I'm old now.

Old Knight:
What are you talking about? We're all about the same age!

Bald Marcin:
I guess that means I'm actually old, then.

Old Knight:
Hey.

Bald Marcin:
...Yeah, how long ago was it when Zofia first stepped into the arena? Twelve years ago? Fifteen?

Old Knight:
How old you are is none of my business, and I don't remember exactly when, but Zofia's not that old...

Old Knight:
It was nine years ago, wasn't it? The Blood Knight, The Radiant Knight, The Black Knight... It was three seasons ago.

Bald Marcin:
The Black Knight... That Caprinae, huh? Feels like a lifetime ago.

Old Knight:
Well, she won the three Majors before that too. The media likes to treat her like some sort of emblem of that generation or something.

Maria:
Oh, the three-time consecutive winner?

Old Craftsman:
Yeah, normally, they don't pick words that common when they come up with titles, lest they get repeated and complicate things.

Old Craftsman:
But that Leithanian lass. She actually deserves the title 'Black.' She's a monster, no mistake.

Old Craftsman:
I heard she's working for some large company outside the country, tsk, tsk.

Old Knight:
Someone like her's no knight... Not in my book.

Maria:
I-I see...

Old Knight:
...Maria, has Zofia ever told you anything about her career in the Major?

Maria:
No. There are the videos and stats from each season, but she hasn't told me anything herself...

Maria:
I think Auntie Zofia made it to the top 16 that year, and during the round of 16...

Old Knight:
That's right. She was heavily wounded.

Old Knight:
Her opponent was the 'Fissure.' That reminds me, did he enter the Major this year?

Bald Marcin:
......

Old Craftsman:
*Sigh*... Why are we talking about the past? We're here to celebrate Maria's win!

Old Craftsman:
That wasn't a very fun story anyway. Let's move on to something else!

Maria:
Actually... I'm kinda curious about that...

Maria:
I managed to win, but it doesn't seem like Zofia's very happy about it... She didn't even say anything and went straight to drinking...

Maria:
I'm sure she thought really hard about all this for me... I don't want to let her down... so I want to know more about her past and how she feels about everything.

Old Craftsman:
Well... You're just like your sister when it comes to that.

Maria:
Me?

Old Knight:
That's right. You're always quick to notice if something's amiss, and you always try to do something about it.

Old Knight:
That last attack of the match. Did Zofia teach you that?

Maria:
N-No, actually—

Bald Marcin:
You copied Margaret's move?

Maria:
Eh? Oh, umm... Yeah... was it obvious?

Bald Marcin:
Hahaha, of course. You two are so alike! And I'll never forget that day.

Bald Marcin:
The miracle of the Radiant Knight, the youngest ever champion. She accomplished all that without help from anyone else.

Bald Marcin:
And she doesn't show it, but Zofia actually really looks up to Margaret.

Bald Marcin:
She was just a lady-in-waiting to your family, but she really tried her hardest. She even had us old farts help her train...

Bald Marcin:
She entered the preliminaries, won, and made it into the Major... From the beginning all the way to the end, she didn't accept any sponsorship offers, nor did she ever ask anyone for help.

Bald Marcin:
Heh... I even introduced her to a few small businesses I knew back in the day, but she turned down every one of them.

Old Craftsman:
...Those companies are all trash. She made the right call to turn them down.

Old Knight:
Shut up. That's exactly why 'Fissure' defeated Zofia.

Maria:
What happened...?

Bald Marcin:
Maria, a competition knight needs a lot of resources... That's something you'll come to know... The weapons and equipment you bring to battle could be the difference between life and death.

Bald Marcin:
Szewczyk probably only lost to you because the armor they made him wear had a design flaw.

Bald Marcin:
Suppose he wore a set of armor that had no flaws at all, maybe even with far superior capabilities. What happens then? Do you think you could've won?

Maria:
I...

Maria:
...Probably not...

Bald Marcin:
That's the kind of opponent Zofia faced. Flawless armor, weapons, and support. The difference between them was immense.

Bald Marcin:
Zofia paid for her own equipment. She perfected her technique all alone, and she made all the connections herself. It was just her, and she fought so hard.

Old Craftsman:
...*Sigh*.

Bald Marcin:
We never did anything for her except watch her get hurt and throw in the towel.

Bald Marcin:
Was there anything we could've done?

Maria:
Marcin...

Old Craftsman:
At the very least, you could help Zofia train the kid.

Bald Marcin:
Hahaha, I doubt Maria would want to be coached by ol' one-armed Marcin, the same man who had a hand in Zofia's injury, indirectly.

Maria:
No, I would love to! I've always admired all of you! I mean it!

Bald Marcin:
Hm? It's not often we get other customers. How unusual...

Old Knight:
You'll probably go out of business at this rate.

Corporate Employee:
...Uh.

Corporate Employee:
Excuse me... Are you Maria Nearl, the knightess?

Maria:
Uh... That's right.

Corporate Employee:
Pleased to meet you, Ms. Maria. Do you have time to talk right now?

Maria:
Sure, is there something I can do for you?

Corporate Employee:
I'm here to represent the Słoma Corporation... Here is my business card.

Corporate Employee:
Please accept my apologies. My company's representative has sent several invitations to your residence, but we have yet to receive a reply. I'm sorry for visiting you here uninvited.

Maria:
Oh... uh... I think... there's a bit of problem with our mailbox... Haha...

Maria:
So, did you need something from me?

Corporate Employee:
You see, my company is one of the sponsors of the Eszeweria Knightclub. Its leader was very impressed by your performance against Mr. Szewczyk.

Corporate Employee:
As soon as he found out you are not currently affiliated, he wanted to know if you would be interested in a contract with the knightclub, and contacted our business department to facilitate discussion...

Maria:
...They want to sign me?

Corporate Employee:
Yes... and actually, our CEO is very interested in having you on board...

Old Knight:
(Kowal, isn't Słoma the food company that has straws in their logo?)

Old Craftsman:
(You moron. Why don't you take a look at the logo they stamped on those saltines you're eating?)

Old Craftsman:
(Eszeweria is one of the top 100 knightclubs... Though they're a bunch of businesspeople more interested in making money from sponsorships and ads than entering competitions...)

Corporate Employee:
Not only that, but MARTHE Kazimierz's PR Department has also pledged to cosponsor all of the knightclub's future developments with Słoma, should you agree to sign with the club.

Maria:
MA-MARTHE!? You mean that MARTHE?

Corporate Employee:
Yes, that's correct. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach...

Zofia:
Mm... How did I... How long have I been out?

Maria:
Oh, Zofia, you're up.

Maria:
Not that long. You slept for about ten minutes only...

Zofia:
I can't be napping. We still have to plan out where we're getting the rest of our points this month—

Zofia:
You...

Corporate Employee:
...Zofia? I-Is that you?

Zofia:
Oh. Yeah, I remember you. You're that young manager at...

Corporate Employee:
No, not anymore... Now I'm just a... nobody running errands for Słoma...

Corporate Employee:
I see, so 'Whislash' is Ms. Maria's coach. All the better.

Corporate Employee:
There are many young and enterprising knights like you two on the Eszeweria Knightclub's roster. The business department has many ways to further your reputation and worth without merely resorting to tournament matches...

Maria:
But it sounds like...

Zofia:
...You'll be something like a star or an idol. Your face will be all over the intercity net, and no one will care about your scores in the competitions anymore. They'll just be throwing money at whatever they see your face on.

Maria:
That's kinda hard to believe...

Zofia:
That's how the industry works. They spend nearly all of their budget on finding spokesmen. Then, they film some phony ads to try to make a buck from the ordinary folks.

Zofia:
It's simple, and it's a lot more effective than you think. Makes you wonder where the problem actually lies.

Corporate Employee:
...That is more or less the case, if put in less flattering terms. However, on behalf of the General Chamber of Commerce, the Słoma company can promise that you will still be conferred both the knighthood and a title.

Zofia:
...What do you want to do?

Maria:
This is way too sudden, I...

Zofia:
Honestly... I think it's okay to accept their offer.

Maria:
Eh?

Zofia:
You won't need to put yourself in harm's way, and the family will keep its nobility. It's a good deal. You might even have a bigger garden than me come this time next year.

Maria:
But yours is full of nothing but weeds. I'm not sure what I'd do with a garden even bigger than that...

Zofia:
Hm?

Maria:
N-Never mind.

Corporate Employee:
If you agree right now, we have an agreement here, ready to go. Rest assured, you will find the terms very favorable.

Maria:
......

Maria:
I...

Maria:
I'm sorry... but I don't want my family crest to become some commercial trinket. At the very least, I don't want to have to rely on anyone...

Corporate Employee:
...I beg your pardon?

Zofia:
Maria?

Maria:
Yeah, I know, Zofia.

Maria:
I don't like how Uncle Młynar does things, but I don't want to bring shame to Margaret and Grandpa's struggle.

Maria:
So... I'm sorry, but I don't think that is the right path for me to take...

Corporate Employee:
...Well... your response is certainly... unexpected...

Corporate Employee:
H-However, the General Chamber of Commerce has prepared for you an assortment of proposals—Please have a look.

Zofia:
The Chamber? Isn't this usually under the Association's purview?

Corporate Employee:
Err... I-I'm sure you understand. This is why our CEO insists you join us...

Zofia:
......

Maria:
Yeah, thanks... but... I'm sorry, I have to refuse.

Corporate Employee:
Y-Yes, I understand. Right... You refuse... uhh...

Corporate Employee:
Well... Ms. Zofia, Ms. Maria... This isn't part of the business proposal, but please at least hear me out...

Maria:
Uh... your teeth are chattering... A-Are you crying? All I did was decline your offer... It's no big deal!

Corporate Employee:
Uh, n-no... I'm simply hoping that... in the event that anyone else comes to you—Ms. Maria, in particular—with any business propositions, please—

Corporate Employee:
—Please seriously consider accepting! I'm begging you. This is very important to us...

Corporate Employee:
N-Now... please excuse me... before I embarrass myself any more...

Old Craftsman:
Helping other companies out...? That's a new one.

Old Knight:
Yeah... That's really strange.

Zofia:
...Maria, when is your next match?

Maria:
In three days.

Zofia:
Who are you up against? Did the Association contact you?

Maria:
Uh... I guess not?

Zofia:
Let's go home, Maria. Judging from your performance this time, you still have lots of room for improvement.

Old Craftsman:
Now? We haven't even started celebrating!

Bald Marcin:
Kowal, let them go.

Bald Marcin:
Zofia, be careful. Keep an eye peeled.

Zofia:
—Yeah, I got it. Let's go, Maria.

Maria:
Okay, wait up—!

???:
...Ingra? 'Brassrust' Ingra? The National Council let him go again?

???:
Well, what did you expect? That huge megacorporation has his back... The Victorians he crippled must be peeved.

???:
But well... This is perfect.

Greatmouth Mob:
Ladies and Gentlemen!

Greatmouth Mob:
No promises, no rules, and no limits!

Greatmouth Mob:
Here, we have two knights, their armor, a battlefield, and nothing else! Rules, conditions, arrangements, protective measures, nothing!

Greatmouth Mob:
As the most important preliminary event of the Kazimierz Major, these tryouts have been going on for three months already, and there are still contestants throwing their hats in the ring!

Greatmouth Mob:
Even so, I dare say, what we're about to witness today is unlike anything we've seen before!

Greatmouth Mob:
The contestants standing before us now both come from long lines of knights!

Greatmouth Mob:
Yes, yes, I can hear you hiss. Worry not! This will be among the most entertaining matches you've seen, and I put my career and reputation on the line to say that!

Greatmouth Mob:
You are bound to start cheering the moment you hear their names! You have my word!

Greatmouth Mob:
First, on this side, we have the youngest son of the Ingra family, Olmer Ingra!

Greatmouth Mob:
That's right. He's the one who been taken to court countless times for crippling anyone who dares cross him, and thanks to the coffers of his countless sponsors has been ruled innocent over and over by the National Council! 'Brassrust' Ingra!

Greatmouth Mob:
The Butcher of the Field from the Bloodboil Knightclub! The ruthless knight who has never allowed even a single opponent to step out of the ring in one piece!

Greatmouth Mob:
He will beat his armor, his rage, and his mercilessness into the heart of each and every one of his opponents! And most likely their skulls, too!

Greatmouth Mob:
And on the other side! The other side—

Greatmouth Mob:
Oh, ooh! One of the oldest knight families, Nearl! Let us say their name out loud! Nearl!

Greatmouth Mob:
The hero of Kazimierz who outsmarted the Leithanians all by himself, the Tenebrous Knight who assassinated the king's traitorous retinue, and, last but not least, the Radiant Knight, the embodiment of shame who was exiled for getting infected!

Greatmouth Mob:
All of them came from this family!

Greatmouth Mob:
What's that? Not up for a history lesson? Fine! Well then, who managed to defeat the Roar K.C.'s vanguard, Szewczyk, before she even got her own title?

Greatmouth Mob:
Who's the Roar Arena most popular knight of the month?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Will all this change because of this one match? Will 'Brassrust' bash in this pretty little face of hers?

Greatmouth Mob:
Let us welcome—Maria Nearl—!

Greatmouth Mob:
What will be the outcome of this battle? Who will reign victorious? Pick up the terminals next to your seats and start voting!

Greatmouth Mob:
You know the rules! Your monetary support won't influence the match's outcome, but it will directly influence whether your wallet's empty or brimming with cash!

Zofia:
—Maria!

Maria:
Eh?

Zofia:
Let's forfeit this match... okay? Just listen to me this once. Just this match...

Maria:
...Auntie?

Maria:
I've already entered the battlefield... As a knight, I mustn't back down.

Zofia:
...You're right.

Zofia:
Go get him, Maria.

Zofia:
Show everyone here what you're made of.
