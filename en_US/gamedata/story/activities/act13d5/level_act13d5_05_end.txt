Spokesman Czarny:
What exactly is a knight competition?

Spokesman Czarny:
Mr. Szewczyk, what do you think?

Plastic Knight:
...Forget the song and dance, Czarny, I'm busy.

Plastic Knight:
Out with it. What are you up to?

Spokesman Czarny:
I'm very sorry to say... the Roar Knightclub has decided to switch you out of pole position in their starting lineup for the Major. Their new safeguard knight ranks highly just as you do, and his Arts should be useful to the team.

Plastic Knight:
......

Plastic Knight:
This... is nothing like what we agreed...

Spokesman Czarny:
Of course, your down payment will still clear. But the rates for a knightclub's reserve are an invariably different question. You understand this, correct?

Spokesman Czarny:
Now, now... don't make any hasty moves. Your child is celebrating a tenth birthday soon, I hear. You needn't lose your job now over assaulting someone as insignificant as myself...

Spokesman Czarny:
Roar Knightclub will still be paying you plenty. You needn't make any efforts for at least the rest of the year.

Plastic Knight:
I need the lineup corrected, for God's sakes! I...

Spokesman Czarny:
That'll be up to your own performance, Szewczyk. There's always a way to live on, is there not?

Plastic Knight:
......

Plastic Knight:
...You're not wrong.

Plastic Knight:
You could've just sent out any old envoy to tell me this. Why'd you need to meet me personally? Are all spokespeople this bored for something to do?

Spokesman Czarny:
Ah... don't misunderstand me. I didn't come out here specifically for you. I was only here to make sure of some event arrangements.

Spokesman Czarny:
It seems we've been a little lax in parts. Our divisions have each encountered very minor bumps in the road, which some offenders are seeing fit to take advantage of.

Plastic Knight:
...Are you threatening me? Threatening 'Plastic' Knight Szewczyk to take on your dirty work?

Spokesman Czarny:
Nothing of the sort.

Plastic Knight:
Then what are you trying to do here?

Spokesman Czarny:
Right now, I have two particular knights who are currently working to enter the arena... but, unfortunately, they clearly do not have the points to do so.

Plastic Knight:
Pfah... If you want a knight to make it in, you have your ways...

Spokesman Czarny:
Don't put it like that. There are times one must respect the rules, and keep some conduct undisclosed—

Spokesman Czarny:
—Making use of the law versus violating it is a night and day affair, after all. The fundamental difference lies in whether the parties involved possess the capacity to do so.

Spokesman Czarny:
Just give it one nod of assent, and we'll add an event for the transfer of points, along with all its formalities. Of course, in much the same manner, I can settle of some of your complications with the Roar Knightclub...

Spokesman Czarny:
How would you feel about that?

Greatmouth Mob:
—OUT! The Strider Knight's sole-mount accelerator devices are non-functional! That sudden brake knocks him off right before the finish—!

Greatmouth Mob:
ACROSS THE LINE—! The winner, from Gloryfall Knightclub, is the Wisteria Knight! And right behind, Maria Nearl—hounding that medal!

Greatmouth Mob:
With his accelerators out, the Strider Knight has fallen all the way from second place to seventh—! It's not a good day to be the Strider!

Greatmouth Mob:
It just goes to show how crucial a knight's equipment is!

Greatmouth Mob:
And Ellen Select Technologies, who provide intimate maintenance, repair and upgrades to your equipment with their comprehensive member plans, have provided a no-expense-spared package for our knights!

Maria:
Phew... runner-up, huh?

Maria:
(This way... I'm another step closer to the Major...)

Maria:
(Auntie Zofia...)

Bald Marcin:
Oh, there's an unexpected customer.

Bald Marcin:
Please, sit wherever you'd like.

Plastic Knight:
Marcin... it's really you? That tremendous knight of days gone by runs this little bar now?

Bald Marcin:
They stripped old Marcin of his knighthood long ago. Now all he does is eat up his savings.

Bald Marcin:
How'd 'Plastic' Szewczyk find his way to this little place? Tell you the truth, this bar doesn't see all that many active knights in it.

Plastic Knight:
If you're tremendous past, Maria's tremendous present. They carried a story about your bar on the entertainment news last night.

Plastic Knight:
Hmph... tremendous all around. I'll have a 'Red Edelweiss.'

Bald Marcin:
This one's on me.

Plastic Knight:
My pleasure.

Bald Marcin:
Roar Guards' training camp's a long way away. I won't let you waste the trip.

Bald Marcin:
So, you've come to enemy headquarters to spy on us, then? Right that old newspaper-worthy wrong for the Majors?

Plastic Knight:
...I'm not going to be in the Majors.

Bald Marcin:
Huh... Roar Guards' decision? Thought you and your sponsors were on pretty good personal terms?

Plastic Knight:
Ha. Personal terms. Managing a relationship with a corp is like dating a Catastrophe.

Plastic Knight:
As always, the decision came from the next floor up...

Bald Marcin:
Knights Association?

Plastic Knight:
Worse than that... try the General Chamber of Commerce.

Bald Marcin:
Hum.

Plastic Knight:
I know what you want to say, Marcin. Up there, you're thinking, 'how's a tiny little Plastic Knight get into such a big mess?'

Plastic Knight:
I still know my limits, and nobody goes this overkill on a knight who knows how to follow plans, so their problem is elsewhere.

Plastic Knight:
A rumor's spreading door-to-door. People saying the Radiant Knight was never even Infected, that her exile from Kazimierz was more complicated than that...

Bald Marcin:
Like hell I know.

Plastic Knight:
Put your guard down... I'm not probing you here, Marcin.

Plastic Knight:
I just want Czarny to learn there's a price to pay for pissing about with nobles... and I'm assuming he's got one eye on Maria Nearl too, doesn't he?

Bald Marcin:
...The knights are joining hands and protesting the Association? This sort of thing won't ever end well.

Plastic Knight:
I'm just trying not to be ridden roughshod.

Plastic Knight:
Thanks for the drink... Marcin, one last word... when I was young, it was watching your matches that made me finally decide to become a knight.

Bald Marcin:
Went the wrong way back then, looks like.

Plastic Knight:
No. I'm ready to go my own way now, aren't I?

Plastic Knight:
See you next time, old Marcin.

Bald Marcin:
Szewczyk, my own last word... stay safe.

Plastic Knight:
...Hmph. No knight ever needed to bow to the peddlers. Roar Knightclub'll see things my way.

Flametail' Sona:
Hey, you've been tailing us for ages now. Time you showed your face, right?

Flametail' Sona:
Oh, the overbearing type... No, I do NOT like fans like you...

Flametail' Sona:
'Wait—that bow—are you—?!'

Flametail' Sona:
—Thought I'd say that and keel over, Armorless Union assassin?

Flametail' Sona:
Hmm... so this is how you're molded. Way you dodge about everywhere, no-one's actually seen your looks before. Real gloomy line of work you're in...

Flametail' Sona:
Don't get the chance everyday—

Ashlock Knight:
...Hey.

Flametail' Sona:
—to have a real scrap, you and us.

Maria:
......

Maria:
......

Maria:
Ah—auntie—

Młynar:
......

Maria:
Oh... uncle...

Młynar:
I look away from you for a second, and you somehow dig yourself even deeper.

Maria:
......

Młynar:
And when are you planning to stop?

Młynar:
The leadership has been asking me time and time again about you. Every day I work in the Publicity Department is spent sorting out the trouble you cause... Half of my hours at work are lost to waiting for direction from the leadership.

Młynar:
Go to the Knights Association this moment and exit the tournament. You don't have the faintest idea what you're doing.

Maria:
Is that what you wanted to say...

Młynar:
You will not kill yourself over this, Maria.

Młynar:
You are a child of the Nearl family. You ought to know restraint.

Młynar:
These annoyances all lie low in the face of the Major, so this is up to you to do, but you've already earned yourself plenty of attention.

Młynar:
Abandon the idea that you can force your way into the Major. Abandon, also, any idea that you've yet faced the strongest competition knights.

Maria:
But I don't want to just sit and watch while the Nearl family's nobility gets stripped—

Młynar:
—Vainglory.

Maria:
*Sigh*...

Młynar:
I've made it clear before that the Nearls do not need the approval of the Knights Association, obscene as it now is.

Młynar:
Have you somehow come to believe that without their recognition, our ancestors' deeds would cease to exist? Nonsense! For all these years, the Nearl family stood alone to defend our name!

Młynar:
What one cannot do, one must abandon. When one does not know how to give up... that blind alley is their end.

Maria:
Uncle...

Młynar:
Margaret has influenced you too much, Maria. She could never recognize her own ignorance, and you are not to blindly follow her example.

Maria:
......!

Młynar:
Don't give me that look. Have I said anything wrong? And surmounting the rulesetters within their own rules? Lunatic ravings.

Młynar:
You know Margaret's temper. What she ultimately despised was the commercialization of the competition knights. I thought she had some backbone...

Młynar:
And what happened? Back against the wall, she still chose the path of competition, to flaunt her 'convictions.' Yes, indeed. 'Convictions.'

Młynar:
And could she change anything?

Maria:
Uncle... don't talk about Margaret like this...

Młynar:
She could not.

Młynar:
The one thing she changed was how the corporations treated the Nearl family! The one thing she accomplished was forcing my father, bedridden as he was, to clean up her mess!

Młynar:
'The Radiant Knight' is a title she should've never been conferred! She has no power to shoulder any glory of the sort!

Maria:
Uncle!

Młynar:
......

Maria:
So what about you...?

Maria:
Aren't you... working for the corporations, even now?

Maria:
You forbid me from competing while you go play servant boy to the corporations and watch the Nearl family's knighthood slip away? You can stomach that?!

Młynar:
...Hm.

Młynar:
You're still young. For that, I won't blame your ignorance... but you should show respect to your elders.

Maria:
This again...

Młynar:
The skyscrapers... that the people of Kazimierz built, generation upon generation, cast the shadows that hide you in your hometown, shielded by your elders. What could you see from this safety?

Młynar:
Did you truly believe you had something? As nothing more than a young, fledgling knight?

Młynar:
When the sun dawned over the frontier fortresses, the Ursus skyscrapers drew their line in the  clouds on the horizon.

Młynar:
The tower attendants recreated the motions of battle in the arena to please their nobles. The young steam knights donned the armor of old to temper and hone their skills.

Młynar:
Bounty hunters and robbers razed one destitute village after another, while the great cities were absorbed in hopes of building ever more arenas. One could call the harvest of a village versus the tax it pays comical.

Młynar:
But all of that paled to the last sigh my father uttered on his deathbed. Not for Margaret, not for your parents—it was his lament given to all of Kazimierz.

Młynar:
How could you not disappoint me?

Maria:
......

Młynar:
You're right, Maria, you're right. I am good for nothing, nothing more than a corporate, captive burdenbeast.

Młynar:
So. What about you?

Młynar:
...Director? No, just a quick personal matter to tend to... No, of course work takes priority over personal...

Młynar:
The project meeting? Today? No, I didn't forget... Apologies, my greatest apologies, I'm very sorry, you're right...

Młynar:
I'll be back there momentarily... What? No, he doesn't understand the scope of the project... Yes, I'm sorry...

Młynar:
Then if... If he could present in my stead... Yes, my apologies... The manager's responsibility? I... Yes, this will be the last time. No, there won't be a next time.

Młynar:
You may terminate me if this happens again. Yes, of course, I promise.

Młynar:
I am truly deeply sorry, Director.

Młynar:
...I do not have much time to waste, Maria. Give me an answer, now.

Maria:
You won't change my mind, Uncle.

Młynar:
......

Maria:
......

Młynar:
You're just like Margaret... you disgust me.

Młynar:
Your parents would find no pride in you. Take some time to calm down. Start thinking hard about who you really are.

Maria:
...Please, just stop talking!

Młynar:
Ignorant of the world and its untold ways... Pray for blessings. That is all you have left.
