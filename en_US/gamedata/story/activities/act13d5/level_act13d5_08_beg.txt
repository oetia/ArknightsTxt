Maria:
Team battle?

Zofia:
It's a two on two, a rather uncommon competition format. Originally, to showcase the teamwork within the Knightclubs, it should've been at least three on three or four on four.

Zofia:
No matter the format, you don't have a Knightclub, so we need to find you a partner.

Maria:
Oh... Who am I up against?

Zofia:
The competition schedule says it's the Snowyheel Knightclub.

Bald Marcin:
...They have some decent archers, and even one knight that uses meteor hammers. I don't know who you'll end up against.

Bald Marcin:
Maria's finally reached the point where we'll know her opponents by name alone, huh.

Maria:
Ahaha......

Zofia:
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing...

Bald Marcin:
Maria, defeating Tytus is definitely something worth celebrating, but it also means that there will be a lot more eyes on you.

Bald Marcin:
Draw on the lessons you learned from Flametail and Ashlock. Don't tip your hand.

Bald Marcin:
It's important to compromise and work with the corporations when you have to. Times have changed. You can't hold onto your glory with wins alone.

Maria:
......

Zofia:
...Why didn't you help me convince her last time?

Bald Marcin:
I did have a proper conversation with Maria after you slammed the door——By the way, you broke my door that time.

Zofia:
Ugh. I'll cover it...

Zofia:
Where's V and Kowal?

Bald Marcin:
It's 'that day.' They're not back yet.

Zofia:
Ah... They're at the gravesite. Shit, I wanted to ask if he could help repair Maria's equipment...

Bald Marcin:
Just use his workshop.

Bald Marcin:
He even said so himself, one time last year, drunkenly. If you ever wanted to, Maria, he would gladly pass on his workshop to you.

Maria:
Eh?! Why haven't I this before?

Bald Marcin:
Either way, he's still sworn to never touch the anvil again.

Zofia:
*Sigh*... Even after so many years...

Bald Marcin:
It's hard enough for anyone to let go of the past, let alone us oldies who have nothing but the past.

Zofia:
Lets forget about them for now. Maria, you'll need to fix up your equipment yourself.

Zofia:
And then... Do you have a partner in mind?

Maria:
Me? Umm...

Maria:
......

Maria:
D-Do I actually not have any knight friends?

Zofia:
That's why I wanted to introduce you to someone. A known quantity is always safer than getting a random stranger assigned by the Association.

Maria:
Err, who is it?

Zofia:
The Fartooth Knight. She's an expert archer.

Zofia:
Just like you, she fought her way up as an independent knight, refusing to accept sponsorships from the corporations. I've heard she's even planning to form a completely self-sufficient knightclub.

Zofia:
I think you'll be able to get along, and cover each other's weaknesses in battle. You'll come to understand that team battles are completely different from melees or one-on-ones.

Zofia:
If only we had more time, you could get to know each other better on the training field. Unfortunately, you'll have to improvise.

Maria:
...O-okay.

Bald Marcin:
This is the disadvantage of being an independent knight... Temporary allies fighting against a battle-hardened team will always be at a disadvantage.

Maria:
I wonder what she's like... I'm a little nervous...

Spokesman Czarny:
This is our third time passing this street today.

Corporate Employee:
Ah, yes, Mr. Czarny...

Spokesman Czarny:
You're very accustomed to such work. Running between the various arenas and joining in countless teleconferences.

Corporate Employee:
Ah, no... There's nothing to be said for someone like me...

Spokesman Czarny:
Your appearance is somewhat sloppy. One's appearance is also an important bargaining chip, is it not?

Corporate Employee:
A-Apologies... To be honest, I was unemployed not too long ago... So...

Spokesman Czarny:
Oh... What has that got to do with this?

Spokesman Czarny:
I don't dislike employees like you. Only those who have fallen to rock bottom are able to understand the cruelty we face. It is only when you have acknowledged it, that you will be able to make satisfactory decisions.

Corporate Employee:
......

Spokesman Czarny:
Remember each and every word I have said, each and every action I have taken.

Corporate Employee:
Eh? Ah, the meeting minutes for the Snowyheel Knightclub? Don't worry, I've prepared——

Spokesman Czarny:
No no no, their sponsor is an old friend of mine. They won't trouble us much.

Spokesman Czarny:
It's just for a particularly insignificant...working habit of mine.

Zofia:
...Maria.

Maria:
Hm?

Zofia:
You know I never approved of you becoming a competition knight, not since the beginning.

Maria:
Eh, huh? Where did that come from? I knew that already...

Zofia:
But you've proven yourself.

Maria:
Though it was always by the skin of my teeth...

Zofia:
Rather than your motivations, platitudes, promises or whatnot... Winning in the arena is the only proof of your determination.

Zofia:
Even though you're still very naive.

Maria:
Ahaha......

Zofia:
Maybe...it's your desire to win back the glory of the Nearl family that makes you so strong.

Zofia:
——Though it was just a fluke, being able to take a point off Tytus means your upcoming opponents should be manageable.

Zofia:
You've developed your own Arts techniques, but it doesn't seem to work against particularly strong opponents, unfortunately.

Zofia:
For example, if the Left-hand Knight had fought seriously from the start, you would've probably lost even if there were four of you.

Zofia:
I can teach you swordsmanship and tactics, and you can ask V about archery techniques. He may not look it, but back in the day V was an expert your granddad respected.

Zofia:
——But when it comes to Arts, you are the only one who can grasp your light.

Zofia:
Got it?

Maria:
Mm-hm!

Spokesman Czarny:
Yes... Even though there were unexpected incidents, our plans are progressing on schedule.

Spokesman Czarny:
What? No, you're overestimating our clients. There will definitely not be any condemnation from the audience. They're not a particularly moral bunch.

Spokesman Czarny:
Yes, you're right. I am very thankful for the two... helpers you've provided me.

Spokesman Czarny:
I will ensure that they all receive an excellent report.

???:
......

Spokesman Czarny:
Bless you, sir.

Spokesman Czarny:
...And now, everything is ready.

Spokesman Czarny:
Let us await the beginning of this remarkable competition.

Bald Marcin:
Oh... you're back.

Old Knight:
Didn't they promise no rain? Why'd it still end up raining...?

Old Craftsman:
Hmph... You really can't believe all that crap they put on TV, whether it's news, sports or weather forecasts.

Old Knight:
What about Maria! Ain't the competition today?

Bald Marcin:
I've got food and wine for the both of you.

Bald Marcin:
How was it?

Old Knight:
...Whaddya mean how was it? It's been so long... There's a few less this year too.

Old Knight:
Always less of us to visit the captain's grave.

Old Craftsman:
*Sigh*... She said she'd challenge me to a drinking contest, but she left before the booze was even poured.

Old Knight:
...Forget it, it's all in the past.

Bald Marcin:
Yeah... Who'd have expected that the two of you really stayed single your entire lives for her sake.

Old Knight:
Stop twisting the knife. Out with the wine!

Old Craftsman:
That's right! Enough talk about who's still alive and who's not. We're here to enjoy Maria's performance!

Old Knight:
Cheers, Kowal!

Old Craftsman:
Cheers! V!

Bald Marcin:
......

Bald Marcin:
Here's a great bargain for today, self-service for all drinks. Help me watch the joint.

Old Knight:
Oh? Is it free?

Bald Marcin:
In your dreams.

Old Knight:
Where're you going?

Bald Marcin:
The arena.

Old Craftsman:
Huh? You got ahold of a ticket?

Bald Marcin:
...I got someone to get me one. Tickets nowadays are so overpriced.

Old Craftsman:
That's called business.

Newsboy:
Good day, sir. Here's the midday sports news.

Bald Marcin:
Thanks, kid. Have some milk.

Newsboy:
Nice! Thank you, sir!

Bald Marcin:
The midday sports news, huh——

Bald Marcin:
——Wait, what's this?

Greatmouth Mob:
Welcome! Welcommme, one and allllll, to the Fireblade Arena!

Greatmouth Mob:
The previous match just ended, and the blood of the 'Softwind' Knight still stains the ground. But that's just seasoning for the next battle!

Greatmouth Mob:
No doubt, everybody's here today to witness the splendor of Nearl——! This lassie here may yet be young, but she's already done miracles before our very eyes!

Greatmouth Mob:
We'll have an extra short break. In just ten minutes the temporary duo of Maria Nearl and the Fartooth Knight will——

Greatmouth Mob:
Go against this year's rookies——The alliance of vengeance formed by elites of past years who've failed to enter the Major——The Snowyheel Knightclub!

Greatmouth Mob:
A brand new legend versus the blade of vengeance, in an all-new two-on-two point match. What an unbelievably thrilling sight! The match shall begin soooon!

Zofia:
Maria, your wounds?

Maria:
Right! They're much better now! It's all thanks to you taking care of me!

Zofia:
Alright, I believe you.

Maria:
...Mm!

Zofia:
Hmm, she's late... Fartooth has always been bad with time.

Maria:
It doesn't matter, as long as she makes it here before the match——

Arena Worker:
Miss Maria! Miss Maria Nearl! Please head over to the waiting room and get ready! We're about to begin!

Maria:
Ah. It's about to begin...

Maria:
I'd better get going, Zofia.

Zofia:
...Yes.

Bald Marcin:
...Zofia? Where's Maria?

Zofia:
Marcin? Why're you here?

Bald Marcin:
Oh... I get it. You're still waiting for the Fartooth Knight.

Bald Marcin:
She's not coming.

Zofia:
——What?

Bald Marcin:
Here, the sports page.

Zofia:
Hmm... The Fartooth Knight... seriously injured?!

Bald Marcin:
She got dragged into a fight between knight fans and is now MIA.

Bald Marcin:
At least, that's what the paper says.

Maria:
Wait...she got dragged into a fight?

Zofia:
This must be fake. What kind of fan violence can cause a battle-hardened knight to 'disappear'?

Zofia:
Wait... could it be...

Bald Marcin:
Right now, the question is what do we do for the match?

Bald Marcin:
Something is wrong, Zofia. Just think about it.

Zofia:
Maria has to forfeit! We're out of time, follow me——

Greatmouth Mob:
No rest for the wicked, eh——What? You still think we're letting them rest too much? Come on, we've got to at least act like we're clearing up the battlefield, alright?

Greatmouth Mob:
How many of you are here for Nearl?! How many of you want to see the lovely Nearl?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Speaking for myself here, as someone who's followed every step this super rookie has taken, I've personally watched this prize pool grow to the king's ransom it is today!

Greatmouth Mob:
Let's look at the numbers! Right here, right now, in every city, every village in the country, the crowd watching this fight is in the hundreds of thousands!

Greatmouth Mob:
Who do we have to thank for this?! I'm sure we all know!

Greatmouth Mob:
But! I have some tragic news. The Fartooth Knight suffered heavy injuries in the incident last night and remains missing!

Greatmouth Mob:
Even so! Maria did not choose to forfeit! She steps into a two on one fight completely undeterred!

Greatmouth Mob:
Let me see how much her bravery means to each and every one of you!

Greatmouth Mob:
Presenting——The hottest rookie of this season! Nearl's little knight, Maria Nearl!

Maria:
Oh no, is she not here yet? What should I do...?

Maria:
...No, I can't give up easily. To give up before I've even begun is to disrespect knighthood!

Maria:
Knighthood...yes, knighthood.

Greatmouth Mob:
And on the other side! Two veterans of the Snowyheel Knightclub!

Greatmouth Mob:
Back in their old Knightclubs, they failed to make it into the Major two seasons in a row. Looking for a way out, they finally ended up together in this Knightclub of vengeance!

Greatmouth Mob:
The two members of the Snowyheel Knightclub here today are also well-known knights! They are——

A sudden deafening sound interrupts the announcer.

Male Tourist:
Wait, what's this? Am I seeing things?

Female Tourist:
N-no, there's a weird smell, it's really gross——

Male Tourist:
What's happening?!

Heavy footsteps resound within the twenty thousand seat arena.

As people regain their senses, the entire place remains silent.

Greatmouth Mob:
...Ugh.

A rare occurance in the world of knight sports. In a place that should be packed with vivacious enjoyment, tens of thousands of tourists and spectators hold their breaths, as if listening for the source of the footsteps.

The first to grasp it are VIPs on the grandstand, themselves knights.

Left-hand Knight:
...Is that fog on the field? Originium Arts? Or some special equipment?

Left-hand Knight:
Is there anyone like that in the Snowyheel Knightclub... hmm...?

Left-hand Knight:
...No. Not them. It can't be them.

Left-hand Knight:
That's——

Male Tourist:
......

Female Tourist:
...Those are, ugh, knights?

Old Knight:
——Kowal!

Old Craftsman:
I know! I know! Let's go!

Old Craftsman:
That thing... They're trying to kill Maria!

Platinum:
......

Shadow in the Darkness:
Miss, all teams are in position.

Platinum:
Don't be so nervous. We're here to stop anyone from coming into the arena.

Shadow in the Darkness:
...Yes.

Shadow in the Darkness:
But if we have to stop——

Platinum:
If that Młynar dares try anything... I'll deal with him.

Platinum:
Even though it'll be a huge pain... *Sigh*.

Maria:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
Ugh, so these are the Snowyheel Knightclub's...

Greatmouth Mob:
(Hey! What's going on? The deal for the day was——what? Huh? I can't figure out which of them is——)

Greatmouth Mob:
...The Snowyheel Knightclub's——

Greatmouth Mob:
The 'Corrupted' and 'Withered' Knights!

The expected cheering does not materialize, as silence envelops the audience.

Naturally, the first thought in their minds is that of terror.

However, they soon come to realize that this terror is not for themselves, seated in the audience, but for the young girl who has not yet understood her situation.

This cruelty brings about a striking round of applause.

Tourist:
This... Isn't this too scary?

Tourist:
...Nearl is going to fight these two all by herself?

Tourist:
Hey... Isn't this going to be an amazing show?

Greatmouth Mob:
Alright, then let's start the ma——

Maria:
What——

Withered Knight:
Target hit.

Corrupted Knight:
——Guh!

Maria:
Why so... ugh?!

Corrupted Knight:
Guh... Shield, very durable. Not easy.

Withered Knight:
No matter... Kill her, not difficult.

Greatmouth Mob:
T-They're already exchanging lightning-fast blows before the match has even started! Is this a problem? Of course not! In fact, the match started the moment the knights stepped onto the field!

Greatmouth Mob:
Can Nearl turn this around?! Or will she choose to forfeit early——

Greatmouth Mob:
(What? Not allowed to forfeit...? This... urgh, fine.)

Greatmouth Mob:
——Within each of your hands lies the only way to turn the tide! Invest your money in the pitiful Maria! Maybe those simple little toys will be her key to victory!

Maria:
Ugh... This fog... What is it?

Maria:
My Arts are being suppressed...? My wounds, I can't heal them...?

Maria:
Agh... ouch...

Withered Knight:
Target... Losing ability to resist. Kill her, quickly, like an accident.

Corrupted Knight:
Understood...

Maria:
(No, don't even think of giving up, think of a way to——)

Maria:
(These two Sarkaz...are twins? Their Arts are almost the exact same——!)

Maria:
Then... let's try again!

Maria:
(Eh?)

Greatmouth Mob:
————!

Greatmouth Mob:
T-This is unbelievable! What just happened?! There was a sudden explosion on Maria's body, and the Corrupted Knight followed up with a hit that sent her flying!

Greatmouth Mob:
(Was that Withered? Corrupted? Does it matter anymore?)

Maria:
Nnng——!

Maria:
*Cough* *cough*... *cough*.

Maria:
Blood...? Why... why aren't my Arts working?

Withered Knight:
She is vomiting blood... the Arts have taken effect.

Corrupted Knight:
...Fester, wither, decay... I can smell her death. She cannot escape.

Zofia:
Maria! Forfeit the match! Quickly!

Zofia:
Tsk——

Zofia:
Let me go! Marcin!

Bald Marcin:
Do you want to die with her?!

Zofia:
Mph——

Zofia:
——Dying together is better than Maria dying alone!

Bald Marcin:
Zofia!

Old Knight:
Hurry up, Kowal!

Old Craftsman:
D-Don't run so fast. I'm not a Kuranta——

Platinum:
Sorry, you're not allowed back here.

Old Knight:
You——

Platinum:
Former level-2 campaign knight, Vogelweide. Or should I say, Batbayar.

Platinum:
Your bloodline had you fighting all over the world. You got to run and howl across the prairies of no-man's-land.

Platinum:
And you, senior craftsman of the Craftsman's Guild, Kowal.

Platinum:
Your master was a great blacksmith, respected by the Silverlance Pegasus, and your apprentices are still out there on the front lines even today——

Platinum:
You're both fine, upstanding Kazimierz citizens. Could you just, like, leave?

Old Knight:
...The way you talk ain't nothing like that lil' girl I once met, Platinum.

Platinum:
Hm. You know?

Old Craftsman:
Yes, we know. Of course we know.

Old Craftsman:
We have a personal grudge with some of your bosses.

Platinum:
...Ah, so that's how it is.

Platinum:
I heard that the last Platinum's first job was to assassinate a campaign knight. A really pretty lady, named——

Old Knight & Old Craftsman:
——Shut up.

Platinum:
...Funny. Another leader dying for a woman, in the end.

Platinum:
Maybe working this job too long really does screw with your head. *Sigh* I gotta take a vacation, go traveling...

Old Knight:
Stop wasting time with this crap! Are you the ones messing around with Maria?!

Platinum:
...Keep watching the perimeter. I'll deal with this.

Voice in the darkness:
...Yes.

Old Craftsman:
So you have helpers after all. Why not call them out?

Platinum:
I really don't want to fight you. Can we not just take a step backwards?

Old Knight:
Hah! That's funny. An assassin of the Armorless Union has a soft heart?

Old Knight:
Don't worry, I won't go all out against a young lass like you. When you've given up, we'll be off to rescue Maria——

Old Knight:
——

Old Craftsman:
V——!

Old Knight:
I... I'm fine. Just a scratch. I just didn't expect her to draw her bow that quickly and accurately...

Old Knight:
Yeah, she's done talking. She might be young and immature——

Old Knight:
But she's still above the dregs of the Armorless Union, as the Platinum in that 'one-two-three inverted triangle' of theirs.

Platinum:
Umm... I'll take that as a compliment?

Old Knight:
Get ready, Kowal. Let's see if you've still got it.

Old Craftsman:
Hah! I've long suspected that you're half-blind now, V.

Platinum:
Alright, alright. To you two feisty olds——

Platinum:
——Don't sprain your backs.

Are you leaving now?

Yes, time is tight.

Then... Please be careful. Please, please be very careful.

Don't worry so much... She's still with you, right?

...Yes.

Don't worry, it's fine. I swear——knight's honor.

Y-You don't need to do that. Go on, I believe in you.

Good.

Have a safe journey.

Yes, thank you, Liz.

Maria:
*Cough* *cough*... *cough*.

Maria:
(My wounds are rotting, I can't heal them...! Losing blood... It's cold...)

Maria:
Faster than Mr. Szewczyk... Bigger than Mr. Ingra...

Maria:
These two——

Maria:
——

Should I forfeit?

Maria:
No, just hold on, I can still——

Withered Knight:
...Hit. She should have fainted. You, go.

Corrupted Knight:
Guh... Boring fight... Just smash her head in.

Withered Knight:
Go, quickly!

Corrupted Knight:
......

...The Sarkaz raises his weapon up high.

The sun shines brightly on the girl trying to regain her balance.

Maria:
Ugh, *cough*...

The blood on the ground, the metallic taste in her mouth, ears buzzing, head spinning, the fragrance of dirt after rain.

She tries to support her body with her hands, but gives in to the intense pain.

Maria:
(Old wounds... Hands...!)

Corrupted Knight:
Guh... It's over.

Maria:
Nnng...

Maria lies on the ground, unmoving. This sorrowful scene is reflected in the Sarkaz knight's emotionless eyes.

Suddenly, her vision brightens.

Perhaps the clouds blocking out the sun have dissipated, or perhaps the angle of the sunlight just happened to pass through the building's shade.

The next moment——He hears a thunderous sound. All the cells in his body are warning him, telling him that he must act immediately, that he must strike this defenseless little knight——

His vision brightens even more.

At the same time, the warhammer in his hand flies off, knocked away by someone.
