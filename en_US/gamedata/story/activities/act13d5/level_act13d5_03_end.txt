Maria.

Maria, you are gifted with a pair of pegasian eyes.

Maria. Stand. Come, come forth.

Maria:
—!

Maria:
Ugh?!

Brassrust Knight:
Haa... haah...! You dodged it!

Brassrust Knight:
Very well, I'll let you keep your right hand for just a little longer... Just a little longer.

Maria:
(—These aren't tears... It's sticky... Is it blood?)

Maria:
(...So much blood...)

Maria:
(My heart's beating way too fast... I...)

Brassrust Knight:
Pathetic. The way you swing your weapon is no better than those clowns knocking at the knightly orders' doors. It's laughable.

Brassrust Knight:
Aside from your looks, you are nothing like the Radiant Knight.

Maria:
I... I'm not going to lose!

Brassrust Knight:
Good, now I want to tear your face off even more, you naive noble prick!

Greatmouth Mob:
Ingra! He's chasing her like a storm!

Greatmouth Mob:
This is the most destructive match the Roar Arena has seen this event—! The Butcher of the Field! 'Brassrust' Ingra!

Greatmouth Mob:
Just last month, at the season's first event, poor 'Foehn' got absolutely decimated when the 'Brassrust' kept pummeling him until all of his limbs were crushed!

Greatmouth Mob:
You heard that right! He pummeled with his bare hands! That's definitely not the kind of thing you'd expect a knight carrying a giant axe to do!

Greatmouth Mob:
All eyes are on Maria Nearl here at the Roar Arena today, but is this also where we see her meet a bloody fate? Let us know what you in the audience think!

Greatmouth Mob:
Just like that! 'Brassrust' Ingra! Smear the battlefield with your opponent's blood!

Maria:
Haaahh... haaahhh...

Maria:
(Everything feels so heavy—)

Zofia:
Maria! Just forfeit!

Zofia:
It's one match! There are other chances to score the points you need—!

Zofia:
Maria—!

Auntie Zofia... What are you talking about?

I can't hear you... I feel dizzy... My shield feels so heavy...

What am I... doing... The knight competitions... In the arena...

I need to... open my eyes!

Maria:
Haa... haah...

Brassrust Knight:
Hah! Not a bad counter—That really gives me all the more reason to tear you apart!

Brassrust Knight:
But it'll be no fun if we end this so quickly. I'll smear your blood all over that irritating face... the Radiant Knight's face!

Maria:
We both know... you're at your limit too.

Brassrust Knight:
Hah! A little blood's not going to stop me!

Zofia:
Maria!

???:
Well... I didn't expect Ingra to join the fray so soon...

???:
The National Council let him go early. Hmph, it's like the whole trial was just a sham.

???:
Looks like the corporation coughed up quite a bit of money for him.

???:
Uh huh... the Rose Paper Union's full of money anyway.

???:
It really pisses me off. They're raking in money manipulating public opinion, and other unscrupulous means. That commentator even dared to talk about it openly in a public event.

???:
That just says they aren't afraid.

???:
Yeah, I mean, what do they have to be afraid of?

???:
Well, they have us to be afraid of. Ingra's a bad loser, and I'll absolutely destroy him.

???:
Come on, didn't we agree to let me fight him?

???:
Before that... If the young Nearl doesn't come up with an idea soon, she won't make it out of this in one piece.

Greatmouth Mob:
—Her blood is still in her body! Maria Nearl is much more stubborn than any of us could've thought!

Greatmouth Mob:
What are you waiting for? Doesn't a knight like her just tear at your heartstrings?! Don't forget! Thanks to the generosity of the good-hearted souls at Roar Guards Company, this season's commission fee is just half the normal rate!

Greatmouth Mob:
—Hold on! Something's happening here!

Greatmouth Mob:
The two of them are at a standoff, but Maria's laid down her shield! What is happening here?! Is she hoping to take on Ingra's giant axe with that fragile sword of hers?!

Greatmouth Mob:
There's an enormous difference in both size and power!

Greatmouth Mob:
I can't emphasize this enough—! Commission's half off! Isn't this act of courage worth a few dozen gold coins?!

Maria:
Hahh... haahh...

Brassrust Knight:
...Not bad, kid... A faint light envelops your blade. Is this your last gasp?

Brassrust Knight:
Ha, excellent! I'll rip your arms out, and gag you with your own flesh—

I must win... I must...

What am I doing... Are you meant to kill your opponent in the knight sports?

I don't need my shield... I can't block his axe...

He's hurt too, but he doesn't care... He's like a monster, and he enjoys killing...

How should I... face an enemy like him... An enemy? Isn't he a knight?

A knight...?

'To be a knight is to be the noble light that illuminates the land...'

Maria:
Ahh—!

Maria:
O-Owww...

Zofia:
...Came around finally?

Maria:
Auntie...? What... happened...? Oh.

Zofia:
Do you remember now?

Maria:
...Did I lose?

Zofia:
Yep.

Maria:
......

Zofia:
But Ingra passed out too. Neither of your scores changed at all.

Maria:
I-I see. Phew... That's good—

Zofia:
It's not good! You're hurt!

Zofia:
You should've forfeited the match, going up against an opponent like that! It's just a single match! There are so many ways for us to get those points back!

Zofia:
If you just want to get a title and keep your family's nobility, there's no reason to go that far—

Maria:
I... I never thought about forfeiting, not even once.

Zofia:
Maria!

Zofia:
Do you have any idea how lucky you are to get out of a fight against Ingra in one piece?

Zofia:
If you get hurt again, what good does getting into the Major do to you?!

Maria:
...He's really strong, but...

Zofia:
He's not like the other knights. He comes from an insanely well-off family, and he's only in the competition to hurt people. He lives for it. That's the kind of man Olmer Ingra is.

Zofia:
Maria, if you get hurt like this again, I won't let you fight anymore.

Maria:
I—

Zofia:
Listen to me!

Maria:
F-Fine...

Zofia:
Don't move so much. Get some rest.

Zofia:
That match ended in a draw, but you'll have more and more companies trying to woo you... Marcin and I will turn them down for now. Try to rest up and get better.

Maria:
Yeah...

Maria:
Oh... What's that sword?

Zofia:
...That's the sword I used to carry. I dug it out while you were training the other day.

Maria:
But why are you carrying that sword specifically...?

Maria:
(Even though Zofia's already...)

Zofia:
No reason at all.

Zofia:
But if something bad happens to you because of him, I'll kill him personally, even if it means I'll have to face the National Council.

Maria:
Y-You're way overthinking it...

Maria:
...Can I see it? It kinda looks like it hasn't been used in a while.

Zofia:
No. Get some rest.

Maria:
I might start to rust if I lie in bed all day...

Zofia:
No dice.

Maria:
Please, Zofia! Auntie! I won't ask for anything else! I'll be good and rest up!

Zofia:
*Sigh*... You're becoming more and more like your sister...

Zofia:
Take it. Don't you do anything weird with it. I'm quite fond of it.

Maria:
Eh... This is pretty dusty...

Zofia:
That's the proof that I treasure it!

Bald Marcin:
Where are you two going, carrying all that stuff with you?

Old Knight:
We're going to pay Maria a visit.

Old Craftsman:
I will never forgive Ingra for doing that to our girl...

Bald Marcin:
Spare her the noise and give her some peace and quiet. Zofia will take care of Maria.

Old Craftsman:
Well, I can't just sit around and do nothing! Did you see that last swing Ingra took at her? What happens if that comes back to haunt her?

Old Knight:
We've got an old knight and an old craftsman here. There's bound to be something we can do to help.

Bald Marcin:
What if you run into Młynar instead? Do you think he won't throw you two out the door?

Old Knight:
...That prick wouldn't dare do that to us when his old man was still around, and I know when to run if it comes to it!

Bald Marcin:
...Hmm, the moment the two of them left, I got a new customer. They just might be the albatross around my neck.

Bald Marcin:
Welcome. It's been a while since we've had such a beauty in here. What can I get you?

Platinum:
Hm...

Platinum:
...This one has a pretty name. Let's go with this one, the 'Thorn Tear.'
