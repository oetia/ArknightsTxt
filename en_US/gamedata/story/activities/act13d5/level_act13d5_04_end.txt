Greatmouth Mob:
And eight remain—

Greatmouth Mob:
No, remain? Flip that around, almost half the Knights in the field have already exited due to injuries!

Greatmouth Mob:
Wait—as I was saying that, it looks like 'Hoarhair' has taken a point off 'Springwater'—oh! And 'Drifter' Dorka barges in to pick them off! Now that's what I call productive!

Greatmouth Mob:
Everyone pulling moves on everyone else—this is the glamor of the Fireblade Melee, folks! 24-carat violence!

Maria:
Light, heed me—!

'Gałązka' Knight:
That's all you're capable of? How the hell did you beat Ingra?!

Maria:
Your swordhand... is nothing compared to my auntie's!

'Gałązka' Knight:
Heh, I'll tear you right off that scoreboard, 'Nearl!' Watch this!

Maria:
Ah—behind you!

'Gałązka' Knight:
Uagh—?!

Passing Fan:
Huh?

Passing Fan:
Fancy seeing you again, young Nearl. You've got nowhere to run now.

Greatmouth Mob:
And right after 'Gałązka' comes 'Flametail'! Whoa, way-way-way, how many times has someone come for the Nascent Nearl now? You gotta get your own show, Maria!

Passing Fan:
God, I hate that guy. You're too loud!

Passing Fan:
Anyway, we're running out of foes to fight. Looks like we finally get to size each other up, right?

Maria:
—If all we're doing is measuring, I'll gladly keep you company.

Passing Fan:
Ooh. Not bad. Your eyes got a lot better since you messed up Plastic.

Maria:
......

Passing Fan:
Hup—

One blink. Open. Shut.

Maria:
(Below?!)

Maria:
Gugh—?!

Passing Fan:
Ohh? Dodged that, did you?

Maria:
(What did she do just now...? She wasn't that fast—more like just too dexterous...)

Passing Fan:
Ahh. I see how you held up for so long against Ingra and Szewczyk now... you've got a better foundation than I thought.

Passing Fan:
Whislash taught you all of that, huh?

Maria:
......

Passing Fan:
Nn-huh. You've got a sharp eye too. You know, you learn pretty quick.

Passing Fan:
But—

Maria:
——

Passing Fan:
And now you're down one point. I think me and this format are gonna get along just fine.

Passing Fan:
Keep on like this, and every point you got from capping Plastic's gonna go down the drain, you know that?

Maria:
Hnnfh—!

'Gałązka' Knight:
Urrrrraaahhh! You stinking little squirrel—!

Passing Fan:
Can't you just lie down and bite it for one second?!

'Gałązka' Knight:
Hah! Knocked away your weapon! What are you gonna do now, huh?!

Passing Fan:
Just pick them back up?! Dumbass!

'Gałązka' Knight:
Don't waste your breath! You'll meet your end right here!

Maria:
—Watch out!

'Gałązka' Knight:
What the hell? Arts—no, you can't be, you're not even armed!

'Gałązka' Knight:
No, you... you... you can't be—

Passing Fan:
Good night.

Passing Fan:
Jeez, Louise...! What a good day to earn some free points... Alright, where were we, little Nearl?

Maria:
(Here she comes again—!)

Passing Fan:
D'ja know? Fun fact, I'm Infected.

Maria:
Huh? Infecte—

Passing Fan:
And another point. It is SO easy to distract you.

Maria:
......

Maria:
...But when you said Infected, you weren't just saying it, right?

Maria:
You used your Arts directly just now...

Passing Fan:
Isn't it a shame?

Maria:
You mean?

Passing Fan:
When the Blood Knight took the title, they went 'yeah, we'll officially let Infected be knights'—but when the Radiant Knight got infected, they chased her completely out of Kazimierz. Doesn't that suck?

Maria:
Margaret...

Passing Fan:
Your debut battle was at the Roar Arena, right? All you needed to do was take your paperwork to the Knights Association, sign for your tournament credentials, and then head backstage to gear up...

Passing Fan:
Do you know how much—how MUCH—an Infected has to do to get here?

Passing Fan:
They think it's funny to lock you in a cage of gloompincer first. They think it's funny to make you trample the blood of other Infected, leaving one footprint at a time... they make you win back your humanity, to prove you're a normal, living, breathing person.

Passing Fan:
Welcome to the bottom line. They weren't gonna give the Infected any respect for a single second. 'Just throw them into the machine. Make them one more symbol of our progress.'

Passing Fan:
...Don't you think I have the right to hate it?

Maria:
......

Passing Fan:
Our sights are set on every noble knight who thinks her opinion means the world... we'll go under their own rules, cut them right where it hurts.

Passing Fan:
Honestly, I'm not here to knock you out of the game... after all, I respect the Radiant Knight from the bottom of my heart. Being Infected doesn't sway me there.

Passing Fan:
Let's call the points I've already taken a fee, and here's a lesson on behalf of 'Whislash.' From the match where you beat Ingra, I can tell you still don't understand what the actual significance of the Major is.

Passing Fan:
Blind enthusiasm? Riding your own efforts, tuning all the warning signs out? In any ideal scenario, worst is you'd fall flat on your face. But this is the Major. That'll kill you.

Passing Fan:
Keep it up. Whatever.

Maria:
...Wait.

Passing Fan:
Huh?

Passing Fan:
Light? Same thing as when you beat Ingra...

Maria:
—Hiyaah!

Passing Fan:
Are you kidding?!

Maria:
That's one point back, Flametail!

Passing Fan:
Goddamn. Didn't think you were so stupid thirsty for it—

Passing Fan:
—But hey, now you look like the Radiant Knight's sister!

We step back, put some distance between us. Our blades face off again.

...This feels strange.

We just talked a little, simple as that. Facing her, I can't feel any of the same immense, nauseating pressure Szewczyk and Ingra had... is it just because of her nature?

Yet she's so strong. Ngh. And fast. And masterful.

Passing Fan:
You're smiling? You're that confident?

Maria:
...Am I?

Passing Fan:
Eh. Give it a try and you'll find out.

Maria:
Alright, then...

Greatmouth Mob:
Aaaaaaaand—! Tiiiiiiiime!

We stop in our tracks as soon as we hear the announcer.

By just a hair—by just the slightest hair, we could've been touching the other's armor.

Lightly, like she's just messing with me, 'Flametail' taps against my shield.

'Flametail' Knight:
Maybe you'd have taken one more point off me here. Maybe not. Who can say, Maria?

Maria:
Could've been two, maybe.

'Flametail' Knight:
Hahahaha—you know, from the stands, it's hard to tell just how fiercely stubborn you are, Nearlie.

Greatmouth Mob:
And our refs are finished judging! At the end of this free-for-all, only four remained standing!

Greatmouth Mob:
Yo, audience! Here's the deciding moment your wallets have been waiting for! Even if your favorite knight started out getting knocked around six ways from Sunday, don't you lose the light! The Arena's here to welcome you back any time!

Greatmouth Mob:
Fourth place! Earning ten points, the arena was his to walk, and he avoided almost any direct battle! Our survivor with smarts, 'Gałązka' Daniel!

Greatmouth Mob:
Third place! Hunted by the whole arena since the word go, and without a moment to breathe, she might be our biggest winner on the points exchange tonight! Our dainty, charming independent knight, Maria Nearl!

Greatmouth Mob:
Second place! In the starting skirmishes, he beat three knights with his own hands! He made the arena's corner his own with his tremendous shields! The walking fortress, 'Limestone' Marko!

Greatmouth Mob:
And our champion tonight, with twenty-two fresh points to her name! A near uninterrupted combo of victories! The super-rookie who never drags her feet—'Flametail' Sona!

Greatmouth Mob:
And that win of hers means a mean mountain of money, so let's make some mega noise—! Coming up! We'll be announcing the lottery draws for each prize pool! Tonight, while the knights strike the sky, the audience strikes it big! All at the Fireblade Arena!

Spokesman Czarny:
Ah, welcome, dear Miss.

Spokesman Czarny:
Having the fortune to meet the youngest ever to join the Kazimierz Armorless Union, the mighty Platinum, I admit that I, humble Czarny, am profoundly terrified.

Platinum:
Uh, can we not with the niceness, Spokesman, sir. You're the ones who yelled for me anyway, right?

Spokesman Czarny:
Hardly, hardly. I'm merely the General Chamber's mouthpiece, working as its directors will it. How could I dare think to command the mighty Platinum?

Platinum:
You say that, but, like, two of them are just busy and then the three above make everyone else do all the work forever, right?

Platinum:
Ugh, this sucks... I hate overtime. I already had enough work before you called me... Seriously, I wanna go on vacation to Sami once the Major's done.

Spokesman Czarny:
As long as the General Chamber agrees, I can arrange you a Sami countryside villa right this moment.

Platinum:
I gotta wait until work's over, thoughhh—

Platinum:
—What do you want the Armorless Union to do?

Spokesman Czarny:
We have many problems on our hands, dear Miss. Infected out of line, curious rumors, knights drawing a little too much attention...

Spokesman Czarny:
But I trust that at the nod of the mighty Platinum of the Armorless Union, none of these will be a problem at all.

Zofia:
I'm back! Where's the chef? Let's get him going!

Zofia:
He's got a big meal to make tonight, and Maria'll be here soon... she needs a feast and then some! Don't say it was me who called for it.

Servant:
Madam Zofia, you have a guest. One who claims urgent business with you.

Zofia:
A guest? Now?

Zofia:
They can wait until Maria's back—

Corporate Employee:
Ah... apologies, Zofia, for coming uninvited...

Zofia:
You're the one who... *sigh*... I remember you had your own little company, and then you broke into my place like this, thinking you'd make off with all my sponsorship rights.

Zofia:
Well, out with it. What now?

Corporate Employee:
I, uh, there's some... I have some info here... probably some of it's rumors...

Corporate Employee:
But don't tell anyone! True or false, the event plans here are all top, top secret...

Corporate Employee:
But I think you've guessed that already... just treat this as me paying you back... and, uh, I hope things turn out well for you...

Corporate Employee:
I haven't seen a good knight in a long time... who had a happy ending.
