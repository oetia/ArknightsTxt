Why do I want to join the Armorless Union?

What a weird question. This is your organization, old man. What's there to explain?

So, does this count as my interview? I heard all the companies around town do stuff like this now. Are we going to interview every new recruit from now on? Should I start calling you 'Boss'?

Stop being such a pain in the ass.

The way I see it, there's no difference between a hitman agency and any other business. Show up to work, do some overtime, then make that someone else's problem.

If I had to give you a reason, then it's probably for the extra cash. Sure as hell beats what I make from hunting fowlbeasts.

It's the same stuff anyways—you aim, you shoot. Of course the higher paying job's gonna motivate you more.

Isn't that right, boss? After all, everyone just wants to live the good life.

The Blood Knight:
The Armorless Union's hitmen. How did you people find this place?

Monique:
Does that really matter at this point?

Roy:
Celebrities such as yourself naturally attract attention with their every move.

Roy:
While you've done your due diligence, good sir, how should I put this... We're hardly the only ones who can track you down.

The Blood Knight:
......

Roy:
There are plenty of people who have it in for you. Beating them all to the punch was no small feat.

Roy:
Time is of the essence. I do hope you can trust our good intentions.

The Blood Knight:
...Trust you?

The Blood Knight:
The Armorless Union, speaking to me of trust? If that's a joke, I'm not laughing.

Roy:
When necessary, we are also capable of NOT being Armorless Union.

Monique:
......

The Blood Knight:
Hitman, is this the reason you sent your subordinates to die by my hand?

The Blood Knight:
Are you planning to—

Roy:
Shh. Some things are better kept to yourself.

Roy:
A man as wise as you surely understands this.

The Blood Knight:
......

Roy:
Do us a little favor, and you'll earn yourself an out. It's a pretty good deal if you ask me.

Roy:
You scratch our back, we scratch yours. So how about it?

The Armorless Union's Lazurite rank. How about it? Sounds pretty powerful, doesn't it?

Honestly, the pay isn't half-bad either. In a way, it's not too different from being a competition knight. You earn your keep by putting your life on the line.

You don't get paid the big bucks without taking a few risks, right?

That said, after more than a decade in the business, it's time to hang up the hat.

'Quit while you're ahead.' The simplest truth to live by. Why swim against the current of the era? There are more stable sources of income, so why burn your life away?

Bring your ship back to port when the time's right.

How could being someone else's underling possibly feel as good as being your own boss?

Monique:
The surgery is scheduled in two hours. Be sure to show up on time.

Monique:
Starting tomorrow, your new name will be Joel Tyrell. And in two days, the company will put in a word for us, so don't mess it up.

Monique:
Also... the General Chamber's people don't seem to completely buy that we died along with the Blood Knight. Not yet, anyway.

Monique:
Tch, the Armorless Union is already preparing to select the next Lazurites before the investigators have even left.

Monique:
In other words, lay low and spare us any unnecessary trouble until this all blows over.

Monique:
...Hey, are you even listening?

Roy:
Huh? Oh, yes, of course.

Roy:
Ma'am, I'd like to have the most expensive meal set.

Roy:
No need for a bag, I'll be eating here. Oh, and make it extra spicy, please!

Roy:
Okay, so what were you saying, Monique?

Monique:
...Go die in a ditch.

Roy:
What an awful thing to say. Why, if I died, poor Mrs. Tyrell would end up a widow—

Roy:
She sure hung up fast.

Roy:
(Seems like everything's going smoothly. Even if the Board of Directors has its doubts, it's already too late. As for the Blood Knight... If he knows what's good for him, he'll keep his head down and not make a mess of things.)

Roy:
(After all, everyone is too busy looking out for number one. Nobody will lose sleep over a couple of 'tools' going missing.)

Roy:
(I probably don't have to worry about Darksteel either. All that's left is a face transplant and a new identity...)

Roy:
(......)

Roy:
(Guess I'll be kissing goodbye to this handsome mug then.)

Roy:
(Who knows how I'll look when it's done, but somehow I doubt I'll be quite as gorgeous.)

Roy:
(Alas, what a pity.)

The former Lazurite stands on the street, concealed beneath the shadows of the neon lights.

He lifts his hands to pat his cheeks while aimlessly looking out at the bright city lights.

The most recent news highlights are being broadcast on the big screen on the side of a skyscraper.

All the other screens dotting the cityscape, large and small, play roughly the same thing, their clashing noises and flashing lights enough to make one a bit dizzy.

Television:
The Blood Knight was attacked by unknown assailants in his secluded countryside home. There were traces of an intense struggle, and it has been confirmed that the blood left at the scene belongs to the former champion himself.

Television:
The bodies of the attackers were also found at the scene.

Television:
Experts have commented that it is highly unlikely that the Blood Knight survived such a fierce battle, which is consistent with the large quantities of blood found.

Television:
The leading theory at the moment is that our former champion, weakened after his battle with the Radiant Knight, exhausted the last of his strength and passed away along with his assailants.

Television:
For more information, please stay tuned to our follow-up program! The truth behind the attack on the Blood Knight!

An Infected Knight:
Those bastards! What 'truth'? It's all a bunch of baloney!

An Infected Knight:
How could the Blood Knight be defeated by mere assassins? Not a chance in hell! He's probably just laying low because he doesn't want those media bloodsuckers bothering him over an injury! They only care about the next scoop!

An Infected Knight:
And damn the whole lot of those shameless murderers! Gutter-dwelling pests! The Blood Knight would never go down like this!

A Corporate Employee:
Calm down, you can say what you want, just stop flailing your arms like— Yowch, that's my head!

An Infected Knight:
...Huh?

An Infected Knight:
S-Sorry, I got a bit too worked up there. You alright?

A Corporate Employee:
Gaah... I'm fine... I guess this just isn't my lucky day.

A Corporate Employee:
Hey, you over there! Yeah, you! You didn't get hit, did you?

Roy:
......

A Corporate Employee:
You alright, man? He didn't hit you in the head too?

Roy:
Uh... Huh? Sorry, err, were you talking to me?

A Corporate Employee:
Who else is there? There's only the three of us squatting by the food stall in the middle of the night.

Roy:
Hmm, I suppose so. I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine. I was just in shock after hearing the news.

An Infected Knight:
The news is nothing but a load of shit!

An Infected Knight:
Those carrion-lickers only care about the scent of blood and death. They don't give a damn about whether the Blood Knight lives or dies. They don't know a goddamn thing, which is why they can run their mouths like that!

Roy:
'After being defeated by the Radiant Knight, the former champion yada yada!'

Roy:
Tsk tsk. As long as you pick a good clickbait title, you can easily farm a few days' worth of ad revenue. No one with a bit of curiosity can resist. It's just the latest way to make a quick buck these past two days.

An Infected Knight:
He shouldn't be this... this token of consumerism!

Roy:
Well said. You're exactly right.

A Corporate Employee:
Our company does some business with the knight competitions. I ran into him a few times while following the project, but our holdings went down the drain as soon as the news came out.

A Corporate Employee:
*sigh*... Personally, I'm a big fan, so I hope he's alright.

An Infected Knight:
...Hmph. That's more than enough reason to treat you to a drink then!

A Corporate Employee:
Huh?

An Infected Knight:
I mean, as an apology for what just happened.

An Infected Knight:
How about it? Or are you too scared to have a drink with an Infected?

A Corporate Employee:
But I have work tomorrow...

A Corporate Employee:
......

A Corporate Employee:
Well, whatever. I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

A Corporate Employee:
You pick the place then.

An Infected Knight:
Heh, I like your guts. How about you then? Wanna all go together?

Roy:
Me?

Roy:
Actually, I have some things I need to attend to soon—

Roy:
...Still, fate has brought us together, and kindness is hard to find these days. So, why not? Lead the way.

An Infected Knight:
Great! Follow me!

Roy:
Pwah! Cheers!

A Corporate Employee:
Cheers!

An Infected Knight:
...Wrap it up, you two. I'm not made of money, you know.

A Corporate Employee:
Actually, uhh, I recognize you. You're the one who competed today, that, uhh—

A Corporate Employee:
Ironwrist Knight!

A Corporate Employee:
Wow, I can't believe I got my head smacked by Ironwrist Knight's iron wrist...

Roy:
Ahahaha! That's gotta be worth at least a point!

An Infected Knight:
C'mon, I already apologized, didn't I?

A Corporate Employee:
Ahh!

A Corporate Employee:
Too bad about today, you almost got the win. If only the other side didn't get that supply pack!

A Corporate Employee:
I bet on you, you know!

An Infected Knight:
...Really? Why would you do that?

A Corporate Employee:
Because the odds were good. Why else?

An Infected Knight:
Oh... Makes sense...

An Infected Knight:
But just so you know, you shouldn't bet on Infected knights next time. They won't let us win.

An Infected Knight:
I gave it my all, but still failed. I doubt the people behind the scenes are very happy with me, after my last showing.

Roy:
Woah, that sounds awful.

An Infected Knight:
If only I had the Blood Knight's skills...

Roy:
He still lost to the Radiant Knight though. Er, sorry, shouldn't have brought that up.

An Infected Knight:
......

An Infected Knight:
By the way, what do YOU do?

A Corporate Employee:
Are you some sort of knight too?

Roy:
Nothing of the sort. I'm just a hunter from the sticks who occasionally stops by the big city. I usually hunt fowlbeasts, and can sometimes even turn a profit if they manage to fetch a good price.

Roy:
But it's been rough these days, so I've been thinking about how to make it big in the city.

A Corporate Employee:
Like becoming a competition knight? You can make a lot of quick cash if you manage to win.

Roy:
Nah, forget it. I don't have what it takes to be a knight anyway.

Roy:
I'm no good at fighting.

An Infected Knight:
You've got a good head on your shoulders then. The knight competitions may be glamorous, but only a small handful of us make any real money. Not the kind of thing you want to be worrying about.

An Infected Knight:
Heck, I wouldn't be doing this either, if I had a choice.

Roy:
Life has a way of messing with us all, brother.

An Infected Knight:
You said it. Back then, all I ever thought about was how much better life would be in the big city.

An Infected Knight:
If I could go back in time, I'd tell myself from a few years back to just forget about Kawalerielki. Should've stayed home and worked an honest job.

An Infected Knight:
I'd rather spend my entire life farming than... doing whatever I'm doing now.

A Corporate Employee:
Agreed, only a tiny minority are able to make good money.

A Corporate Employee:
But even then, what the best paid competition knight earns is nothing compared to the real profit that the companies behind them are making... *hic*.

Roy:
You've had too much to drink, my man.

A Corporate Employee:
Naww, I'm totally sober!

A Corporate Employee:
Whaddya think... If I get infected, you think I'll get the day off tomorrow?

An Infected Knight:
......

Roy:
Maybe. But forget tomorrow, you'll never have to go to work again.

A Corporate Employee:
Just pretend I didn't say anything... *hic*. Damn, maybe I am drunk after all.

A Corporate Employee:
Sorry, my head's starting... to spin...

An Infected Knight:
Fine. Seems like you really are out of it, so I'll restrain myself and not beat the shit out of you.

An Infected Knight:
Just don't ever crack a joke like that again... 'Cause if you do, you're taking a trip to the hospital to get stitches for your nose.

A Corporate Employee:
Eep... It won't happen again.

A Corporate Employee:
To be honest, I always wanted to be a knight, ever since I was a little kid.

A Corporate Employee:
Not a competition knight, mind you. Something much older... The kind my grandpa's generation really looked up to.

Roy:
You mean like those campaign knights that entered the city not too long ago?

A Corporate Employee:
Yeah, I know I don't have the skills for that... *sigh*.

Roy:
Look at it this way, their way of fighting is totally outdated. What can you accomplish these days with brute strength alone?

An Infected Knight:
Sure, nobody's arguing with that. But... We've got to fight, like it or not.

An Infected Knight:
Phew... Boss, pour me another one!

Roy:
If you ask me, everyone wants a better life. And the best way to do that is to get into business.

A Corporate Employee:
You want to get into the business world?

Roy:
Uh, yeah, I guess? Preferably a large corporation. The nine-to-five, cubicle sort. But y'know, being a salesman doesn't sound half-bad either. I think I'd be pretty good at it.

Roy:
I heard big companies give bonuses to outstanding employees too. What could be better than earning a stable salary?

An Infected Knight:
Haha, when you put it like that...

A Corporate Employee:
You're too naive!

Roy:
Huh?

A Corporate Employee:
Working in a corporation isn't as easy as you think.

Roy:
Hmm... Well, it's just a pipe dream anyway. Everyone knows it's tough getting into a good company.

A Corporate Employee:
True, it's tough, but that's still the easy part. Getting in is just the beginning.

A Corporate Employee:
The problem is, once you're in, you can't get out. That's the hard part.

A Corporate Employee:
......

A Corporate Employee:
Today, I... actually ditched work. I didn't show up.

A Corporate Employee:
I originally wanted to take some time off, but I'm out of vacation days for the year, so I didn't even bother applying.

Roy:
You were gone the whole day and nobody even bothered to call you?

A Corporate Employee:
My phone's dead. Forgot to charge it last night.

Roy:
Good man.

An Infected Knight:
Are you sure that's not going to be a problem?

A Corporate Employee:
It's a problem all right. A big problem.

An Infected Knight:
...Scratch what I said earlier. Maybe you're a little TOO gutsy.

A Corporate Employee:
Hah... Haha... Is this what you'd call having guts?

A Corporate Employee:
My tongue's completely numb, my stomach's empty, and my brain's faring about as well.

A Corporate Employee:
Err, no, I just drank a whole bunch, so there's alcohol in my stomach and water in my head.

An Infected Knight:
What the hell are you on about?

Roy:
Quite the unique saying you came up with there. I like it.

A Corporate Employee:
That said, I feel pretty good now that I can't hear my ringtone... At least I can fool myself into thinking everything's fine.

Roy:
With all due respect, that feeling won't last forever.

Roy:
As soon as you charge your phone... Sheesh, I don't even want to think about it.

A Corporate Employee:
...Then let's not. I'm starting to get the chills again.

An Infected Knight:
Even I'm starting to feel sick to my stomach.

A Corporate Employee:
Whatever, I've made my peace with it. There's no shortage of grunts like me. You've got the more experienced old hands, and the more gung-ho young guns. No point delaying the inevitable.

A Corporate Employee:
I'm just worn out, man... I just wanna take a day off where I don't have to worry about anything.

A Corporate Employee:
If I'm really gonna get fired over this, then so be it. At least that spares me from all the agonizing over not being able to make up my mind.

Roy:
You really do have nerves of steel. You're not afraid at all?

A Corporate Employee:
...Can't you tell I'm joking? Of course I'm afraid. I still haven't paid off my mortgage.

A Corporate Employee:
So I'm gonna head home and pull an all-nighter writing a report for the head of the department about how I was in a coma all day from a serious illness, and accidentally broke my phone.

Roy:
That... might be a bit of a stretch.

An Infected Knight:
Just a bit.

A Corporate Employee:
Who cares if it's true or not? All that matters is having an excuse to step down.

A Corporate Employee:
Alright, that's enough for today. No more drinking.

An Infected Knight:
Boss, give me the tab... Tch, you two sure know how to take advantage of a guy's hospitality. Picking all the expensive drinks, eh?

Roy:
I do appreciate it. Ahh, what a rare treat, to enjoy a friend's hospitality on one of my few trips to the city.

Roy:
......

Roy:
To show my thanks, can I offer you a suggestion?

An Infected Knight:
What, me?

Roy:
Why don't you spend the night here at the bar? I took a look and it's going to be open all night, with plenty of customers.

Roy:
And tomorrow morning, find another place with lots of people. Try to keep your head down in the crowd.

A Corporate Employee:
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

Roy:
That's all I have to say. I'll be off now.

A Corporate Employee:
He's gone just like that, huh? Didn't even care to elaborate.

A Corporate Employee:
Well, I'd better get going too. What about you? Are you going to listen to him and drink all night?

An Infected Knight:
I...

Later, the old man told me that he's a Darksteel, and that I might be cut out to become a Lazurite.

He may have been as cold and shady as his rank, but I don't think there's anything particularly blue about me. Oh, not that I'm trying to argue with you, boss. Lazurite suits me just fine.

When the old man picked me up—well, I won't say that, since I was doing perfectly fine by myself and didn't need to be 'picked up.'

Basically, I had just hunted two fowlbeasts at the time. Scalded off the plumage, bled them out, and had them ready for eating after some time over the fire pit.

They came out pretty good, and the old man ate a fowlbeast and a half all by himself. Left me with two heads, a pair of claws, and one leg.

After he finished, he started talking like one of those high-and-mighty folks out of the storybooks:

Even without a teacher or any tools, you're still able to hunt these slippery fowlbeasts. They can be difficult even for experienced hunters your age. You've got a natural talent.

How about it, child? Want to live the good life?

—Of course. How could I not?

An Infected Knight:
......

An Infected Knight:
I must've been drunk as hell too. Ended up wasting all that time because I somehow believed what he said.

An Infected Knight:
The sun's almost up... Better start heading back.

An Infected Knight:
Ugh... It's so cold.

An Infected Knight:
So this is what Kawalerielki looks like at this hour. There's hardly anyone around, the trash everywhere hasn't been cleaned up yet, and there are discarded knight posters all over the ground.

An Infected Knight:
Hah, people are all trash...

An Infected Knight:
—Who's there?!

An Infected Knight:
You people are...

Armorless Union Assassin:
Ironwrist Knight.

Armorless Union Assassin:
By refusing to cooperate with the General Chamber, you've impeded the path for others.

Armorless Union Assassin:
The Blood Knight can no longer protect you.

This whole deal with pawning my life off to them... The more time passes, the more I see things clearly.

The knights are commodities they hoard inside their warehouses. The assassins are weapons they wield. And what of public opinion? It's their best tool for manipulation, and they've studied it thoroughly.

Money and power. In Kazimierz, these two things are often inextricably linked.

Hey, I'm not saying you have to become a tycoon or anything, but look, if you want to live a better life, you have to rub shoulders with those people.

Most people are fine climbing over others, one rung at a time. But when will you ever be free from someone else's control?

So just don't think about it too much. If you're privileged enough, just try to live a better, more comfortable life.

At least now, I won't be asked to take someone's life over the phone anymore. If something goes wrong, getting hurt is the least of our worries. We'll need a good excuse to pull the wool over the boss's eyes, right?

Monique:
Alright, you can open your eyes now. You look fine.

Roy:
...Nngh...

Monique:
If you keep stroking your face like that, I'm going to make you need another one.

Roy:
Egads, Monique. I shudder at the thought.

Roy:
Having bandages all over my face is... Hmm, how should I put this, new and exciting?

Monique:
Donna. Donna Tyrell. And you're Joel Tyrell.

Donna:
You'd better not mess it up again after the doctor comes back.

Joel:
Oh right, our titles have changed too. We're husband and wife now, right?

Donna:
......

Joel:
Oh, are you blushing?

Donna:
Did they carve out your eyeballs?

Joel:
No need to be so hostile. While this arrangement might be a bit... Mm, well, it's fine.

Joel:
Oh, and don't worry, you're just as easy on the eyes as before.

Donna:
...So they definitely carved out your eyeballs.

A Doctor:
I see you're awake now. How are you doing?

A Doctor:
You chose to go with the accelerated program. Though Originium Arts can speed up the process so you won't need multiple surgeries, there are still corresponding risks.

A Doctor:
You won't be able to remove the bandages for a while, and I'd suggest returning for a follow-up once a month to ensure the most stable results.

Joel:
Thank you. I feel great already.

Joel:
But I don't think the follow-ups will be necessary.

A Doctor:
Urk...

Joel:
We'll figure something out on our own. Thank you for your hard work, doctor.

Donna:
That was sudden. You're gonna have to figure out how to get rid of the body on your own.

Joel:
I didn't have a choice. Nobody can be allowed to know about this. I could've chosen my words better, but I meant what I said.

Joel:
Dead men tell no tales.

Joel:
By the way, did you hear about what the General Chamber did to a group of Infected knights who had been following the Blood Knight?

Joel:
I ran into one of 'em last night, just to make sure.

Donna:
I've heard a thing or two. But it's none of my business.

Donna:
And I suggest you keep your shiny new nose out of it too. Don't forget, we've got nothing to do with the Armorless Union now.

Joel:
Heh, I suppose you're right.

Joel:
It's none of our business now.

Joel:
Alright, then we're about to start a brand new chapter of our lives. What's the plan? If we're going to sell stuff... are we really going to run a business?

Donna:
Even if you wanted to, Darksteel would never let you.

Donna:
It'd already be a miracle if you didn't scare off all our customers.

Joel:
Please, do I even have the talent to mess anything up? We have everything we could ever want now, but I still need something to kill the time.

Donna:
You've got time to kill?

Joel:
Kind of. You in the mood to go hunting, just the two of us? We can go buy a villa out in the countryside. I'll teach you how to hunt fowlbeasts—nobody's better than me.

Joel:
Ha, hunting for sport. Never could've imagined that back when I was scraping by in the woods.

Joel:
I've simply never had the free time. But now I've got nothing BUT free time, so I might as well treat myself.

Donna:
Seems like all that free time fried your brain then. You can go by yourself.

Donna:
I'm going on vacation, preferably some place nice like Dossoles or Siesta. You won't catch me dead in the boonies.

Donna:
Seriously, after all the work it took to make this day possible, you're just reminiscing about your childhood?

Donna:
What are you planning?

Joel:
...Honestly, who knows?

Joel:
If I can live a better life, I'll try to do exactly that. No need to sweat the details.

Donna:
...If your brain malfunctions and you decide to go live in a cave or whatever, you might as well transfer all your assets to me first. I'll send you my bank account number when we get back.

Joel:
Haha, if something happens to me, you'd inherit everything I own anyway, just from our legal status.

Donna:
Good point. Might as well speed up the process then.

Joel:
How cruel. Anyway, enough of that. After I tie up some loose ends, how about we go on that vacation I suggested? Give it a thought, alright?

Joel:
Wherever you decide to go, why not make it a team effort?
