Boatman:
Still a little chilly, so early in the morning.

Boatman:
Typical of Shangshu's weather. Cool now, hot and hotter by noon. It's a fickle one.

???:
There is rule to heat and cold. I presume Shangshu's folk have long since accustomed.

Boatman:
Indeed. But seeing the rain come harder lately, I'm worried the weather's about to turn.

Boatman:
Best it isn't some blistering cold or heat, so the people have a little time to adapt.

Grand Tutor:
The season is here. Shocking turns come as granted.

Grand Tutor:
Boatman, may you ferry me?

Boatman:
By all means. Where to?

Grand Tutor:
Across the river.

Boatman:
Fine by me. How should this river of yours be crossed, in your view?

Boatman:
Which route? Are you hurrying or taking your time?

Grand Tutor:
What difference is there?

Boatman:
If you're in a rush, and time is short, I'll ferry fast. We'll reach the other shore without much effort.

Grand Tutor:
So what if I am not?

Boatman:
Then we'll have to fix up some wine and sides before we cross.

Boatman:
The wine's warmed aboard the boat, and we come from upstream to the crossing, staying to the side as we drift down. You can gaze on the city, and see the fields being planted. Fine scenery.

Grand Tutor:
Not half-bad.

Boatman:
Then so it'll be. I'll warm the wine now.

Grand Tutor:
You're deft at business.

Boatman:
So this line of work goes. Always a need to play it by ear.

Boatman:
Few sirs like you would turn down viewing more of old Shangshu City. If it's not for the city, then it's for the people.

Grand Tutor:
Quite.

Grand Tutor:
The people deserve to be viewed. If not, then it's been a wasted journey.

Grand Tutor:
I imagine Liang Xun has informed you—he is to go with me this evening to return to the capital. The way out of Shangshu will be led by you.

Boatman:
He did inform me.

Boatman:
Don't blame us. Mr. Liang's leaving in a rush here. Us folk can't help but be worried.

Boatman:
Our Magistrate... As good as a parent to us, we say, but he's still young in the end. Resembles the nephews of our own at times. There's concern to be had.

Grand Tutor:
Liang Xun has the talent, and the resolve. Should he withstand, he will be famed and recognized.

Boatman:
And what if he doesn't?

Boatman:
—*sigh* No, never mind, I shouldn't ask. If you want to see Shangshu, just come with me.

Boatman:
Only shame is, young Lee's still searching for someone right now. He'll be hard-pressed to meet Mr. Liang this evening if he wants, I think.

Miss Ning:
'Tis still quite cool. 'Tis lucky we are not cold ourselves, with the tea warm.

Miss Ning:
Official affairs inundate you, my Lord. What brings you here so early?

Liang Xun:
I agreed to watch the play with you.

Liang Xun:
Cloak in some more layers. Mind the chill.

Miss Ning:
When did we agree this? All I had said was to come if you were free.

Liang Xun:
And I'm free today.

Miss Ning:
Liar. Your work is surely a mountain of bother, with the Grand Tutor so urgent in handing it over to you... Could it be, my Lord, you did not sleep last night?

Liang Xun:
*cough* I did get a little shuteye.

Liang Xun:
You're also early to rise today, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
I guessed the headstrong Liang would come at first light despite all exhortation, and so was awaiting you the whole time.

Liang Xun:
That. Hm. I...

Miss Ning:
Your tea cup is empty. Pass it to me.

Liang Xun:
Thank you.

Miss Ning:
'Tis but a cup of tea. Need we such formalities between us?

Miss Ning:
'Tis pleasant, to be able to sit here in this mountain, drinking tea, shaking oneself awake.

Miss Ning:
The refreshments at this shop are quite fine too... the shaobing, sesame cake, and—

Liang Xun:
Sweet fritters.

Liang Xun:
You've lauded this place before.

Miss Ning:
Ah, and you remembered?

Liang Xun:
Mm. Being that you're fond, I take note.

Miss Ning:
Everything of Shangshu is fine, save the slight strength in flavor. Lucky that the pastries by and large are tender and sweet still. They fit my palate.

Miss Ning:
*sigh* Your estate stews were very spicy at first, my Lord. Though, they have been considerably better since.

Miss Ning:
I could not pick up my chopsticks before needing to seek water. How very sorry for me.

Liang Xun:
The estate has spice-remedying decoction available at all times.

Liang Xun:
Miss Ning, your home...

Miss Ning:
The waterways of the south. We are no great spice eaters.

Liang Xun:
I apologize for the trouble.

Miss Ning:
What matter is it? We all must adapt at some point.

Liang Xun:
So you say, though it's not so easily done.

Miss Ning:
'Tis not hard, should you intend to.

Miss Ning:
We all must adapt at some point.

Liang Xun:
Verily.

Miss Ning:
You have mentioned you are native to Shangshu, my Lord?

Liang Xun:
I am.

Liang Xun:
I left home at an early age, and only returned in recent years. You know as much, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
I have heard you make mention.

Miss Ning:
Is it then that you met your Lungmen friend, in your period away?

Liang Xun:
Yes.

Liang Xun:
I knew nothing back then, left to forge my own way, made no shortage of friends, believed the spirit of youth could conquer everything, accomplish anything...

Liang Xun:
I did plenty of clownishly ridiculous, foolish things.

Miss Ning:
'Tis no foolish thing to make friends.

Miss Ning:
My Lord, the friend you have made is a fine one.

Liang Xun:
...I was simply lucky to.

Miss Ning:
Were it not for such urgent affairs, 'twould only be right we bid your friend on a true, proper tour of Shangshu, being the hosts that we should.

Miss Ning:
'Twould also be more chance to hear some anecdotes of your past, my Lord. Who knows how different you are these days?

Liang Xun:
I have never changed.

Liang Xun:
No...

Liang Xun:
Maybe I have changed some. But...

Miss Ning:
Hm?

Liang Xun:
What I set out to do, for these common peoples... has never changed.

Miss Ning:
......

Liang Xun:
When the Grand Tutor last evening proposed I accompany him to the capital... I didn't want to accept, at first.

Miss Ning:
You denounce me for accepting in your place?

Liang Xun:
No. I hardly could.

Liang Xun:
I should not have hesitated in the first place. I should be thanking you, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
So long as you do not blame me. I understand you are uneasy for Shangshu, as can others, but the Grand Tutor's word is a different story.

Miss Ning:
He keeps no mediocrity for company. What he assigns are but the most rugged, hard-fought opportunities.

Miss Ning:
I believe, should my perception of you not be faulty, that if you had refused in a moment of hesitation, you would surely regret it in time.

Liang Xun:
I understand... I apologize for worrying you.

Miss Ning:
......

Miss Ning:
...Heheh.

Liang Xun:
Miss Ning...?

Miss Ning:
Ah, no, nothing. I just suddenly imagined...

Miss Ning:
If you had then and there earnestly, unreservedly agreed to leave, I fear I would perhaps have been quite angry.

Liang Xun:
Ahem. You're joking, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
I am certainly not joking.

Liang Xun:
*cough* *cough* *cough*.

Miss Ning:
In so little time, the sun has come up.

Miss Ning:
My Lord, are you enjoying this play?

Liang Xun:
It's not bad.

Miss Ning:
Then shall you be descending the mountain sooner?

Liang Xun:
No.

Liang Xun:
I'll watch another while.

Liang Xun:
Miss Ning, watch another while.

Miss Du:
Okay, come on, Dad! Stop looking at it!

Miss Du:
Why? What's even the point? It's just a travel itinerary! Me and the guys already hashed it out! We're leaving once everything's packed!

Miss Du:
And I have a whole ROOM of stuff that still needs packing, so!

Innkeeper Zheng:
What's the rush? Let me look over it again...

Innkeeper Zheng:
You're a group of young people. You rush your decisions. That's a recipe for disaster.

Miss Du:
What's wrong with young people? You were all young once, right? Didn't you go all over when you were young, Dad?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Is that a fair comparison?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Without anyone to accompany you, will you be sure of which ways you can go, and which you can't?

Innkeeper Zheng:
For this long a journey in this season, do you even know what you should bring, and what you shouldn't?

Miss Du:
Dad!

Miss Du:
Times have changed! Stop lecturing me about your old days!

Innkeeper Zheng:
Yaoye! Listen, there's not much your dad can tell you, so...

Innkeeper Zheng:
If you're sure you're going to Yumen, then go. I couldn't stop you all anyway. Avoiding the path we laid out for you might just be for the better...

Miss Du:
......

Miss Du:
Dad, suppose, um, and I'm just picturing...

Miss Du:
Suppose we don't run our inn here, you've still got a couple cousins. Have you considered going with us to Yumen?

Innkeeper Zheng:
Yaoye, ah...

Miss Du:
Ugh, dad, I'm just wondering out loud, I know it's not gonna happen! You can just listen or something...

Innkeeper Zheng:
Yaoye.

Miss Du:
...*sigh*.

Innkeeper Zheng:
This inn was meant to be left to you. If you're not taking it, we may as well close up shop sooner rather than later.

Innkeeper Zheng:
If you want to set up your own business, I won't stop you. I trust you to have thought it through. But I still need to tell you a thing or two, and I don't want you to think I'm prattling.

Miss Du:
Dad...

Innkeeper Zheng:
You're leading all those youths. They trust you, follow you. You say times have changed... You're right, times have changed, but this sort of thing doesn't change no matter what the times are.

Innkeeper Zheng:
You step forward, and they're there all at once, so no matter how difficult it gets in future, you can't back down. No matter how tough, how exhausting, you have to bear it. Do you hear me?

Miss Du:
......

Miss Du:
I know.

Miss Du:
I... I know, Dad.

Innkeeper Zheng:
...*sigh*. Alright, take the itinerary. I've kept you off of some of the tougher roads. If you can stick to the highways, do so. Never revisit those same muddy paths we waded through.

Miss Du:
No need to worry.

Innkeeper Zheng:
It's hard, not worrying.

Innkeeper Zheng:
I have a worry, right this moment.

Miss Du:
Go on.

Innkeeper Zheng:
Yaoye, you're not young anymore. When you go to Yumen, can you possibly try and bring back a decent young man...?

Miss Du:
Stop, stop!

Miss Du:
Dad! That is SO stupid to worry about!!

Innkeeper Zheng:
How is it stupid?

Miss Du:
It just is!

Miss Du:
Ugh, jeez, I'm not talking to you anymore. I need to go to Mr. Liang's place anyway.

Innkeeper Zheng:
What do you want Mr. Liang for?

Miss Du:
I'm not the one looking for him, it's that stupid Lee guy!

Innkeeper Zheng:
If Lee can't find him, Mr. Liang's not likely to be at the estate. What use would you have for going?

Miss Du:
That makes sense. Yeah, okay! He's just using the same trick again to dupe me! I'm gonna go find him and GET MINE!

Innkeeper Zheng:
*sigh*...

Innkeeper Zheng:
You proud little girl. When will you finally settle down...?

Zuo Le:
......

Leizi:
Do not pry into others' domestics.

Zuo Le:
Your concern is unnecessary.

Zuo Le:
Lin Qingyan, what do you mean by this?

Leizi:
Eat your food.

Zuo Le:
You know I'm not referring to that.

Zuo Le:
You were waiting here from sun-up, so you could hold me from visiting those three. You have to have some reason for me.

Leizi:
I told you, I'll go with you.

Zuo Le:
Lin Qingyan!

Leizi:
You're making a scene. Look at yourself.

Leizi:
I did not make this trip in my capacity with the Central Judicial Office. Disregarding our positions, what should you be calling me?

Zuo Le:
......

Leizi:
Are you forgetting the rule?

Zuo Le:
...Auntie.

Leizi:
Good.

Zuo Le:
Why do you always bring this out to stifle me? It's not as if you're an honest relative. You're just relying on the friendship between the Lins and my dad, and being a generation older.

Zuo Le:
Just why did the Tianshi Bureaus have you make this trip?

Leizi:
For the common people, naturally.

Zuo Le:
How nice for the common people.

Zuo Le:
If that's the case, will you really just ignore... will you really just carry on like this?

Leizi:
The Grand Tutor has made his judgment. I may simply await orders.

Leizi:
But you, Zuo Le.

Zuo Le:
......

Leizi:
Within the Sui Regulator, you're still green. What is concealed behind this trip to Shangshu is not simple, and as it seems now, you have no awareness of the inside details.

Leizi:
Dispatched yet barely cognizant. Ridiculous! Who called you here?

Zuo Le:
No one sent me. I volunteered myself.

Zuo Le:
What? Don't you believe me?

Leizi:
I do.

Leizi:
I believe you volunteered yourself, but I also believe there are strange actors behind this.

Zuo Le:
This is my first time hearing that the impartial, incorruptible, honest, forthright Lin Qingyan of the Central Judicial Office has learned to speculate on the bureaucracy's murky secrets.

Zuo Le:
Don't rumors say you're sick of giving those sorts of shameless busybodies the time of day? That if anyone tries to wag on at you, you shock their brain numb?

Zuo Le:
This, right now, is far from your style.

Leizi:
You have no need to point fingers at my style of affairs.

Leizi:
I'm entrusted with your care. When things concern you, it's only natural I exercise some caution.

Zuo Le:
...Tch.

Leizi:
Did you click your tongue at me?

Zuo Le:
I did not. You misheard, Auntie.

Leizi:
......

Leizi:
Once this matter is through, you should return with me to the capital as well.

Zuo Le:
But...

Leizi:
General Zuo desires it.

Zuo Le:
......

Zuo Le:
Understood. I will accompany you back.

Miss Ning:
Assistant Minister of Rites... 'tis not a post that participates too much in government affairs.

Miss Ning:
Did you ever hear, my Lord, how this position of mine came to be?

Liang Xun:
I'd like to.

Miss Ning:
You rose upon your own excellence; this I cannot compare to.

Miss Ning:
The Ning family... 'tis major in a sense. Sordid that its ancestors were, its descendants did progress. Generations accumulated propriety, connections and assets, and so things passed down.

Miss Ning:
My father's father was an official, first rank, assiduous for quite some decades. You should know him even if I did not tell you his name.

Liang Xun:
......

Miss Ning:
I would only be ready to say so to you, my Lord, lest it seem I was flaunting.

Liang Xun:
Hardly.

Liang Xun:
Miss Ning... you are a fine one.

Miss Ning:
I knew you would not think so.

Miss Ning:
I have told you, too, that I rank seventh within my own generation.

Liang Xun:
Good.

Miss Ning:
My father's generation sought otherwise, as did the one below. My oldest cousin is on my father's side, ten or so years my senior, and has long settled himself down.

Miss Ning:
As my grandfather prepared to retire from officialdom, so I was at junior vigor's peak, and became drawn into a smuggling and embezzlement case. By a fluke I caught a string of thieves, and the documents landed on my grandfather's desk the following day.

Liang Xun:
Your ability excels, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
Pleasantry.

Liang Xun:
I would never. It is my honesty.

Miss Ning:
Then I will believe you.

Miss Ning:
My grandfather called me to his study alone; we conversed of little in particular, before he asked me this one question.

Miss Ning:
He asked: 'Ciqiu, would you be willing to give your ability and learning for the country, the people, and for the realm?'

Miss Ning:
And I replied...

Liang Xun:
...You would offer your life.

Miss Ning:
Without hesitance.

Liang Xun:
Your spirit is bold, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
Enough, now. The story ends here.

Miss Ning:
My Lord, your tea is cold.

Liang Xun:
It's still somewhat warm.

Miss Ning:
But I notice your hands are cold now, my Lord. If you would be willing to have half this cloak back from me, 'tis not out of the question we could steep a freshly brewed pot.

Liang Xun:
Health is crucial. Wear it well. Don't take it off.

Miss Ning:
I am fine. If you do not believe, shall we test... if I am warmer than you?

Liang Xun:
My hands are cold. Don't be chilled, Miss Ning.

Miss Ning:
Aiya!

Liang Xun:
After today, I don't know when we'll find the chance to meet again.

Liang Xun:
Take more care of your health, Miss Ning. Don't let the cold tempt you.

Liang Xun:
Should...

Liang Xun:
Should you ever wish to view the flowers in future, and don't deem it too far-flung, then you needn't take it upon yourself. Have someone take a letter, and send them to me to plant.

Miss Ning:
......

Liang Xun:
Miss Ning?

Miss Ning:
Right, ah, um...

Miss Ning:
Well... Given you speak so, I will be straightforward too.

Miss Ning:
My Lord, how much longer are you going to keep that ribboned jewelry case in your pocket?

Liang Xun:
...Ahem. This is...

Miss Ning:
Is...?

Miss Ning:
What, my Lord? Could you have possibly intended to give that to another?

Lee:
......

Lee:
Ugh, can't stand it.

Pole-Carrier:
We shouldn't have taken you to him.

Taihe:
Shouldn't have.

Taihe:
Won't you show yourself?

Lee:
Wouldn't work, showing myself now.

Lee:
Their whole back-and-forth's more of a work of art than any stage play.

Lee:
Who knew old Liang would... *sigh* Never we mind.

Lee:
No... That won't do. I do mind!

Lee:
Who knew after a decade and change apart, Liang would turn out like this!

Pole-Carrier:
A decade and change apart. It's not uncommon.

Lee:
It gets to me.

Lee:
At least there's still tea to drink, and a play to watch.

Lee:
Well, Liang Xun, you owe me another now.

Lee:
*sigh*...

Lee:
One last cup of wine with an old friend really is difficult to swing.
