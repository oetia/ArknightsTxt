Capone:
9:35. Five minutes late.

Capone:
We'd better find another place. For safety.

Gambino:
I don't want to spend a second more than I have to, but you know what want even less? To miss our contact.

Gambino:
He's supposed to come straight to us first thing after getting into Lungmen, but there ain't a single soul coming out of city gate. He's probably stuck somewhere inside. So we wait.

Capone:
Too many eyes here at the city gateway. You sure you wanna stick around?

Gambino:
What else are we gonna do? We gotta do what the psycho bitch wants!

Gambino:
You remember the first thing she said after she caught us?

Capone:
'Changed my mind. Let's hope you're more useful to me alive than dead.'

Gambino:
Not that thing! The next one!

Gambino:
'Don't blow this. Mess up a single time, I cut your throats.'

Gambino:
So, so instead of risking missin' our guy and losin' the letter, I'd rather be a little more conspicuous.

Capone:
You—Whatever.

Capone:
There's the crowd.

Gambino:
What does the guy look like again?

Capone:
Don't hurt yourself trying to remember. It's not going to happen.

Gambino:
What do you mean?

Capone:
*sigh*.

Capone:
The broad never said anything about what our contact looked like or what he's wearin'. He'll come to us, not the other way around.

Capone:
You remember how the meeting goes down, right?

Capone:
Gambino?

Gambino:
The contact asks us, 'Would you like some mayonnaise teppanyaki macaroni,' we'll tell him, 'Supersize, for two,' and he'll give us the letter.

Capone:
I'm impressed.

Gambino:
Just hearing that password makes me wanna puke. Couldn't forget it even if I wanted to.

Capone:
It's 9:50. Even the last group into the city is gone by now.

Capone:
Something must've gone wrong. We should move.

Gambino:
What if he shows and we ain't here?

Capone:
Like that could happen. We can't just stand around any longer!

Gambino:
Maybe customs busted him?

Gambino:
Even if not, no harm in waitin' for him a little longer. It's his own damned fault he didn't find us. The crazy bitch can't do nothing about that...

Capone:
What's the difference?!

Capone:
She's off her goddamned rocker. She ain't gonna think about who's at fault here, it's all about results! If you don't move your furry ass right now, you're signing our death certificates!

Gambino:
Alright, let's say I do it your way. Where do we look for him?

Capone:
Use your brain.

Capone:
Only a Siracusan would write the looney broad a letter. Aside from Penguin Logistics, who else in Lungmen's got anythin' to do with Siracusa?

Gambino:
You tellin' me it's the traitors we brought with us from the old country?

Gambino:
Not only did they betray us, they're nabbing our guy?

Capone:
Heh, guess you do still got a couple of brain cells to rub together.

Gambino:
......

Capone:
Can't say for sure it was them, but they do fit the profile. They're gonna know something, at least.

Capone:
Andiamo.

Gambino:
Those traitorous cazzi. One day, I swear I'm gonna—

Capone:
Hold it!

Capone:
I've been telling you since the first day we stepped into Lungmen. They got their own rules here.

Capone:
Don't forget how we lost to the Rat King, and how he let us go without a scratch.

Gambino:
Don't need the reminder, Capone!

Capone:
I sure hope so.

Capone:
So, we're droppin' in on the traitors' hideout. We ain't there to pick a fight or teach 'em a lesson. Just doin' a little information gathering. You hear me?

Gambino:
......

Capone:
Slow down. This is the place.

Capone:
How do you feel?

Gambino:
Never better.

Gambino:
What's the plan? Grab a couple and start askin' questions?

Capone:
Probably a better way.

Capone:
If they're the mooks who kidnapped our Messenger guy from Siracusa, then it's somethin' their bosses cooked up. And if it wasn't them, then these small timers ain't gonna know anything.

Gambino:
It's times like these you actually give that brain a little workout, huh?

Capone:
......

Gambino:
So, how are we runnin' this one? Like we did in the old days? You go make some noise while I sneak in?

Capone:
Not so fast. We gotta case the joint a little longer. Don't take a risk if their guard is low enough.

Capone:
We're working for the crazy broad. I need all the help I can get, even if you usually do more harm than good.

Gambino:
Hah, listen to yourself. If it wasn't for me, you woulda screwed up enough for the psycho to run you through.

Mafioso A:
Haha, twenty-one!

Mafioso A:
Hell yeah, come to papa!

Mafioso B:
Hold on, what the hell's that?

Mafioso A:
What's what? You better pay up—

Mafioso B:
We got a cheat!

Gambino & Capone:
......

Capone:
(Quietly) The lookouts are playin' cards in broad daylight?

Gambino:
(Quietly) If I were their boss, I'd shove the whole deck down their throats.

Capone:
(Quietly) Save it. Who do you even think you are now?

Gambino:
......

Capone:
(Quietly) Besides, it's pretty convenient for us they ain't payin' attention.

Mafioso A:
*Sigh*... I lost big this time.

Mafioso A:
Haven't been paid jack for a while now. Wouldn't've been playin' otherwise.

Mafioso B:
What, you think I'm loaded? You were tryin' to steal from me!

Mafioso A:
Your turf is close to the markets. At least you can pick up some odd jobs and run errands around there. Me? I gotta stroll around the Infected camp. Place's like a graveyard. No work at all, even if I tried looking for some!

Gambino:
Odd jobs?!

Mafioso A:
Who's there?!

Mafioso B:
What? What was that?

Mafioso A:
I heard someone say something just now, and pretty damned close.

Mafioso B:
What did they say?

Mafioso A:
I think it was... 'odd jobs?'

Mafioso B:
Hahahaha... You're hearin' things. Or some punk's tryin' to spook you.

Mafioso A:
Maybe.

Capone:
(Quietly) Are you outta your mind?!

Gambino:
(Quietly) No...

Gambino:
(Quietly) Back when we picked up these kids, when we made them Gambinos, Sicilians...

Gambino:
(Quietly) Did ever think they'd end up... errand boys?

Gambino:
(Quietly) Outta my mind? What was all those years of blood, sweat, and tears for? What are they in this for?

Capone:
(Quietly) To live another day, you egomaniac!

Capone:
(Quietly) This is all good news, with the shape we're in. And you're complaining?

Gambino:
(Quietly) Of course I'm complaining! How am I supposed—

Capone:
Shit! They're packing heat?!

Capone:
No, that's an Originium explosion. A couple blocks away, from the sound of it—Where are you going?!

Gambino:
You wanna stay here your whole life?

Capone:
......

Capone:
Slow down!

Capone:
G-Gambino, you're running too—

Capone suddenly finds himself speechless, just as Gambino did when he reached the area a dozen or so seconds ago.

A man wearing a black hat and raincoat stands in front of them.

A number of local Lungmenite triads lies on the ground around him. Some of them are unconscious, while others are groaning as they hold their wounds, but they are all alive.

Man in Black:
Would you like some mayonnaise teppanyaki macaroni?

Gambino:
......

Capone:
Yeah... Supersize, for two.

Man in Black:
Buon appetito.

Capone walks a few steps forward and takes a letter from the man in black.

The wax seal on the envelope seems familiar, but he doesn't immediately recognize what it represents.

Gambino:
Buongiorno, which family do you—

Gambino & Man in Black:
?!

Man in Black:
Boss—No, Mr... Gambino?

Gambino:
Tommaso?!

Gambino:
What are you doing here—No, who gave you this letter? Where's the guy you got this from?

Tommaso:
I-I don't know! The letter's from me!

Gambino:
I know what kind of man you are, Tommaso. You can't fool me.

Gambino:
I know you don't have what it takes to put all these men on the ground by yourself. They'd beat you half-dead. The letter man's gotta be the one who did this.

Gambino:
You'll tell me where he went, if you know what's good for you.

Tommaso:
I... I can't.

Gambino:
Looks like you got pretty forgetful since I been gone.

Gambino:
Then I guess I'll gotta squeeze it outta you! You'll beg for death.

Tommaso:
No!

Tommaso:
I won't tell you, no matter what! Not even if you kill me!

Gambino:
Alright, you asked for it—

Capone:
Gambino!

Gambino:
Since when did you get all sentimental? If we find the letter man, we might just get a way out of this godforsaken town, back to...

Capone:
Look at the envelope, the seal. Don't tell me you don't know what that is.

Gambino:
......

Gambino:
?!

Gambino:
It's... from her? Why would she... Why's she thinkin' about Lungmen?

Capone:
Crap, it's the L.G.D.! They're here lookin' into the blast!

Gambino:
Tommaso, come with us—

Gambino:
He's gone?!

Capone:
Don't worry about him. We're in enough trouble!

Indistinct Voice:
Drop your weapons... surrounded...

Capone:
This way.

Gambino:
That's a dead end!

Capone:
Trust me! Hurry!

L.G.D. Officer A:
I-Is this a gang war?

L.G.D. Officer B:
No, looks more like a one-sided power move... See? They're all alive.

L.G.D. Officer A:
You're right. They're hurt pretty damned bad, though.

L.G.D. Officer A:
The perp can't be far! Let's move!

L.G.D. Officer B:
Which way?

L.G.D. Officer A:
We have patrols on both ends of the street. If they had even half a brain, they'd have gone down this alley.

L.G.D. Officer B:
Hah, I know this alley. It's a dead end.

Gambino:
(Quietly) This is your idea of a way out?

Capone:
(Quietly) Didn't you hear 'em? They got men posted on both ends of the street. We're trapped!

L.G.D. Officer A:
Alright, come on out. You can't hide!

L.G.D. Officer B:
Seeing as you didn't kill any of them, we'll go easy on you.

L.G.D. Officer A:
Stop resisting. Come out already!

Gambino:
(Quietly) They're gonna find us!

Capone:
(Quietly) Shut up. I'm thinking. I'm thinking...

L.G.D. Officer A:
We know you're hiding behind that wall. Drop your weapons and come on out!

Gambino:
(Quietly) Got anything yet?

Capone:
(Quietly) I'm thinking. I'm—

L.G.D. Officer A:
I'll say it again. Drop your weapons, and we'll go easy—

Gambino:
In your dreams!

L.G.D. Officer A:
Freeze—

L.G.D. Officer B:
Stop! Stop right there!

Gambino:
Now, make a run for it!

L.G.D. Officer B:
What? He's got an accomplice. Is this a diversion? Quick! Call for backup—

L.G.D. Officer A:
He's got at least one accomplice. They have crossbows. Terrible aim!

Capone:
Terrible what?!

Capone:
If this wasn't Lungmen, I woulda blown your brains out!

Capone:
*pant*... *pant*...

Capone:
They probably won't catch us here.

Gambino:
All we ever do these days is run, hmph. And all because of a few punks?

Capone:
It's just like you to say that, you egomaniac.

Gambino:
......

Capone:
That arrogant air of yours gets more intense the harder we're screwed. It pisses me off more than it did when we were young.

Gambino:
What? Takin' a trip down memory lane?

Capone:
A little.

Gambino:
......

Gambino:
I still remember who gave me this last arrow wound here.

Gambino:
And if I weren't in the same boat as that cazzo right now, I'd give him one to match, a little closer to his heart. No point in going down memory lane otherwise.

Capone:
Yeah, you're damned right.

Capone:
And I'd love to stick another arrow in that arrogant bastard. The brain this time. I won't miss.

Gambino:
Hah, nice. If you wanna do me in so badly, why don't we get right down to it?

Capone:
You think I'm scared of you?

Gambino:
What else could it be? You couldn't take me down, not without gettin' the jump on me.

Capone:
(Deep breath)

Capone:
Sure, I couldn't take you in a fight.

Gambino:
Oh? Finally admitting it?

Capone:
Don't forget who we work for... You brought her up earlier, now it's my turn to remind you.

Gambino:
......

Capone:
Looks like you're still sane enough to calm down. Thank God.

Capone:
I'm still worried, though. After all, we didn't get the letter from the real contact. You think that crazy broad might say we messed up?

Gambino:
Hell would I know?

Gambino:
All I know is the two of us together wouldn't last ten seconds against her.

Gambino:
Ain't like we got a choice, so why worry about it?

Lappland:
I can smell you two through the door. You've been standing outside for a while. What's up?

Capone:
N-Nothing, ma'am. All's well. Everythin's just fine. We got the letter.

Lappland:
Everything's fine?

Capone:
Yeah, it all went really well. Great, even.

Lappland:
It all went well, but it took you this long to come back?

Capone:
......

Lappland:
Show me the letter.

Capone:
D-Done already? Y-You read it that fast?

Lappland:
Got a problem?

Capone:
N-No, not at all. No problems with that. Not a single one. No opinions even.

Lappland:
Feels like you still have something to say, though?

Capone:
......

Gambino:
What he's tryin' to say is... Does that letter talk about us at all?

Lappland:
Haha, hahahahaha.... HAHAHAHAHA!

Gambino & Capone:
......

Capone:
Well?

Lappland:
Yeah.

Lappland:
The letter says I can deal with you two however I like.

Lappland:
What's the matter? No reaction to that bit of information?

Capone:
Is... Is that really it?

Lappland:
Heh, never would've thought. You've got a nose for this sort of thing.

Lappland:
The letter says that, considering what absolute failures, what miserable embarrassments you two have been, I should dig a hole somewhere out in the barrenlands and leave you six feet deep.

Lappland:
......

Lappland:
You don't seem very surprised.

Gambino:
What's to be surprised about? Even I think we're embarrassing.

Lappland:
So, what'cha gonna do?

Lappland:
Take your own lives in disgrace?

Lappland:
You could try to make a run for it again. I'll give you fifteen whole seconds this time.

Capone:
Don't joke about that. We know the score.

Lappland:
Heh.

Lappland:
Alright, I have another idea.

Gambino & Capone:
......

Lappland:
You two never actually meant all that much to them in the first place.

Lappland:
You know their rules, right? Stop fooling yourselves. Signora Sicilia isn't going to care about two rabid stray dogs. Hell, she doesn't even care about me.

Lappland:
You two know what that means. It's Siracusa itself that wants you two gone.

Lappland:
I don't really care much about that, but even I think you two desperate puppies are a pathetic sight.

Lappland:
So, why don't you duel it out?

Lappland:
That'll get you back some of that so-called honor, the one who wrote the letter ends up in a better mood, and I'll get me some quiet time.

Lappland:
How about it? Whaddya think?!

Gambino:
A blood pact, then...

Lappland:
What was that?

Gambino:
If we go against the letter's instructions, betray our own Family, and even make a pact with you, you'll only be able to protect the one who lives, right?

Lappland:
Pact? Protect? Betrayal?

Lappland:
Do I have to tell you guys how many times you've stabbed each other in the back? Me?

Capone:
Alright... I accept.

Gambino:
Capone?!

Capone:
Didn't you just tell me there's no point in going down memory lane?

Capone:
Alright, I'm in. I'll count to three, and that's when we'll go. We'll see who lives.

Capone:
And by the way, I didn't strike before I finished talkin'. That's me makin' it up to you for all those times I stabbed you in the back.

Gambino:
Alright, traitor. We'll call it square.

Capone:
Tre...

Capone:
Due...

Capone:
Uno!

Capone:
Fight!

Lappland:
Hahahaha... Hahahahaha! HAHAHAHA!

Lappland:
I love that!

Lappland:
More! Give me more! Free the hate in your hearts! Show me just how far you can go when your lives are on the line!

Capone:
Gambino, now!

Gambino:
Graaaahhhh!!

Gambino:
Take this—

Capone:
To the left!

Capone:
No way... She didn't even draw her sword—

Lappland:
Amateurs. I know where your attacks are coming from without even really looking.

Lappland:
You make a good couple of brothers. The dumb one is dumb as hell, and the one that looks smart only looks it.

Lappland:
I bet you two didn't have it that hard back in Siracusa when you were little. Life must've been comfortable?

Capone:
Gambino, don't give her the room to talk—

Capone:
No way! Barehanded?!

Lappland:
Is that so surprising?

Lappland:
It's like we come from two totally different Siracusas.

Lappland:
Just like this.

Lappland:
How does it feel to have your own crossbow bolt pressed against your throat?

Capone:
Can't say I'm feelin' a lot.

Lappland:
Since you didn't like my idea, I'll have to follow the letter and dispose of you two in whatever way pleases me.

Capone:
You forgot about one thing.

Lappland:
What's that?

Capone:
This is Lungmen.

Lappland:
So?

Capone:
You can't cut a throat with rubber-tipped bolts!

Lappland:
I knew you had a knife on you. Didn't expect you to be so quick to draw it.

Lappland:
But still... too slow!

Capone:
Gugh—

Lappland:
And sure, these bolts with rubber heads can't kill.

Lappland:
But it's not so hard to find your aorta.

Capone:
*chokes*

Gambino:
Capone?!

Capone:
Ugh... Guh—

Capone:
*cough* *cough*!

Lappland:
Congrats. You saved your life.

Capone:
*cough*... So what? You're still gonna...

Gambino:
Save it, Capone.

Gambino:
We should've died here a long time ago. Let's at least go out like real Sicilians.

Lappland:
Oh?

For a brief moment, Gambino and Capone think they are seeing things.

They see Lappland holding the exquisitely decorated envelope and the neatly unfolded letter above an open flame.

A corner of the letter lights up.

Gambino:
Are you nuts?! You... You burned Signora Sicilia's letter?!

Lappland:
Oh? You didn't think I was nuts?

Lappland:
It's a letter full of pretentious, make-believe honor tripe. Feels much better to just burn it.

Capone:
This... crazy bitch...

Lappland:
What, you're going to stick up for her?

Capone:
I wouldn't dare.

Lappland:
Now that's the truth. You wouldn't dare. Neither of you. Whether it's baring your fangs against her or sticking up for her, you wouldn't dare.

Lappland:
You think she chased you out of your homeland, but you don't dare speak up.

Lappland:
Aren't you angry? Don't you think it's her fault you got exiled from Siracusa?

Lappland:
Are you really so scared of her? Even though she says right in the letter she wants you dead, you still can't stand seeing that very letter burn?

Gambino:
......

Capone:
......

Lappland:
Ugh. Lame.

Lappland:
Get up.

Capone:
Where are you... taking us?

Lappland:
Taking you? Why should I have to take you anywhere?

Capone:
Aren't you going to bury us out in the wastes?

Lappland:
What you two did was clumsy as hell, but it wasn't like, completely embarrassing.

Lappland:
Also, the letter's gone now, so why should I still listen to her?

Lappland:
Alright, get up!

Lappland:
You've got work to do. You can't just be lying around on the ground.

Gambino:
What work?

Lappland:
There's more than one lone wolf in this city.

Rat King:
What do you think of Lungmen tea?

???:
......

Rat King:
Seems it's not to your taste. I've heard Siracusans only drink tea when they're sick.

???:
I couldn't have said it better.

Rat King:
But this is Lungmen, and we Lungmenites like our tea with more leaves, Mr. Cadeddu.

Cadeddu:
I have no opinion. I'm only here as a Messenger of the signora.

Cadeddu:
But I hope you can understand that, no matter which land we walk, Siracusans are always Siracusans, and we Siracusans don't drink lukewarm tea.

Rat King:
Sure, but some of our friends from Siracusa have come to enjoy the aroma of our tea. Do you, or perhaps the signora you represent, really plan on forcing some other beverage into their mouths?

Cadeddu:
......

Cadeddu:
The signora has no plans to interfere with them. Out of our respect for you, and as an apology for their transgression in Lungmen, you may deal with them as you see fit.

Rat King:
I have to apologize to you, too. This morning, our locals mistook for an accomplice of theirs. That's why they brought you to their hideout.

Rat King:
Thank you for not killing any of them.

Cadeddu:
Please, no thanks necessary.

Rat King:
Well, then, if there is nothing else...

Cadeddu:
Sorry, but there is.

Rat King:
Please, by all means.

Cadeddu:
The signora has no intention of dealing with that undisciplined bunch in any way, but there are two men we must do something about.

Rat King:
You mean those two 'lone wolves?'

Cadeddu:
Exactly.

Cadeddu:
Showing the rest of them leniency is the most that the signora can tolerate, but she will not allow these two to cut ties with the pack.

Rat King:
I have heard a few things about them. We won't interfere with the mutual grudge they hold with Siracusa.

Cadeddu:
We appreciate your understanding.

Cadeddu:
Furthermore, you can rest assured that we will refrain from doing anything unnecessary during their stay in Lungmen. However, if they spend too much time outside fooling around, we will have to interfere.

Rat King:
As long as you do so within the bounds of Lungmen's rules.

Cadeddu:
We will try, but we can't promise anything.

Rat King:
Is that a threat?

Cadeddu:
Certainly not.

Rat King:
Then your choice of the word 'try' is quite worth chewing over.

Rat King:
I will get to the point. You don't want to break Lungmen's rules while you are in Lungmen.

Cadeddu:
We don't want to, of course. To tell the truth, if we had the choice, we definitely wouldn't want any kind of conflict between us and Lungmen or its mighty Yanese protector.

Rat King:
You think too highly of an old man like me.

Cadeddu:
But some things must be done. I hope you can understand.

Rat King:
......

Rat King:
Then, for both our sakes, let us pray things won't progress to that point.

Cadeddu:
Pray? Can I take it that's where you stand?

Rat King:
With my greatest respect for Lady Sicilia, yes. That's where I ultimately stand.

Cadeddu:
Very well, I understand.

Cadeddu:
To the best of our ability, we will try to keep things from progressing to that point.

Rat King:
Good.

Cadeddu:
Please excuse me now.

Cadeddu:
Thank you for your hospitality. If the opportunity arises, perhaps we can invite you to Siracusa for a cup of quadruplo espresso?

Rat King:
I appreciate it.

Rat King:
But, first thing's first, won't you finish that tea?

Cadeddu:
?

Rat King:
A guest must wholeheartedly accept their host's hospitality. This, too, is one of Lungmen's rules.

Cadeddu:
......

The black-clad Siracusan takes the teacup in front of him and finishes it in one go.

Cadeddu:
Will this do?

Rat King:
Of course, my dear friend. Please travel safe.

Rat King:
Is he gone?

Subordinate:
He is. Our men followed him until he left the city. It didn't look like he was going to change disguises or anything.

Rat King:
Good.

Rat King:
You heard my conversation with the man just now, right?

Subordinate:
Yes.

Rat King:
Get the word out. I want everyone to keep an eye out the Siracusan mafia.

Subordinate:
I will.

Rat King:
As for the two lone wolves... We have Emperor keeping an eye on one of them. I'm not worried about her. But the other, keep a close eye on her until she leaves Lungmen.

Subordinate:
I will.

Subordinate:
And what do we do if she doesn't leave?

Rat King:
......

Rat King:
......

Rat King:
..................

Rat King:
Today is Friday, isn't it?

Subordinate:
That's right, but... What do you mean?

Rat King:
If memory serves, everyone always calls it... something Friday... What was it again? I can't say I know how you youngsters talk these days.

Rat King:
Anyway, Ice Castle Hotel has 30% off today, doesn't it?

Subordinate:
Uhh... I'll ask.

Rat King:
If they're running the discount, book a dinner for two for tonight.

Subordinate:
Dinner for two... Understood! On it!

Rat King:
Calm down. I'm just going to eat with an old friend.
