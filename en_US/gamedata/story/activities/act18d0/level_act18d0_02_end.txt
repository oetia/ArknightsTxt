Central Ursus, Pine Valley Retreat, Dining Hall

Kal'tsit:
Sir, your coffee.

Veteran-Like Person:
—Are you new?

Kal'tsit:
I am, sir.

Veteran-Like Person:
Then ask around about how I take my coffee. Bring it to me again once you let it cool!

Veteran-Like Person:
You damned Feline—eugh, a Feline! You disgusting wretch! I didn't go to war to have a Feline take care of me!

Veteran-Like Person:
Get out of my sight!

Kal'tsit:
My utmost apologies, sir, this is my oversight.

Kal'tsit:
Please don't tell the head caretaker. I'll prepare it again for you right away...

Veteran-Like Person:
Hmph! If you don't want to lose your job, you have three minutes to do it over, properly.

Veteran-Like Person:
Also... is something wrong with your eyes? If you don't know how to smile, I'll tear that face of yours off.

Kal'tsit:
Please don't... I'm very sorry to displease you. I'll go and redo it right now.

Veteran-Like Person:
Peh. Servants these days. Is a nice figure all they have to offer?

Kal'tsit:
I am very sorry, sir. Please do not get angry.

Kal'tsit:
It would be highly detrimental to your condition.

Ursus Officer:
Out of the way!

Kal'tsit:
Yes, yes. Very sorry.

Kal'tsit:
......

Elderly Caretaker:
Miss? Hey, Miss!

Kal'tsit:
Are you referring to me?

Elderly Caretaker:
Yeah, that's right. Miss, I saw the whole thing just now. Don't you lose heart.

Elderly Caretaker:
That's a Patrol Unit head... you know, you could say, people like that have no right coming to the retreat.

Kal'tsit:
He certainly isn't a noble... Does he not worry about offending others, acting so tyrannically?

Elderly Caretaker:
They say some count's very fond of him... ah, and not just that. Coming here for his 'battlefield condition?' I heard that's hokum. Bet he hasn't stepped foot on a battlefield in his life.

Elderly Caretaker:
I heard he helped the count do some dirty work, and got sent here so he could keep his head down. With a supporter like that, and with people like us, of course he lets all hell's bells loose.

Kal'tsit:
...A count...

Kal'tsit:
I never imagined a scoundrel like that could climb high enough to befriend a count.

Elderly Caretaker:
That's how it is! Who knows when one day he'll be made some lord of somewhere! Dressed all clean and fine and sitting behind some enormous desk... agh.

Elderly Caretaker:
Anyway, don't you get angry. Piss off people like that, and you'll wish it was an Originium Slug stuck to you instead. What on Terra is a fine young girl like you even doing, working out here...

Elderly Caretaker:
Never tell anyone I told you this, and don't go asking about, or else you'll get burnt!

Kal'tsit:
Yes... I understand. Thank you.

Elderly Caretaker:
Ack. The next you see him, stay away a little. Heaven knows what he'll do to you—ah, is that the new doctor?

Lillia:
Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
Doctor.

Elderly Caretaker:
Oh, oh, so you know each other... then I'll get out of your way. Definitely not break time, after all. Take care, and don't let the head caretaker see you.

Kal'tsit:
......

Lillia:
She cares a lot about us newcomers. She's a good one.

Kal'tsit:
You're right, Dr. Louisa. We cannot let her down.

Lillia:
Will you still be busy with work in a bit? There's some things I'd like to tell you.

Kal'tsit:
Apologies, doctor... I still need to brew a new cup of coffee. If that count's pet doesn't continue to pick bones with me, I'll find you right after.

Lillia:
Alright, then... remember to be careful, Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
Dr. Louisa.

Lillia:
It's just us two right now, Kal'tsit. You should be using an alias.

Kal'tsit:
'Louisa.' Borrowing your daughter's name. A disguise of that level is purely for humiliating the Secret Police.

Kal'tsit:
In their eyes, I am already dead. And after this incident, I'll leave Ursus, and may not be able to return for a very long time.

Kal'tsit:
Nobody will know the Grand Duke's death was a murder. The next time they come to the Grand Duke's side, they will only discover that in his old age, his breathing stopped.

Lillia:
Will Ursus technology not be enough to analyze the poison you've made?

Kal'tsit:
At present, I assure you this exceeds their understanding of what a 'poison' is.

Lillia:
For how many years can your knowledge stay ahead of Ursus? Director?

Kal'tsit:
The Empire's progress has already surpassed what I imagined, but these are not details we need to discuss right now.

Kal'tsit:
Lillia, your hoped-for arbitration can only end in this way.

Kal'tsit:
None of you have the means to seek further revenge; it is unreasonable. Only the paramount Emperor of Ursus would be capable of erasing the Grand Duke's honor, significance, and all else.

Lillia:
...I know...

Kal'tsit:
Good. In that case, is this the place?

Lillia:
Yes. We have no idea what Grand Duke Vanya is chronically afflicted with.

Lillia:
But I found out from the head caretaker that every afternoon at three, Vanya will leave his own monitoring room, and come here to relax.

Lillia:
He sunbathes here until sunset. When he has the occasional guests, he'll have his dinner right here with them.

Lillia:
There's no way we can get close to the Grand Duke's room, but as for here...

Kal'tsit:
We're standing right here.

Lillia:
Yes.

Lillia:
But he won't be without bodyguards. The whole corridor will be sealed off when the time comes.

Lillia:
Apart from any guests cleared to be with the Grand Duke, only his medical adviser, as well as the servants, are allowed to enter this area.

Kal'tsit:
Even so, the Ursus nobles won't permit the workers to come to this balcony freely.

Kal'tsit:
We've already waited for long enough. The longer we spend, the riskier this gets.

Lillia:
I understand. There has to be some gap, there has to be an opening... the Grand Duke's medical advisers work in shifts, so it might be me before we know it. Today, or perhaps tomorrow.

Kal'tsit:
...

Kal'tsit:
Lillia, tell me the truth.

Kal'tsit:
After the Grand Duke dies, what will you do?

Lillia:
Why ask this now? We should be focusing on what's before us—

Kal'tsit:
I'm hoping you can answer me with reality.

Lillia:
......

Lillia:
Before we reached Pine Valley, I received one final letter from Vampilov's family.

Lillia:
Sergei is still diligently serving Boris, and the city... has changed course. Perhaps this is the start of something changing.

Lillia:
They killed so many people... yet their conscience is still so clear. They rest so easily...

Kal'tsit:
You found out about Sergei's betrayal.

Lillia:
But no excuse can bring back the dead.

Lillia:
Sergei can't offer any further scientific assistance. Perhaps in a few years, they'll formally call a halt to the project. And then? I just sit back and watch Sergei and Boris continue to collude, to trample over everything?

Kal'tsit:
Though Grand Duke Vanya will be dead, you don't plan to stop.

Lillia:
There's no way I can pardon Sergei. The first time I met him, Astrov was drunk, hugging me so excited, telling me all about how he had such upstanding, excellent colleagues.

Lillia:
He looked forward to this project like no one else, and I supported him. I supported him with all I could.

Lillia:
Even up to now.

Kal'tsit:
......

Lillia:
Director Kal'tsit, you know everything, don't you?

Lillia:
If you won't speak up, I'll return to Chernobog. I'll settle things once and for all.

Lillia:
Vampilov's family have an escape route to Sami ready for me, but maybe, I wouldn't get the chance to hitchhike with any Messengers. And you...

Kal'tsit:
I do plan to.

Lillia:
Heh... of course.

Lillia:
I'm very well aware, I'm setting myself alight. So... Kal'tsit, no matter whether you plan to confess all the facts to me or not, at the very least there's one tiny thing I want you to agree to.

Lillia:
I know I'm doing something insane right now, and I know maybe you're the one in the right. But right now, I only have one request. Look after my daughter. Look after Louisa.

Lillia:
The next generation doesn't need to inherit the hassle of hatred... Even if nobody can escape this cycle in the end, at least promise me, Kal'tsit. Look after her. If you can, please look after Lyudmila too...

Caretaker's Voice:
Dr. Louisa? Dr. Louisa, where are you?

Lillia:
Here! Please wait one moment!

Lillia:
Kal'tsit... I...

Kal'tsit:
I promise you.

Kal'tsit:
This is simply a mother's final wish. I will see Louisa grow up.

Lillia:
Thank you.

Lillia:
Astrov—the last time he held little Louisa's hand, he told me something, half-jokingly.

Lillia:
He said, he hoped little Louisa would become a medical researcher just like me, and when Louisa was old enough to go to school, he hoped you'd be her very first teacher.

Kal'tsit:
I see...

Lillia:
Those were the very last words he said to his daughter before he suddenly went to the Institute that night.

Elderly Caretaker:
Oh, doctor, here you are! Perfect, if you were any later, the head caretaker would've gone ballistic.

Elderly Caretaker:
Hm? Doctor, what's got your eyes all red? Did something happen?

Lillia:
Nothing. What's the matter?

Elderly Caretaker:
It's time to make rounds.

Lillia:
I wasn't even paying attention... right, I understand.

Lillia:
Is there some kind of commotion over there?

Elderly Caretaker:
Yes, seems an old nobleman's come from far off. Don't know for what.

Elderly Caretaker:
As long as the days go by smooth, that's what matters.

Lillia:
Hello—

Lillia:
Excuse me, we're currently making rounds... It seems you weren't on the list of scheduled visitors. Can I ask who you are?

???:
Just an Ursus citizen here on a whim, looking to meet an old friend. Do carry on, madam.

???:
I hope I don't bother any of you in your work.

Veteran-Like Person:
Witte, are you off?

???:
No, old friend, I'll see you again in a bit. You should be more mindful of your health, with winter here. Don't set off that asthma of yours.

???:
As you were, madam. I'll be waiting in the hall.

Lillia:
(He's...)

Ursus Officer:
Minister Witte!

???:
Do watch out.

Ursus Officer:
Ah, I, sorry...

Ursus Officer:
The Grand Duke didn't know you were visiting. It's our negligence on the job to blame. As a token of apology, the Grand Duke would like you to have dinner with him.

Ursus Officer:
We hope you understand, the Grand Duke is ill, and if not for that, he would've greeted you himself...

Lillia:
......!

Veteran-Like Person:
Huff.

Lillia:
Ah, I'm sorry, I'm greatly sorry...

Ursus Officer:
What's wrong with you! In the presence of the Minister—

Veteran-Like Person:
Oh, nothing, just some alcohol spilled on the bedsheets.

???:
Calm down. Madam, what happened?

Lillia:
I'm sorry, the cap on the isopropyl bottle was too tight, and I applied too much force...

???:
You could've just asked someone else to help.

Lillia:
Sorry, so sorry, I'll go and fetch a towel right now...

???:
Poor her.

???:
As for the Grand Duke's invitation, I do regret that my Messenger is still waiting for me, and I can't stay so long.

???:
Do pass a message on to Vanya. Tell him to rest up with peace of mind here. Though he should remember, also, that this is a meritorious place for those Our Majesty gives favor, and not another social hub for the nobility to mingle in.

Ursus Officer:
Ah... got it, got it... if you could just hold on... the Grand Duke will be very sad to hear.

???:
This is official business. If I have to choose between Our Majesty and the Grand Duke, I'm forced to wrong the Grand Duke Vanya.

Ursus Officer:
Ergh...! You should've spoke sooner! If that's so, the Grand Duke will surely empathize with you.

Ursus Officer:
May your road be evergreen.

???:
Send him my regards.

Kal'tsit:
Dr. Louisa, what's wrong...?

Lillia:
Kal'tsit, who is he?

Kal'tsit:
Viscount Islam Witte.

Lillia:
You recognize him...?

Kal'tsit:
Ursus's new Minister of Finance, a fresh noble with deep favor from the Emperor.

Lillia:
He...

Kal'tsit:
It's alright, Dr. Louisa.

Kal'tsit:
I have only surface knowledge of his character, and don't know specifically how he made his fortune. But what I do know is, he's a present pillar who the Emperor of Ursus has personally assisted.

Kal'tsit:
And young elites like him can only have their sights set on the whole of Ursus. To the waves of crisis crashing against the Empire, the crises of Chernobog are mere tiny ripples.

Kal'tsit:
Even a Grand Duke of Ursus—

Kal'tsit:
—Hold on... hold on.

Kal'tsit:
The Minister of Finance came to Pine Valley, yet has no armed entourage?

Lillia:
Oh... I don't think so.

Kal'tsit:
......
