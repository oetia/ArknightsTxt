22 Years Ago

3:09 P.M. \ Clear

Central Sargon, Ibut Region, Desert Outskirts

Elliot:
Are... Are we there yet? How far away is it?

Kal'tsit:
If you're tired, we can stop here.

Elliot:
......

Kal'tsit:
Drop the tough act.

Kal'tsit:
It has been 7 hours and 14 minutes since our transport was wrecked in the ambush. Considering your physique and age, you've held up pretty well.

Elliot:
No need...

Elliot:
Let's... keep going. We need to get out of here as soon as we can...

Elliot:
Where are we...?

Kal'tsit:
The nearest town to where we are heading. More accurately, it's a settlement formed of several towns that had been drifting in the desert with their hauling equipment.

Kal'tsit:
At the same time, this place covers a large swath of Sargon's no man's land, more than anywhere else. This is the way out for illegal immigrants, bounty hunters, and Messengers.

Elliot:
Why aren't we going to Minos?

Elliot:
I'm... I'm still not sure I can trust you any more than those mercenaries... What makes you different?

Kal'tsit:
The difference is that you are alive.

Elliot:
You already have our next steps figured out, don't you...? What are we doing now?

Kal'tsit:
We'll look for someone trustworthy to take us out of Ibut. Not legally, of course.

Elliot:
Where are we going after that? Leithanien? Bolívar?

Kal'tsit:
Before I give you an answer, you must understand that, whatever your choice, it doesn't change the fact you are running away from your problems.

Kal'tsit:
You have no way to survive, nowhere to go, and nowhere to run.

Kal'tsit:
Are you prepared to accept the fact that your old life has already shattered to pieces? Do you understand it? Are you sure you are not just in a daze from this sudden turn of events?

Elliot:
Stop acting so high and mighty...

Kal'tsit:
If anger gives you a clearer head.

Kal'tsit:
I will be going further north. Far away enough for you to leave everything in Columbia and Sargon behind.

Kal'tsit:
I have to say. You've done very well.

Elliot:
Are you mocking me...?

Kal'tsit:
Much of what you do is rife with immaturity, and you let your emotions get the better of you. If you were a little older, I would indeed make a mockery of you.

Kal'tsit:
Let's go. We need to find someone to introduce us to the black market here.

Elliot:
Where do we find someone like that?

Kal'tsit:
I don't know yet...

Elliot:
Hmph, so there's stuff you don't know?

Kal'tsit:
I won't deny it, but we'll find them very soon.

Kal'tsit:
If you understand what 'The Land of Reefsteep' means and stands for, you won't have any trouble finding their survivors in the crowds and markets here. They will always help their fellow countrymen. All we have to do is make them believe that's who we are.

Elliot:
Uh... What's that you're holding... Sargon coins?

Elliot:
What can you even do with a few coins...?

Kal'tsit:
You'll know soon enough.

Sargon Townsfolk?:
......

Sargon Townsfolk?:
(Sargonian) Get lost, Columbian...!

Elliot:
Huh? Enem—?!

Mon3tr:
(Hiss)

Sargon Townsfolk?:
Arghhh—Ahhhh—Monster! Where did it come from—?!

Mon3tr:
(Thrusts)

Sargon Townsfolk?:
Gah... Dammit... Why...?! I can't hurt it...!

Passerby Sargon Townsfolk:
What's going on?! Ahhh—A monster! A monster's here to kill us!

Elliot:
That's a huge crowd... Hey, what's going on? Who's this guy?

Kal'tsit:
A bounty hunter from Vouivre... Looks like they're expanding their search area.

Kal'tsit:
Quick. Follow me.

Elliot:
Uh, wait—

Elliot:
We came all the way here, but anyone walking down the street could still be a hitman. What's the point of coming—

Kal'tsit:
That's exactly why you need to pick up the pace.

Elliot:
What I'm saying is you haven't solved anything, Adviser Kal'tsit!

Kal'tsit:
......

Elliot:
These outfits make us stand out, don't they...?

Peddling Voices:
(Sargonian) This is just a can of vegetables. Why is it so expensive?

Peddling Voices:
(Sargonian) Our rugs are famous far and wide—Something wrong with our quality? Impossible!

Peddling Voices:
(Sargonian) Genuine top-grade earthenware jugs once used by the Lord Ameer—Sixty? Down from sixty thousand? Whatever, sold!

Elliot:
There's a lot of people here... Is this where the market is?

Elliot:
...? Why'd you stop—Mm?

Elliot:
Being superstitious this time...?

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Ah... How rare... It has been a long time since an outsider paid Old Isin a visit.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Do you wish to take a peek at what destiny has laid out before you, or perhaps you are searching for a particular piece of gravel in this sandstorm?

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Am I correct to assume you are responsible for the ruckus earlier?

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Old Isin can tell, dear traveler. You are in a hurry, and trouble follows in your footsteps... Old Isin simply hopes this won't lead to any more trouble for Sargon...

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
You are not from Sargon, no, but you carry a great burden...

Elliot:
What is he mumbling to himself about...? Let's not waste any more time on him, Kal'tsit. They'll catch up!

Sargon Villager:
(Sargonian) You fraud! What are you still doing here?! Scram!

Sargon Villager:
(Sargonian) You're mucking up our turf! Enough with your tricks! No one here's going to fall for that!

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
(Sargonian) Oh, right, of course. Don't be so violent now... Old Isin will leave. Old Isin is leaving.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
(Sargonian) Is your master doing well? Has she taken Old Isin's advice and pulled out of that deal yet? It will mean nothing but trouble for her.

Sargon Villager:
(Sargonian) My master? The chief would never listen to you jabbering types in the first place. If any lunatic in town could just waltz in and tell us how to do business, we might as well set up a suggestion box!

Sargon Villager:
(Sargonian) Enough chit-chat! Get out of here!

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Hmm!

Elliot:
......

Kal'tsit:
Are you okay...?

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Agh... It hurts... Please, don't worry. Old Isin's gotten used to it long ago...

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Old Isin cannot save them. Old Isin cannot get them to come around... Old Isin can do nothing but watch as they draw ever closer to their destruction day after day.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Please accept Old Isin's apologies, but as you can see, Old Isin is being thrown out of this place. If there is anywhere willing to take in poor Old Isin, that's where Old Isin will go.

Kal'tsit:
(Sargonian) Wait.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
(Sargonian) Old Isin mustn't... Old Isin mustn't...

Sargon Villager:
(Sargonian) Stay out of this. If he doesn't leave, it's gonna be on our heads. Just let him go!

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
(Sargonian) She's right. Her master calls the shots here, and she mustn't be trifled with. Let Old Isin leave, kind traveler. Let Old Isin return to his ice-cold home.

Elliot:
Why are we wasting our time here on this old conman again?

Kal'tsit:
At least you can tell he's old.

Elliot:
What do you mean...?

Kal'tsit:
But you can't imagine how old he is.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
The sun has set long ago, traveler. You are in a hurry, and there are dangers abound. Why waste your time here with Old Isin?

Kal'tsit:
(Sargonian) As time goes by, even the greatest Padishah will one day be lost to the sands. His achievements will at that point crumble, and his subjects will scatter across the lands.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
(Sargonian) From the way you are dressed, you don't seem to be Sargonian. Is this perhaps the beginning to a narrative poem? Old Isin is far too old. Old Isin has long forgotten the appeal of poetry.

Kal'tsit:
(Sargonian) But his servants remain ever dedicated to their duties. They guard the unpopulated desert until a new civilization is ready to stand atop its sands, until the time a new Padishah arrives with the will of Sargon to rebuild those lands.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
(Sargonian) Ah, similar stories happen in all countries in the world time and again.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Catastrophes, diseases, war... There are a great many ways a city can meet its end... and to find itself conquered by a new, spirited ruler, thereby repeating the cycle once again.

Elliot:
(What are they saying... Is this how Sargonian sounds?)

Kal'tsit:
(Sargonian) 150 years ago, before these golden sands were named Ibut, there stood a magnificent city here. Do you remember anything of it?

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
(Sargonian) Of course... Old Isin remembers. The city that disappeared in those great winds.

Kal'tsit:
(Sargonian) The Padishah at the time gave these lands brimming with sand a name that might seem unfitting for a place in Sargon.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
......

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
...Reefsteep...

Kal'tsit:
(Sargonian) The only thing that remains of it is its name, passed down from one generation to the next, with none of them ever laying their eyes on its lush oases.

Kal'tsit:
(Sargonian) Are you its gatekeeper, then?

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
......

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Is there anything Old Isin can do for you?

Kal'tsit:
We want to escape Sargon, leaving no tracks.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Ah... Old Isin understands. Whose attention are you trying to avoid?

Kal'tsit:
Not even Padishah can know of our whereabouts.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Who are you?

Kal'tsit:
Please call me Kal'tsit.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
Kal'tsit... Lady Kal'tsit... As Old Isin gazed upon the sunrise this morning, Old Isin slipped back into my dreams in a trance. In Old Isin's dreams, Old Isin was told there would be a visitor who would revel in these secrets of antiquity with us.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
You came early. The price is a single gold coin, my fair lady.

Kal'tsit:
You deserve it.

Elliot:
(Just that much...?)

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
No, no... Not yet. Please hold on to it, my lady.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
This is a price that you will pay—22 years later. Remember this promise well, for it is worth far more than this gold coin.

Kal'tsit:
(Sargonian) You have lived in Sargon in its current form for the past hundred years. I suppose... not a single moment has gone by where you didn't look back and reminisce your homeland.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
(Sargonian) You are correct, my lady, but today is different.

Mysterious Fortune Teller:
(Stranger Sargonian) You opened the door for us.
