Ursus, 147km northwest from the main course of nomadic city Chernobog, village

???:
A hamlet...

Ursus Villager:
Quick, quick, the doctor says to get warm water!

Ursus Villager:
Where would we find warm water so easily? Ask Marfa, ask if her family still has any water they boiled this morning.

Ursus Villager:
Emperor above, we beg you, bless our old dedushka...

???:
Excuse me... What's happening here; who's the doctor you mentioned?

Ursus Villager:
Oh, you're... who are you?

Ursus Villager:
Where did you come from... your clothes mean you're from the city, right? Sorry, sorry, we're busy aiding someone right now... If you don't mind, come with me this way, at least you'll have a place to sit.

???:
It's okay... I came here to find that doctor, as it happens. What's her name?

Ursus Villager:
You... you're not here to...

???:
She's just a shady doctor. Do you have great trust in her?

Ursus Villager:
But she... she's all we have who can save our dedushka. I beg you, I'm begging you, at least just for now—she's only a doctor here to save us.

???:
I'm not here to seize her. I just have a little business with her.

???:
Could you show me the way?

Ursus Villager:
I... I don't know if...

???:
I'm a doctor too. Perhaps I can be of help.

Ursus Villager:
Oh, even a burdenbeast would know you're a scholar, seeing your clothes...

???:
You can tell Dr. Kal'tsit something first. Tell her, her student Lillia's here to visit her, and ask her if she needs any assistance or not.

Ursus Villager:
Ah, so you know the doctor's name, and you're Lillia, is that right? Good, good, truly a wonderful name. Wait there for a moment, I'll go right now.

Ursus Villager:
Ay, hey! Don't forget to ask Marfa, bring warm water over!

Lillia:
......

Patient:
Ugh, ughah...

Kal'tsit:
Grit your teeth, and keep holding on.

Patient:
Ugheaaagh—grh—

Lillia:
...Kal'tsit...

Lillia:
......

Lillia:
What's going on here?

Kal'tsit:
Attacked by a wild beast. This is just emergency treatment.

Kal'tsit:
Knife.

Ursus Villager:
Ah, er... where—where was it... I can't find...

Lillia:
Here. Hand.

Kal'tsit:
......

Lillia:
An Infected creature?

Kal'tsit:
Correct.

Lillia:
Any risk of Infection?

Kal'tsit:
Most Infected creatures are cleaner than people imagine. By the toothmarks, a tuskbeast roaming the vicinity.

Lillia:
But if it's come into contact with active Originium...

Kal'tsit:
Infected creatures may have methods to coexist with pathogens, but humans do not.

Kal'tsit:
The situation is severe. This is not Originium infection alone. Additional necrosis symptoms are present.

Patient:
Hurts... so much...

Kal'tsit:
Calm down, now. Deep breaths.

Patient:
Hphhh—haaah—hphhh—

Lillia:
Difficulty breathing, likely thrombosis. All symptomatic of acute Oripathy.

Ursus Villager:
But—But doesn't Oripathy make crystals grow out of your skin?! Our dedushka's fine, see, isn't he?!

Lillia:
In certain circumstances, the source of infection ends up rapidly circulating through the blood, and won't present visible Originium crystals like regular cases of Oripathy do. Infection symptoms intensify within a short time, very quickly.

Lillia:
If we don't suppress it via drugs... mm.

Ursus Villager:
Emperor above, Emperor above...

Lillia:
......

Kal'tsit:
You've learned a lot.

Kal'tsit:
Syringes are... inside the gray medical kit.

Lillia:
Here... You carried a suppressant like this with you?

Kal'tsit:
There's always times of need.

Patient:
Wait... *cough* *cough* Do—Doctor... is this—expensive?

Ursus Villager:
Thinking about that at a time like this?!

Kal'tsit:
It's affordable. You have no need to worry. Our top priority right now is suppressing your acute Oripathic responses, and prevent an Originium crystal dust outburst.

Kal'tsit:
You don't want the others in the village to suffer because of you, correct?

Patient:
Ugh!

Kal'tsit:
Steady breaths. Relax.

Kal'tsit:
You'll be fine.

Patient:
Ngh, alright...

Patient:
Hfff—haaah—

Patient:
Urgh... hff... do—doctor... I don't want to... become Inf... *cough* *cough*... Infected...

Kal'tsit:
I'm very sorry.

Patient:
I... *sob*... I... *cough* *cough*... *cough* *hack* *cough*...

Lillia:
Suffocation. We don't have a respirator...

Kal'tsit:
We have nothing here, but that doesn't mean we can do nothing. Bring the inhaler over.

Ursus Villager:
Doctor! Doctor! I'm begging you, save this dedushka of ours, damn it!

Kal'tsit:
The moment Originium dust permeated his wounds, it was inevitable he'd become an Infected, and all I can do is strive to extend his life.

Patient:
Hck, *cough*, *hack* *cough* *cough*—huff, hahh—

Lillia:
Has the suppressant still not taken effect?!

Kal'tsit:
Considering the patient's age, the suppressant itself was a tremendous risk. Hold your nerve.

Patient:
...hah... hah...

Lillia:
Breathing has stabilized some...

Ursus Villager:
Is he better now? Is his sickness gone?

Lillia:
In terms of his acute symptoms, possibly. But if you mean his Oripathy, we can do nothing. No one can do anything.

Ursus Villager:
How could this... Then if the man from the Patrol Unit comes by...

Patient:
Then just—Then just give me... give me up! I only had so long left anyway... Infected? Fine, so be it... Just as long as you don't let the eggheads in here to run their mouths...

Ursus Villager:
No! We wouldn't, we wouldn't, we just have to hide you. We won't let anyone find you. We'll all hide you safely.

Ursus Villager:
Doctor, thank you so much, doctor, things might not have turned out best, but we... well, we don't have much to repay you with either...

Kal'tsit:
This is merely a doctor's duty. The path ahead of becoming an Infected... is what you truly need to consider. I'm very sorry, that circumstances couldn't permit me to do more.

Lillia:
Suppressant is effective, but wounds are still infected. It may lead to worsening of thrombosis... We may have to operate and excise...

Kal'tsit:
Your judgment is correct. Good sir. Please bear with this.

Patient:
Agh—alright... alright... eaaargh, ungh—!

Kal'tsit:
Sorry about that, Lillia.

Lillia:
Long time no see, Director Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
Long time no see. Let's walk and talk.

Kal'tsit:
Perhaps... you're not enthused about conversing with me like this after that bloodbath, but from the bottom of my heart, I'm glad you're still alive.

Lillia:
So after that, you hid here the whole time?

Lillia:
From the hill over there, you can see out to Chernobog's skyscrapers. If it were me, I wouldn't opt to shelter so near a cityway.

Kal'tsit:
I'm only stopping over for the moment, nothing more.

Lillia:
What... What have you been doing, ever since?

Kal'tsit:
I don't wish for the hate between you to continue flowing unabated. In particular, it's a hatred that will not only cause one to find their own ruin, but will strongly attract direct reprisal from those murderers.

Lillia:
You're telling me all this on purpose, aren't you?

Kal'tsit:
I won't deny that, Lillia. But...

Ursus Villager:
Dr. Kal'tsit, you're leaving?

Ursus Villager:
Ah, it's...

Kal'tsit:
My student. No alarm, she came to pick me up.

Ursus Villager:
Ah, I see, then... But, well, pick you up?

Ursus Villager:
Oh, Emperor above... You're going after all then?

Lillia:
......

Ursus Villager:
If you're going, please tell us! You cured my daughter, so at least let us send you off properly!

Kal'tsit:
I will.

Ursus Villager:
Ah, alright, alright, then we'll leave you two alone. You have to tell us before you go, please, Dr. Kal'tsit... don't forget.

Lillia:
The people here seem to like you.

Kal'tsit:
They've shown enough goodwill already. I've merely done my work as a doctor.

Lillia:
They're the ones who live true Ursus lives. We've spent so long in the Research Institute, there's plenty we've forgotten.

Kal'tsit:
Even positioning themselves near a cityway couldn't bring them opportunity, nor prosperity.

Kal'tsit:
Precisely the opposite. A tyrant official with subordinate power took hold there, exploiting the poor folk to offer the Patrol Unit yet more convenient soil.

Kal'tsit:
So they can't even find one run-of-the-mill doctor graduated from medical school. And one run-of-the-mill flu strain could kill a tender young girl.

Lillia:
Your horizons are vast. Yes, they've always been... You'd still treat a flu for someone? I thought...

Kal'tsit:
You thought I was a scientist who gesticulated at papers and data.

Lillia:
To be honest, you're more a doctor than I even imagined.

Kal'tsit:
Perhaps I always was a doctor. What changes is only the treatment subject and the locus to contend with.

Lillia:
It's why your students put so much faith in you.

Kal'tsit:
Lillia.

Kal'tsit:
How's your daughter?

Lillia:
I left her with a friend of mine. She has no connection to all this whatsoever.

Lillia:
You know... how young she is. She doesn't even speak yet. She hasn't begun to walk...

Lillia:
And I left behind my child just like that.

Kal'tsit:
You could've chosen not to do this. If you wanted Louisa to live on, identity concealed—

Lillia:
You should know what I think, Director Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
I just want to try and stop you. But if not even your daughter can stall your step, perhaps my words won't reach you either.

Lillia:
That's right. I'm quite clear about that.

Lillia:
Winter's so cold this year.

Lillia:
Vampilov's father went mad from his son's death. He kept fowlbeasts penned in a loft by the lake, and every day would fantasize for a while he was going hunting with his son.

Lillia:
Ilia's child, Lyudmila, she's still young, but already comprehends certain, irreversible things. Nobody even knows how she's doing nowadays.

Lillia:
And Romanovich, too. His family sold off their whole estate, and left that city. Even if his brothers never believed in any accident, there were people to shut them up.

Kal'tsit:
......

Lillia:
And for even more. The police announced it was an accident down to the finest thing.

Lillia:
In that 'list of accidental casualties,' not a single person had left Chernobog's research institute. An experimental accident leading to a chain reaction, and reported identities of bodies provided by the military.

Lillia:
But a kind of intuition tells me... some are alive.

Kal'tsit:
Intuition?

Lillia:
Because afterwards, all relatives of the victims, more or less, received anonymous aid—as well as a warning.

Lillia:
I don't think that spineless, incompetent Count Boris, nor Sergei, that traitor, would have any mercy in them. So, someone else who knows what happened has to have survived.

Lillia:
But it took until today, three years later, before I found you, Director Kal'tsit. It took until today. You hid so well, you even fooled the Secret Police's eyes...

Kal'tsit:
They rely too much on Ursus's latest technology for criminal investigation. It actually created an opening for me.

Lillia:
Of course... you're a hailed genius. An incomparable research leader. That's why everyone embraces you so.

Kal'tsit:
—Please tell me, Lillia. How many people signed on to your plan?

Lillia:
Six or seven. Maybe even more; we don't dare meet together in public. We might be caught, used for leverage.

Lillia:
That includes me. All lost things in that 'accident' they can never have back.

Kal'tsit:
When did you start plotting all of this?

Lillia:
......

Lillia:
From the moment I found out the Fourth Army's lackeys fired the first bolt in the Research Institute, mercilessly shredding the father of my children's throat. From that moment, I started.

Kal'tsit:
Lillia...

Lillia:
Don't take me as a brave fool. Even if my health gives me so little time to work with you all... I've still accomplished one thing or another. Such as—

Kal'tsit:
You found the whereabouts of Grand Duke Vanya. The Pine Valley Retreat, situated beyond any nomadic city.

Lillia:
Oh...

Kal'tsit:
And this former Fourth Army staff officer was also highly likely to be a Grand Duke of Ursus actualizing the Sarcophagus incident, perhaps right in the frailest, weakest position of his endlessly long campaign career.

Kal'tsit:
You want to conduct an assassination, Lillia, but this act of vengeance can still be considered 'bravely foolish.'

Lillia:
...Heh.

Lillia:
I can finally see why my husband... why that Astrov looked up to you so.

Kal'tsit:
But you must know, Lillia, assassinating an old Grand Duke will have no significance at all.

Kal'tsit:
Maybe from the start, Vanya, the man so decrepit he needs cardiac stimulant injections when he gives speeches, was not the real murderer.

Lillia:
I know, Kal'tsit, I know...

Lillia:
But do you really think when I entrusted Louisa to someone else, it was just for a rational ending, a so-called fair trial? As if you can't guess, Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
Blind revenge will only cause you to lack foresight.

Lillia:
Kal'tsit, Kal'tsit. Perhaps you couldn't understand.

Lillia:
Louisa never even learned to say 'papa.'

Kal'tsit:
You can sit.

Lillia:
How long have you spent in here?

Kal'tsit:
Not worth mentioning. Lillia. You look awful. You need to rest.

Kal'tsit:
How did you find me?

Lillia:
Just sheer chance... if not for sheer chance, perhaps I'd have never learned you were still alive.

Lillia:
Lyudmila.

Lillia:
We didn't want our children coming to too much harm, so at first, we planned to look for Lyudmila.

Lillia:
But then, we learned from Lyudmila's housekeeper that someone was sustaining contact with them, aiding them. Someone anonymous, but she seemed to know it all, inside and out.

Lillia:
The same anonym had even set up a way for her to leave Ursus.

Lillia:
It was then I was sure that some were still alive. And to my knowledge, very few could accomplish something like that.

Kal'tsit:
Have some tea.

Lillia:
Here I imagined you'd be itching to ask about my business at the Retreat.

Kal'tsit:
Lillia, I imagine the one who's really itching here is you.

Lillia:
And you knew all along exactly where Vanya was... you're really just going to sit on the sidelines? You should know all the secrets he's holding onto!

Kal'tsit:
The true secrets have already been sealed for eternity in that research institute, thanks to Ilia's perseverance. Even now, the Army haven't been able to find a single scrap of the gains they were drooling for.

Kal'tsit:
And Grand Duke Vanya is incurably ill. He'll recuperate at Pine Valley every winter. Provided you have any way to sneak into a so-called high-class salon even once, it's not hard to come by the information.

Lillia:
He even brags all over about how the retreat is so beautiful and vast.

Kal'tsit:
Correct. There is no shortage of Ursus soldiers with outstanding service there, and of course, bureaucrats and nobles too.

Kal'tsit:
Infiltrating it and assassinating a Grand Duke would be as absurd as you, in Chernobog, charging into Count Boris's house with a knife, slitting his throat open and then escaping again untouched.

Lillia:
You're right. But for those 'bureaucrats and nobles,' security in there is still weak enough to make people restless.

Kal'tsit:
I won't deny that. But how do you know that's not a signal, one that Grand Duke Vanya is no longer an important figure, or that...

Lillia:
Or that his fate has already been set by certain people? I've told you, Kal'tsit, what I want isn't a fair trial. To make it clear, what I long for is a lynching.

Kal'tsit:
......

Lillia:
Now's not the time to discuss justice or morality, Kal'tsit. Only those who can rest easy at night enjoy using 'objectivity' as a shield.

Lillia:
Whether Grand Duke Vanya is censured by the military or the Emperor, becomes a scapegoat, stands the wrong side in political conflict, suffers banishment, is stowed away by the Army...

Lillia:
—No matter what, even if he dies miserably in the end at the gallows, what business is that of mine?

Lillia:
It was him who pushed for all of Chernobog to sink into deeper ruin, and all I know is he should pay the price. He should pay the price to us! He's the murderer who killed my child's father!

Lillia:
Kal'tsit!

Kal'tsit:
I'm listening...

Lillia:
I've already figured out how to infiltrate the retreat... but I also need to admit, even if the security there is suspiciously weak, that doesn't mean any of us can pull this off smoothly.

Lillia:
I've found a breach. Someone who's been in charge of security at that noble's sanatorium for thirty-plus years, but hasn't had the guts to make much side-money off it for fear of the nobles.

Lillia:
I... prepared a huge sum, with my colleagues' help. That complete life failure, who we all saw could retire any day, caved in instantly.

Lillia:
We spent immense effort to gain his trust. I was simply the daughter of a country upstart, only wanting to intern at the retreat to get close with some noble or officer.

Lillia:
But...

Kal'tsit:
You want me to help you.

Lillia:
Yes. Forging any identity has risks no matter what, but to my mind, the retreat and the information agency wouldn't be that tied up, so—

Lillia:
If even the Secret Police are fooled into thinking you're dead—

Lillia:
—then death will be your open road.
