Central Sargon, Ibut Region

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Adviser.

Kal'tsit:
Confirm retrieval of target, and before any other teams form up and cut us off, pull out of here.

Elliot:
......

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
...Understood.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
This is the op team. Advanced-Ops Adviser has retrieved the 'Sand Soldier' survivor along with target material.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Acknowledged.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Adviser, recon team has ensured the safety of our route.

Kal'tsit:
Alright, then. Let's go.

Kal'tsit:
......

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
......

Elliot:
......

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Uh, Mr. Elliot, please kindly give that case to us.

Elliot:
......!

The boy tightly clutches the case in his hands.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Adviser?

Kal'tsit:
Leave him be.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Pardon me, but we should confirm whether our objective materials are intact. And ensure 'no matter the circumstances,' they're safe under our grasp.

Kal'tsit:
You think he'll run?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
No, of course... alright... understood.

Kal'tsit:
Yes.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary A:
Uh, why did we stop?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary B:
Seems we broke down.

Kal'tsit:
......

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
What's wrong? Caster, come take a look.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Couldn't be out of fuel, right... did nobody inspect before we left base? Who was in charge?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
J5 from the Stouthammer Squad was on vehicle inspection, but they're all on the recon team. What should we do? Get in touch with them?

Kal'tsit:
Elliot.

Elliot:
Huh?

Kal'tsit:
Keep that case safe, and lower your head.

Elliot:
...What?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
What just exploded—woah!

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Recon team?! Hey, can you hear us? Tell your Casters to stop! It's us, wait, it's us!

Kal'tsit:
Mon3tr.

Elliot:
Th—That thing in your hand—

Mon3tr:
(With vigor, it rouses itself.)

Kal'tsit:
No, don't be rash.

Kal'tsit:
Protect this child.

Mon3tr:
(Responds)

Elliot:
Hhhh—

Elliot:
What—What's happening?! Weren't they with you?! Here to help us?!

Kal'tsit:
Stay alert, Mon3tr.

Elliot:
Agh—

Mon3tr:
(Dissatisfied)

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Dammit! They split as cover to set up the whole goddamn circus...!!

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Attention, Riverblade Squad, all members of Riverblade Squad!

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
The recon team has overtly attacked us, scratching every—clause of the contract! Caster division, ready up! Snipers, confirm bearings, and prepare to attack!

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
You all copy! The Stouthammer Squad has turned traitor! Fight back, open fire!!

Elliot:
......

Kal'tsit:
In the barrens, escaping an armed motorcade on foot isn't much of a sagacious choice.

Kal'tsit:
Stay here. This is the safest option.

Elliot:
Ugh...

Elliot:
......

Elliot:
Did you plan this, too?

Kal'tsit:
No. War can bring great profit to Columbia, but nobody wants that profit in anyone else's pocket. Dividing up interests isn't just about size, and satisfying everyone is extremely difficult.

Kal'tsit:
As their advanced operations adviser, I've given sufficient counsel.

Kal'tsit:
Including all 'betrayal' possibility.

Elliot:
Right now, there's a war going on outside...

Elliot:
And you're just going to sit in here, unconcerned?

Kal'tsit:
I have to remind you, Elliot, you also sit here, receiving my protection at that.

Elliot:
......

Elliot:
No... it's this box. They don't have the guts to attack us. I'm the one who's your protection, 'Adviser.'

Mon3tr:
(Discontentedly, it gazes afar.)

Kal'tsit:
I don't intend to retort. They absolutely won't dare destroy an Arts prototype that could convert half of Sargon's rainforests into barrens.

Kal'tsit:
Despite its disguise as... an engine on an all-new power source.

Elliot:
What—What are you going on about...

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Adviser! We can't hold out for much longer! We need to pull back immediately, and change course!

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Please, bring the survivor with us! We'll ensure your safety!

Kal'tsit:
Understood.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
How many withdrew?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Less than twenty. Wretched losses.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
......

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Let me say again, Captain, scores of our brothers just died.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Thanks to them pulling a heel turn out of their assholes in the middle of an operation! The company's gonna send people to wipe every last one of 'em off the goddamn map!!

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
I... don't know about that. If the Stouthammers had this planned in advance, I'm worried the company hasn't got the reach into Sargon...

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Maybe they made a deal with some lord ameer. Or maybe, they just never...

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
......

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Ugh... the adviser and the kid?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Right over there.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Let me... let me talk with them alone.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Adviser.

Kal'tsit:
Before we entered Sargon, I gave you the heads-up.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
......

Kal'tsit:
The military needed to light a fire in Sargon, and then wait for war to bring riches their way.

Kal'tsit:
Factories, mines, the arms trade—every second of its existence, Columbia has been gnawing away at this ancient country, strengthening itself.

Kal'tsit:
So its military pulled a move, brought about the birth of the 'Sand Soldiers,' had them bring scientific researchers into Sargon... to carry out some 'tech support.'

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
—But the Bureau doesn't take things that way at all.

Kal'tsit:
To be precise, it's the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Arts Units and Originium and its background desires that don't take things that way.

Kal'tsit:
Perhaps Sargon is a backwards, rotting country to some people's eyes, but its ancient wealth and power still suffices to command servitude of all the dust in its sky, to become the desert under the Empire's gaze.

Kal'tsit:
I have to say, the Bureau's viewpoint is correct.

Kal'tsit:
One portion of Columbia's people has grown narrow-minded with its ballooning riches and power. They mistakenly think they can cause wanton strife in Sargon without paying a price.

Kal'tsit:
Any one Padishah's maneuvering is enough to influence those Columbian entrepreneurs' stock prices, yet they turn a blind eye to Sargon's vast might.

Kal'tsit:
The policymakers are free to be ignorant, and failure in judgment won't harm their core interests, but you yourselves need to know just what it is you're doing.

Kal'tsit:
At least, you should know, this and your life or death are symbiotic.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
The Padishahs are the Sargon Empire's chief governors at the core, there to control their lords ameer. Would they... have anything to do with the company?

Kal'tsit:
You know what it is the company wants, correct?

Kal'tsit:
Certain high-ranking members of the military have seized some of Blaine Formative Technologies' principal shareholders, exporting these things to Sargon under unofficial cover in order to fulfill a deal with a lord ameer.

Kal'tsit:
And what they truly desire is to employ these simple, crude methods to set off a power struggle within Ibut. Because that will turn profit.

Kal'tsit:
But the Bureau believes that if the war spreads to the heart of the empire, every 'moneymaking' design will become fly ash.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
So, the Bureau wants us to retrieve the target, so as to stop the military brass from going a step too far. That I get, but—

Kal'tsit:
But the military's not stupid. Its spies within the company—perhaps you've already guessed who—have bribed the Stouthammer Squad to ensure the plans will remain in Sargon, and then a certain lord ameer can set off war.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
They had the balls?!

Kal'tsit:
Aside from the operation advisers that aren't me, all silently acknowledge this string of activity inside the company.

Kal'tsit:
The Chief of Business has no plans to stand on any side, allowing both parties to hold each other back. It might even bring in bonus grey income, after all.

Elliot:
......

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
None of this is any kid's business.

Elliot:
I—

Kal'tsit:
Elliot Glover. Only 13 when he skipped a few grades and graduated, soon entering an academy for sciences and taking up studies in Originium technology.

Kal'tsit:
Three years after, this young genius was picked out by Professor Thorne, to become in all respects his personal assistant.

Kal'tsit:
Elliot is a member of the 'Sand Soldiers.' A research team crowned as soldiers who had no idea at all what awaited them in Sargon.

Kal'tsit:
They died tragically in the sandstorm without a single clue about anything, and none of us can deprive their last survivor of learning the complete picture.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Fine, I get it. No skin off my nose.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Now where were we? Oh, yeah, Bureau and the military pressured the company, and then in Sargon, all the lords ameer clashed...

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Heheh. We were betrayed from the very beginning. And we jumped into this war knowing scratch all...

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Where'd they get the balls to do this shit... Now they've thrown us into the desert like garbage, who can still guarantee things'll go how they want...?

Kal'tsit:
The company never cared about what ultimately ended up in whose hands. Regardless of which of you survived to complete the mission, they'd still pocket a reward.

Kal'tsit:
To be precise, even if you all died right here, it wouldn't affect a single coin that falls into their pockets.

Kal'tsit:
Because the ever-eyeing lords ameer and the Padishahs would've helped you settle and follow up on things otherwise, it's only natural they brought in the chaos.

Kal'tsit:
The moment you were first drawn into Sargon by that enormous reward, you were already cornered.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
......

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Sorry, Adviser.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
You warned us out of the kindness of your heart, and you gave our op everything you had too. I respect you a hell of a lot more than I do those cigar munchers, all making up absolute shit at their meeting tables.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
But maybe... we still have one other option. Right now, pull out your arms, Adviser. I hope this decisive battle can preserve some dignity.

Elliot:
You're going to kill her...!

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Why not? That's what our original job really was, after all.

Kal'tsit:
Don't lose your head, mercenary. I know you've received secret orders from the Chief of Business, but I also trust you understand that right now, following things to the letter will only cut off your own way out.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Yeah, you've always given me an omniscient kind of impression...

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
The company sold us out, the Chief of Business sacked us like pawns, the lords ameer, the Padishahs and the Columbian military are all itching to kill us and snatch the goods—

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
—but we're mercs, and that's just morning coffee to us. As long as I can still make bank, I have no shits to give.

Kal'tsit:
What a pity.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
I'm just the smallest fry in this whole whirlwind of crisis, but whether it's in the Bureau's interest or the military's—whatever. All that shit makes me dizzy—

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Even the company thinks you shouldn't hang around here any longer, Adviser.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
This is a good chance. A good chance to make a senior adviser in Sargon disappear. Some folks paid me a lot of money—heh, and I couldn't say if they were the same who bribed the Stouthammers.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
But none of that matters. I just wanna ask you one last thing... You... You've done so much. What was it all for, in the end?

Kal'tsit:
Columbia, Sargon, and perhaps Victoria as well. Uncountable powers all wrapped up in this. And though their lack of foresight led us here, all their innumerable machinations point towards one endgame.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
—War.

Kal'tsit:
And war will bring ruin.

Kal'tsit:
I simply try to stop this all from coming, despite how weak my influence is.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
......

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
I... I don't know whether I oughta believe you... Maybe as long as I complete the Chief's orders and kill you, the company'll let us back in...

Kal'tsit:
Who would trust sixteen mercenaries forced to hole up in a cave, a scientist's boy assistant and a mercenary company's operations adviser? Who would willingly sit down with them to discuss where millions of lives are headed?

Kal'tsit:
I'll give you one final heads-up. Even if you make the Chief of Business happy, and make an obstructive adviser vanish in the middle of Sargon, it will not mean you can return home safe.

Kal'tsit:
Every hired hand in these yellow dusts believes you've made off with the final legacy of the 'Sand Soldiers'... and they will make the choice to exterminate a flock of Columbians who offended their lord ameer's graces.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
I—

Kal'tsit:
After you kill me, you want to use Elliot as a bargaining chip, but would you have the leeway for a peaceful dialogue?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
—No, you're right. I've got no chance of making any kind of 'deal' with the people who just killed my brothers. I don't work with the big picture like that.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Alright. You've convinced me, Adviser. I'll put down my crossbow, and you get that... uh, your pet out of sight a little.

Mon3tr:
(A low roar, as if to menace.)

Kal'tsit:
How are you going to proceed?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
If we keep working together, will you ensure we return to Columbia?

Kal'tsit:
Precisely the opposite. If you truly keep working with me, you will only add to the dangers you face.

Kal'tsit:
But at the least, I can plot a route for you, and help you stow away into Minos. This is the safest path.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
'The safest path.' And you're not even gonna go with us?

Kal'tsit:
My goal lies elsewhere.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
There's no way you'd say you prepped this route just for us, right?

Kal'tsit:
Don't misunderstand. This is just for those who can get out of here alive, regardless of who they are.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Sounds a little like salvation, huh?

Kal'tsit:
There's a hint of arrogance behind that word. If you have any misgivings, just treat this as a deal.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Alright, alright. Last time I didn't trust you we ended up right in the frying pan. Maybe this time I oughta be a little smarter...

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
This is a deal, Adviser. I want to use both your lives, to buy the lives of me and the brothers I have left.

Kal'tsit:
Sixteen for two. Very cost-effective.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Damn right. Cost-effective. Hah. You saw this day coming from miles away, didn't you?

Elliot:
Where are we... heading?

Elliot:
Where are we... I... I want to...

Kal'tsit:
There's a local place for dealings, which the local arms dealers and underground Originium goods merchants all call the 'Reefsteep Black Market'.

Kal'tsit:
When we find that market, its stowaways can help us out.

Elliot:
......

Kal'tsit:
What's on your mind?

Elliot:
I'm thinking about... I...

Elliot:
I just... just left Teacher's body... in that makeshift...

Elliot:
I should've... I... the blood, and the screaming... nngh, ulp...

Elliot:
*cough*, *cough* *cough* *cough*—

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Adviser's hit the road.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
What now?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Here's the map for the route the Adviser gave us. Not just the names of all the towns, but any Messenger stations we can use too. Can you guess how much this map'd be worth alone?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
Just where in holy hell did she come from?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Hell knows! But right now, she's the single straw we've got to grab at.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
Tear up all identifying marks. Can't keep using these Columbian cars anymore. We'll head to the closest city on foot. Should be about thirty kilometers, then we'll rent a new ride and get out of here.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary:
And we escape just like that?

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
I know what you're thinking... but we still aren't ready for payback. We'll hide out for a bit. Then we can go back, deal with all those traitors companyside—

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
—Who's there?!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Heh.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
So you let the 'Sand Soldier' go... Now there's a twist.

Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain:
—Enemy raid! Snipers, rea—

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Leave three alive. Get the casters ready to grill them.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Deal with all the rest.

Elliot:
......

Kal'tsit:
Have you calmed down some?

Kal'tsit:
Counting researchers, the 'Sand Soldiers' were on the scale of a hundred people when they left Tkaronto.

Kal'tsit:
You just experienced a massacre. This may be difficult, but you need to return to form as soon as possible.

Elliot:
Just what... do you intend to do?

Kal'tsit:
Retrieve the Arts prototype plans in your embrace. Assuming no mishaps, there should also still be an Originium crystal sample in there.

Elliot:
Ngh...!

Kal'tsit:
This will only delay the outbreak of war, but it will give us enough time. Enough to afford a few of my colleagues in Columbia the chance to try and change course.

Kal'tsit:
You hardly even know what that case could unleash.

Elliot:
You can't! What kind of sick joke?! This is everything the Institute worked for!

Kal'tsit:
Whether you trust me or not, I know full well just how important, how weighty, results paid for with countless lives are to a theoretical scientist.

Kal'tsit:
But I also know, if this thing termed an 'Advanced Originium-Powered Arts Conversion Device' is given different application, the sheer harm it can bring about.

Elliot:
Ugh...

Kal'tsit:
Many were aware of this. Naturally, this included your teacher.

Elliot:
Y-You don't mean to say Teacher knew we were doing wrong?!

Elliot:
How dare you suggest—

Professor Thorne:
So this is Sargon! Ah, a time-old charm of a country... look around here, at the heart of the wild-grown desert, no dependence on nomadic cities, still so full of life!

Elliot:
It is, Teacher.

Professor Thorne:
Hm? Elliot, your mind's wandering. Come here, let me brush that gravel off your head.

Elliot:
Ah... th-thank you, Teacher.

Elliot:
Teacher, if you were this caring of the women who tried to woo you, I don't think your family would urge you so hard to get married.

Professor Thorne:
Haha. Don't poke your teacher where it hurts, or else you'll be assigned to double next month's experiments.

Elliot:
Ugh...

Professor Thorne:
......

Elliot:
Teacher?

Professor Thorne:
Ah, not much, just something that popped into my head. The mountain range at the end of the barrenlands, and the rainforest on the other side, must both be bursting with life too in their own ways, totally unlike the barrens we're in.

Professor Thorne:
In that rainforest... could there reside people just as unlike those here? What kind of life do they lead, then? How does it fare?

Elliot:
The rainforest? Why all the sudden thought, Teacher?

Professor Thorne:
......

Professor Thorne:
Elliot. We believe our undertakings are for the benefit of ever more of humanity, for those still without the blessings of Originium technology.

Professor Thorne:
But at times, the fruits of our research may not be implemented as we intended. Perhaps from the start, we choose a path wrong, excessively wrong, and when we realize it, we are powerless to redeem.

Elliot:
Huh?

Professor Thorne:
Haha. Just supposing, provided a day like that dawned—

Professor Thorne:
—We'd have to try and stop this all in its tracks.

Elliot:
——

Elliot:
Mr... Thorne, he...

Elliot:
I... No, it can't be, he was deceived... he...

Kal'tsit:
Thorne's research had been rigged from the start.

Kal'tsit:
The capital bounced around to land in his hands, disguised as an exciting investment in the new energy market, perfectly unscrupulous, giving nobody any doubts.

Kal'tsit:
I'd warned him before. But perhaps the experiments' success and advancement made him put his own misgivings aside.

Elliot:
——

Kal'tsit:
No one is perfect, Elliot, but your labors will not become a catalyst of conflict and death. I came here to ensure that, and I need your assistance.

Kal'tsit:
Right. You have five minutes to gather your thoughts, and then we'll leave.

Elliot:
Huh?

Elliot:
You want me to go with you?

Kal'tsit:
You'd only die in the barrens otherwise. I won't deny your gift for the mathematical and applied Originium fields, but you don't have even the first idea what vegetation can offer you any moisture content.

Kal'tsit:
I don't want the last young one who knows the truth to senselessly pass away in front of me.

Kal'tsit:
Of course, if you feel your calling is at its end, that you have no need to press onward, I can arrange for your refuge in the Sargon countryside.

Elliot:
......

Elliot:
Just... Just who in the world are you? Why do you speak of everything so... downplayed?

Kal'tsit:
I'm presently an Advanced Operations Adviser and Arts Instructor for the Westin Security Company, Columbia... If I have to repeat myself once more to you.

Kal'tsit:
I am Kal'tsit.

'Sand Soldier':
Kal'tsit. Kal'tsit.

'Sand Soldier':
Hm... look at this contract...

'Sand Soldier':
What a beautiful signature it is.
