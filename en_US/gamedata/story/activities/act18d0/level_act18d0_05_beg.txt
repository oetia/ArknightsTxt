Central Sargon, Ibut Region, Nameless Town

Heavyrain:
You want to come with...?

Heavyrain:
You should know that you are just another suspicious character to us.

'Sand Soldier':
Have you inspected your teammates yet?

Sesa:
Heavyrain?

Heavyrain:
Everything's normal there...

Heavyrain:
But I don't trust you.

'Sand Soldier':
Yes, very well said. Of course I am not to be trusted.

Heavyrain:
What exactly is your objective?

'Sand Soldier':
My objective... is to find out what my objective actually is.

Heavyrain:
What the actual—

'Sand Soldier':
Did you know that the last Lord Ameer of Ibut died in a fire?

Sesa:
That was a few years ago... The current Lord Ameer is his son, and that whole thing caused quite a ruckus in Ibut.

Sesa:
I had to find myself a new fairy godmother right away thanks to that fire. Took me months to get used to the work there. Huge pain in the butt.

'Sand Soldier':
Right, exactly. He was my very last prey.

'Sand Soldier':
I did all the preparations and laid out my trap, but there's no more prey to hunt. I have nothing to do except to lounge around.

Sesa:
—

Heavyrain:
—Y-You killed a Lord Ameer?

Sesa:
The Sargon army will find you—

Sesa:
—Wait, hold on, what do you even want, telling us about this?

'Sand Soldier':
Ah, I shouldn't have expected any less from one who frequents the black markets. That's right, there is no one who knows I have to do with his death aside from you and me.

'Sand Soldier':
As for the Sargon army... We live in different times now. The ruling Padishahs simply care not about what is happening here in this barren wasteland.

'Sand Soldier':
My guess is that it matters not to them whether it's the father or the son that's in charge. Actually, to tell the truth, it hardly matters to me either.

'Sand Soldier':
I sought his death and nothing else. It was a rather simple request.

Heavyrain:
What are you after anyway?

'Sand Soldier':
Revenge.

'Sand Soldier':
I'm afraid it's a rather boring answer, so I don't like to share it. If I have to venture a guess, more than half of the men in this world would like to take revenge against something, be it their enemies, a city, or even the world itself.

'Sand Soldier':
For the past twenty years, that is all I have been doing.

'Sand Soldier':
My power, my status, my riches... All of them come second, and should the need arise, I will cast them all aside.

'Sand Soldier':
Or perhaps I could give them to this 'Rhodes Island.'

'Sand Soldier':
It's quite the bargain, wouldn't you agree?

Heavyrain:
......

'Sand Soldier':
Hoh, looks like you are still not convinced, young lady. You are quite cautious. I suppose you were a soldier? From Sargon, perhaps?

Heavyrain:
—None of your business.

'Sand Soldier':
What about you, young 'Bridge?' Or should I call you by the name you go by now, 'Sesa?'

Sesa:
......

Heavyrain:
Sesa, we can't trust him.

Sesa:
You're hiding something pretty important, aren't you now?

'Sand Soldier':
Hmm?

'Sand Soldier':
Oh... Yes. Right, how forgetful of me...

'Sand Soldier':
You claim to be a medical corporation that treats the Infected... Very well, it's a fairly tall tale, but I will accept it for the moment.

'Sand Soldier':
I am an Infected.

'Sand Soldier':
My fortunes are no less impressive than the Lord Ameers' riches, and I am well-connected and hold some sway, enough for me to bring a Lord Ameer to his downfall.

'Sand Soldier':
I will trade all of it for a chance to be cured. What do you say?

Heavyrain:
—You're mad.

'Sand Soldier':
I find myself thinking the same quite often.

'Sand Soldier':
But there is not a single person who walks these lands and wishes not to live. Is it not reasonable of me to want to cast all this aside just for a chance to be cured?

Sesa:
Nah, I don't think that's what Heavyrain's trying to say.

Sesa:
You don't even seem to care that you're Infected...

Sesa:
What is it that you want at Rhodes Island?

'Sand Soldier':
......

'Sand Soldier':
Very well. There isn't much time left, so let us stop beating around the bush.

'Sand Soldier':
I'm looking for 'Kal'tsit.'

'Sand Soldier':
Perhaps she will impart on me some invaluable advice, perhaps she will show me a new way forward... Yet it's even more likely that she won't lift a finger, merely passing the decision back to me.

'Sand Soldier':
That too is fine.

'Sand Soldier':
Once I eliminate every last person involved in that incident years ago, there will be nothing more tying me to this place. I am beyond anxious to leave this forsaken land behind.

'Sand Soldier':
I need a fresh start.

'Sand Soldier':
And who could blame me for seizing the opportunity if the shadows of the past so happen to be standing right there?

Heavyrain:
What's your relationship with Dr. Kal'tsit?

'Sand Soldier':
Hmm... It's a long story.

'Sand Soldier':
I owe her my life. I'm very thankful to her. This I say from the bottom of my heart.

Heavyrain:
The decision isn't ours to make...

Sesa:
Three years ago... the Lord Ameer of Ibut perished in a fire during his travels. The fire consumed an entire town, and, soon after, his son set off a rebellion, vying for the throne against his many other contenders.

Sesa:
That's your doing, eh?

'Sand Soldier':
Precisely, just as I said.

Sesa:
Why?

'Sand Soldier':
All trivial matters of a bygone era. The family had a tragic, rocky relationship to start. I only played a very minor role.

'Sand Soldier':
Why do you want to know?

Sesa:
I'm looking for clues... Thanks to you, I gotta call it quits with my investigation in the Ibut region.

'Sand Soldier':
Ah... clues.

'Sand Soldier':
Perhaps this is an opportunity for me to earn your trust. Tell me what it is you are looking for. Perhaps I will be of assistance.

Sesa:
I'm looking for someone. The director of a Columbian military experiment.

'Sand Soldier':
You are investigating a Columbian company. May I ask why?

Sesa:
Because the person I respected the most died in the most laughable accident ever...

'Sand Soldier':
And what if it was actually an accident?

Sesa:
Even if it was just an accident... I gotta know the truth. I mean, this couldn't have been the reason those guys rose through the ranks on top of my brother's death.

Heavyrain:
Sesa...

Sesa:
I know. It's my own personal issue... but this chance doesn't come often. Don't you agree, 'Sand Soldier'?

'Sand Soldier':
Heh... Ahem, pardon me.

'Sand Soldier':
Where was I?

'Sand Soldier':
Everyone needs a revenge of some kind. Targets can be big or small, and grudges can run deep or shallow, but revenge is an eternal motif to every living person out there.

'Sand Soldier':
If you permit me to undergo treatment at Rhodes Island, I can investigate this matter for you. Of course, the deals we talked about still stand.

'Sand Soldier':
Even if you have ten times the cargo sitting outside, I have a way to take care of it all. There will be no trace left of it, and you will find the price very attractive. It's a bargain for a pharmaceutical company.

Heavyrain:
Sesa... Sorry, but we can't let your personal problems be somebody else's bargaining chip.

Sesa:
Of course I know that... but I...

'Sand Soldier':
Right... I almost forgot. It seems I've been rather forgetful of late.

'Sand Soldier':
I never thought much of Old Isin's prophecy to begin with. However, thinking back, perhaps the prophecy was itself a means of negotiation and communication.

'Sand Soldier':
Hmph, prophecy... Mere mortals will never find themselves on equal footing with time itself. Originium Arts may have many convenient uses, but that is one thing you can never achieve with Arts.

Sesa:
A prophecy...?

'Sand Soldier':
Alas, Old Isin passed away long ago. I only hope that she remembers this promise.

'Sand Soldier':
Did she perhaps... give you a gold coin?

'Sand Soldier':
An old Sargon gold coin.

Heavyrain:
......!

Rhodes Island Operator:
Heavyrain, Sesa, we got a situation here.

'Sand Soldier':
......

Sesa:
Calm down. What's up?

Rhodes Island Operator:
There are some sketchy-looking teams approaching the town.

'Sand Soldier':
Let me remind you that they are not friendly.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Ugh, they're closing in quick. We can still get out of here without a fight if we make a run for it now. Take our time and we won't be so lucky.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Fifteen minutes. That's all we have. Captain, Lieutenant, hurry.

Heavyrain:
—Your buddies?

'Sand Soldier':
Of course not. I am a lone wolf with no one to turn to. Unlike machines, humans cannot be trusted.

'Sand Soldier':
That being said, they are most likely here for me.

Sesa:
—Dammit! This is part of your plan, isn't it?

'Sand Soldier':
You can help me escape, or we can fend off these unyielding assassins together.

'Sand Soldier':
What do you say?

Heavyrain:
......

Rhodes Island Operator:
W-What should we do?

'Sand Soldier':
The ball is in your court.

Sesa:
Tch, son of a—

Sesa:
—Last question, then! Why did you burn down that town? If you were after the Lord Ameer, you had no reason to drag all those people into that mess.

Sesa:
You even gave the townspeople the time to evacuate. Did you just want to ruin the town? Redhorn was miles away from your turf. What were you after exactly?

'Sand Soldier':
Is my objective really so important?

Sesa:
—I'm making sure you're not a warmonger, or downright nuts.

'Sand Soldier':
Hmm, you have a point, but I am afraid you wouldn't understand. All I burned down was my past.

Sesa:
Is that your revenge?

'Sand Soldier':
No...

'Sand Soldier':
It was a long overdue cremation, nothing more.
