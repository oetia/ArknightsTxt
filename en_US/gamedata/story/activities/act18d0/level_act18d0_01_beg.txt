Central Sargon, Ibut Region, Nameless Town

Heavyrain:
......

Heavyrain:
No-one here. (We still haven't seen a trace of them. Did they get caught up in something...?)

Sesa:
Strange. This is exactly where we agreed to meet up, right?

Heavyrain:
Our coordinates check out.

Sesa:
We can't rule out a sandstorm. Let's stay calm.

Heavyrain:
Sesa... this isn't good.

Sesa:
Hey, now. They're not here yet, but what good is it being so grim? Are we just going to have a staring contest?

Heavyrain:
Now's not the time for video games, though. Why did you bring that along?

Sesa:
Not important—

Heavyrain:
Something must be wrong. We should've at least gotten contact at a set time.

Sesa:
......

Heavyrain:
Shouldn't we do something or other?

Sesa:
Don't worry so much. What can we even do? The best plan is to just sit tight here, and wait for an answer.

Heavyrain:
But... it's been too long.

Heavyrain:
Hold on, there's—

???:
(Sargonian) Good morning.

Sesa:
Heavyrain! Cool it!

Heavyrain:
Hmph—

Heavyrain:
S—Sorry, I struck on reflex...

???:
(Sargonian) Oh, your looks deceive. You're quite the quick-tempered girl. This will only damage your first impressions, though...

???:
(Sargonian) This is the Reefsteep Black Market, and we're all in business here. I trust we have words for each other, so no need for an armed conversation, yes?

Sesa:
(Sargonian) What day is today? Why would the 'Sand Soldier' be here?

'Sand Soldier':
(Sargonian) Oh, you recognize me?

Sesa:
(Sargonian) The head intel peddler of the Reefsteep market, the puppeteer of the vast majority of all armed conflicts in Ibut, styled by the locals as 'Zuzu.'

Sesa:
(Sargonian) In ancient tongue, it entailed a charm, or perhaps a talisman—

Sesa:
(Sargonian) —but I know what lies behind your new name, 'Sand Soldier.' What's a major player like you up to here?

'Sand Soldier':
(Sargonian) Let's not get ahead of ourselves, I just wanted to have a chat with you two. With... er, Rhodes Island.

'Sand Soldier':
(Sargonian) Or perhaps... I've disrupted your original itinerary?

Heavyrain:
......!

Heavyrain:
(Sargonian) ...Where are our Operators?

'Sand Soldier':
Oh... so you're from Sargon too, then. Good. Then let's get right to the point.

'Sand Soldier':
Your Operators are safe and sound. Your batch of experimental medical material... also untouched.

Heavyrain:
Where are they?

'Sand Soldier':
Who knows?

Heavyrain:
You—

Sesa:
Heavyrain, rein it in!

'Sand Soldier':
Quite right. Rein it in. You haven't even the capital to start a conflict with me here.

'Sand Soldier':
Compared to how valuable your pharmaceutical materials are, a few porters can't be worth much in my concern...

Heavyrain:
You have your eyes on those materials.

'Sand Soldier':
And if I nodded yes?

Heavyrain:
......

Sesa:
Let our Operators go. We'll hand over the goods. How about that?

'Sand Soldier':
Oh? As simple as that?

'Sand Soldier':
But all I took was a few employees... now I'm a little skeptical.

'Sand Soldier':
Your goods might've had a small footprint, but they're not cheap. It doesn't seem 'Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals' is so profligate a company. Would you really be so willing to give them up?

Sesa:
I'll stop you right there. Forget market value. Human life is the most precious thing to us.

'Sand Soldier':
A perspective bursting with humanity. But who'll step up to weigh them, then—decide their worth?

'Sand Soldier':
Will a certain 'Kal'tsit?'

Heavyrain:
You nabbed our contract... You know Dr. Kal'tsit?

'Sand Soldier':
No, it's a very common name. Over these years, I've sought so many people in error... so many.

Sesa:
Back to our original topic.

'Sand Soldier':
Oh, my apologies. Your people are actually waiting right outside, and I have no interest in your goods—

Sesa:
—Heavyrain.

Heavyrain:
I'll go check now—you stay alert.

'Sand Soldier':
As you wish.

Sesa:
Huh! The fixer from the black market... wouldn't come here just to scare our new recruits, would he?

Sesa:
Rhodes Island and the Sargon black market are far from bosom friends. We only had to take this plunge after some of our drugs got jammed up in Columbia.

Sesa:
Oripathy waits for no-one, correct? That's all this is. There should be no conflict between us.

'Sand Soldier':
I've heard of you before, the armaments tuner 'Bridge,' having worked for three different arms dealers in the past. A fine reputation. Oh, I believe you're called 'Sesa' now?

Sesa:
Really, you make too much of me.

Sesa:
Well, then, what gives you an interest in Rhodes Island?

'Sand Soldier':
During a routine probing of accounts, a completely watertight transaction came to light. You must know, not one sheaf of gold in the Reefsteep passes out of my notice.

Sesa:
And?

'Sand Soldier':
No, no cause for worry. You haven't exposed any leverage, and as I've already said, your transaction doesn't interest me. It's just the... signature, on this contract, that I mind.

'Sand Soldier':
Come. I have time to spare today. Tell me, what kind of place is Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals?

Central Sargon, Ibut Region, the Town of Redhorn

Wounded Mercenary:
They're firing! Ambush! Ambush!

Wounded Mercenary:
Withdraw our cov—aghh—

Wounded Mercenary:
Are they mad?! With this many civilians around?!

Indignant Mercenary:
Quick! Hide here!

Wounded Mercenary:
Shit, close. Thanks.

Fleeing Civilian:
—Fire, fire! My house—ukh— (The sound of a throat being pierced.)

Fleeing Civilian:
Hurry! Hurry!!

Fleeing Civilian:
Eyaaargh—

Indignant Mercenary:
Too many civilians getting caught up...! Are they trying to pull the Lord Ameer of Ibut's whole army in!?

Wounded Mercenary:
The Lord Ameer's army? How do you know they weren't the army in disguise?

Indignant Mercenary:
You mean—

Wounded Mercenary:
Look at this.

Indignant Mercenary:
The red mark...? You picked this off one of the corpses—?

Wounded Mercenary:
I did. We've been fooled by our own. The situation here is a complete mess now. You might not even get it if I gave you the whole lecture—

Wounded Mercenary:
It's way more than just us who wanted to ransack that squad. Dammit. Grab it and turn it into cash, my ass. This is a full-blown war now—

Wounded Mercenary:
The sentry sent me all the coordinates before going black. There's four different identifiers all crawling this one area!

Wounded Mercenary:
Do you understand what this means? Either we break through the line and earn big, or we still have the chance to surrender right now!

Indignant Mercenary:
—Goddamnit! This is insane!

???:
*pant*... *pant*... *cough*, *cough* *cough*...

???:
...should be... alone here...

???:
*cough*...

???:
...wh—who?

Indignant Mercenary:
A child? Why are you carrying a body... eugh, get out of here already!

Indignant Mercenary:
Hold on... your clothes! You're a Columbian!? You're from the 'Sand Soldiers'!

Indignant Mercenary:
B8 here, we have a survivor, a Liberi child, carrying a grown man's body—

???:
——！

Indignant Mercenary:
Hey, hold it right there!

Violent Mercenary:
Alright, kids, you all heard that. The 'Sand Soldiers' still have one left alive! We need to bring him over!

Violent Mercenary:
There's still a chance our target fell into someone else's hands. Just in case, kill every last one you come across. Doesn't matter if they're the Lord Ameer's. Even if Padishah Murad himself is here, he has to die too.

Violent Mercenary:
Remember, a silver box. I want to be sitting on that singing before the sun goes down.

Sarkaz Mercenary A:
We've intercepted their comms band. It seems the 'Sand Soldiers' still have a survivor.

Sarkaz Mercenary A:
A child, carrying a body, probably a comrade. Think he's got what Padishah's after?

Sarkaz Mercenary B:
Not one team's retreated from that town yet. Chances are they're all still looking for their target.

Sarkaz Mercenary A:
Of course. Everyone swarming that tiny of a town at once is just going to add to the chaos, waste time and nothing else.

Sarkaz Mercenary A:
Hold on, our Caster's gotten news. Something's up...

Sarkaz Mercenary B:
What?

Sarkaz Mercenary A:
There's a freight truck... registration Tkaronto, Columbia... parked near the Central Smoke bazaar.

Sarkaz Mercenary A:
A woman and a monster? Monster? What monster—oh.

Sarkaz Mercenary A:
Line cut off. He gets careless too?

Sarkaz Mercenary B:
No, his ambush point is at least a kilometer out from the bazaar. It shouldn't have been that fast. Not unless whatever team this is knew the topography here like the backs of their hands... or maybe, they're just experienced enough to blow anyone off the sand.

Sarkaz Mercenary A:
Could it be someone from Vouivre? Or some other cutthroat here on Columbia's dime?

Sarkaz Mercenary B:
Let's watch this unfold first.

???:
*pant*... *pant*...

???:
*cough* *cough*... Why did... Teacher... *cough* *cough*!

???:
——！？

Searching Mercenary:
Our target's around here! He can't get that far carrying a body—

Searching Mercenary:
Tch! We've got trouble! No hesitating! Kill!

???:
...am... am I safe...?

???:
...Teacher, Teacher... come on, wake up...

???:
The... I can't stop the blood... you still haven't taught me so much... what do you want me to do...

Searching Mercenary:
...Target found.

???:
——

Searching Mercenary:
Don't move! One more inch and I'll cut your head off!

Searching Mercenary:
Scared stupid, aren't you, talking to a dead guy? Uh-huh?

Searching Mercenary:
Put that idiot on your back down and tell me, where is it!?

???:
...I...

???:
I don't know...

???:
Mmph—

Searching Mercenary:
Don't try and fool me, you worthless... huh?

Searching Mercenary:
Is this... the 'Sand Soldier' leader's body? What are you... wait, do you have it on you?

???:
—Don't touch him!

Searching Mercenary:
Gah! Who do you think you are—piss off!!

???:
Ugh...

Searching Mercenary:
The silver combination box! So here it is... heheh, hahahah!

???:
Let go of it! Get—Get out of my way!

Searching Mercenary:
Heh, now we've got the target, we don't need to leave any survivors.

Searching Mercenary:
Don't blame me, kid. This is my job—

???:
——

Searching Mercenary:
Wha—What the hell is—?!

Mon3tr:
Grrr...

Searching Mercenary:
What is that—hey, is anyone there?! I've run into an unidenti—

Mon3tr:
(Shrieks)

Searching Mercenary:
—Ugh!

Searching Mercenary:
Machine... no, creature?! What the hell kind of thing are you?!

Searching Mercenary:
Don't get any—why aren't my bolts doing anything—don't get any closer! Any closer and I'll kill you!

Mon3tr:
(Snickers)

Before his eyes, the monster skewers the ruffian.

It lightly unfolds its body, like a stretch in the early morning.

Mysterious Woman:
...Mon3tr.

Mon3tr:
(Responds)

???:
Ah... ah...

The boy is frozen in place, having long lost the voice to cry out.

He holds only an ice-cold carcass, the blood of the dead clotting on his chest, reminiscent of a flower.

Mysterious Woman:
......

Mysterious Woman:
Elliot, you're safe.

Elliot:
...!

Elliot:
Who... who are you... How do you know me?

Mysterious Woman:
I know every last esteemed scientist of the Blaine Formative Technologies Research Institute.

Mysterious Woman:
But none of you know what kind of plot this whole affair has been drawn into. I'm here to stop you, and here to protect you.

Elliot:
Protect...?

Elliot:
You're already late... too late...

Mysterious Woman:
You didn't let your fine teacher's legacy fall into those conspirators' hands. You've done well enough.

Elliot:
......

Elliot:
What do you mean, protect...

Elliot:
—You want to protect these! The blueprint, the sample, not me! And not Teacher!

Elliot:
You're just like them! Teacher's dead! All the people who were helping us are dead too! You're all just fighting over this case—you—you—*cough* *cough*, *cough*—

Mysterious Woman:
......

Comms Voice:
Adviser, we've confirmed three mercenary teams hired by lords ameer across the map, as well as one Sarkaz unit on a cliff outside the town, affiliation unknown for now.

Comms Voice:
According to our plans, we still have seven minutes.

Mysterious Woman:
I've found one survivor, sample in hand.

Comms Voice:
The evac route is secure.

Mysterious Woman:
Converge in three minutes.

Elliot:
......

Mysterious Woman:
Tell me, Elliot. The Vouivre soldier you're carrying on your back: what did he die for?

Elliot:
...Shut up...

Mysterious Woman:
Right now, you stand here, you live, and you carry what every mercenary here wants.

Mysterious Woman:
The squad operated under the name 'Sand Soldiers'... but in actuality, all that came to Sargon was a research team, and a typical security force from Tkaronto.

Mysterious Woman:
Whether or not he persisted in his duty until the end, whether or not he paid mind to your safety until the end, didn't he entrust a deep responsibility to you?

Mysterious Woman:
Whether or not because of your own immature temperament, are you going to make a total waste of all your soldiers' full efforts?

Mysterious Woman:
I only need an answer.

Mysterious Woman:
As long as I can ensure that this prototype blueprint doesn't fall into any lord ameer's hands, I will not go out of my way to mind anything else. I hope for you to understand this.

Elliot:
......

Mysterious Woman:
High alert. You still aren't willing to speak much.

Mysterious Woman:
But I remember... the man on your back is Professor Thorne. Blaine Formative Technologies Research Institute, Head Researcher.

Mysterious Woman:
He was not a true soldier. Yet a true soldier is what he is.

Elliot:
You...

Mysterious Woman:
Just put him down. Or you could be buried together with him in the yellow dust.

Mysterious Woman:
I trust he believed his death had a purpose, and you should not squander his sacrifice.

Elliot:
No...

Mysterious Woman:
He's already dead.

Elliot:
No! This isn't your business!

Mysterious Woman:
At least give him a decent burial.

Mysterious Woman:
...Mon3tr.

Mon3tr:
(Hissing)

Elliot:
What's... What's that ball of light?

Mysterious Woman:
Lower your head.

Elliot:
Ngh—!

Elliot:
...You... You want me to bury Teacher in here?

Mysterious Woman:
Professor Thorne is an old friend of mine. The situation is abnormal. We have no chance to more solemnly address his sacrifice.

Mysterious Woman:
Every person's life is an endless war.

Mysterious Woman:
On certain motives, his ancestors left Sargon. Wandering again and again, he found a life he could call his own, yet in the end he returned to Sargon's barrens.

Mysterious Woman:
His cause, his just heart, his thirst for knowledge all arrived at their terminus.

Mysterious Woman:
The Professor Thorne I knew was in no way unversed in life's affairs. Candidly, he confronted his own death, and until the very end resisted.

Mysterious Woman:
Elliot, just put him down.

Elliot:
I...

Mysterious Woman:
This is respect for the deceased. Surely you understand, he wouldn't have wished to become a burden on your path?

Elliot:
Okay... okay...

Mysterious Woman:
(Ancient Vouivran language) May his soul, with the long river, return.

Elliot:
Vouivran...? Are—Are you from Vouivre?

Mysterious Woman:
(Ancient Vouivran language) May he, as the gravel, pass into eternal tranquility.

Mysterious Woman:
(Ancient Vouivran language) May he ever hear his homeland's whispers. May he, at the other shore, meet the great waves.

Mysterious Woman:
(Ancient Vouivran language) Our friend rests eternal here. He shall return to the boundless cycle of rebirth.

As the woman bowed her head and prayed, it was as if the fire of war, too, paused for this moment.

Elliot:
......

Mysterious Woman:
...Time is running short. We've paid what respect we can. Now, you must make a choice.

Mon3tr:
(A low, alert sounding.)

Mysterious Woman:
Correct, they are many, but their formation is in loose disarray. As an armed force, they're not in one heart and mind.

Mysterious Woman:
Before they find us, they'll make their own grave.

Elliot:
...I remember, now... I remember I saw your face before, somewhere... long ago... Teacher introduced you to me...

Elliot:
I thought you were only a theoretical researcher...

Elliot:
I remember... Your name is...

Elliot:
Kal'tsit...?

Kal'tsit:
Mm.

Kal'tsit:
You have quite a good memory, Elliot.
