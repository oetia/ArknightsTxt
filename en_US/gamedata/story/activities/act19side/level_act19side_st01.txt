Hello. You've reached the office of Rhine Lab Control, Kristen Wright.

Ms. Wright is currently unable to take your call. Please leave your message after the tone. Thank you.

Answering Machine:
This is bad, Kristen. I think I screwed up...

Answering Machine:
I'll admit the Colonel's smart. He caught onto my 'little tricks' last time I made a delivery.

Answering Machine:
He's been all eyes on me along with Ferdinand's people. It took a whole bunch of clones just to get away here.

Answering Machine:
Ferdinand's gonna make his move at Rhine soon enough, I just know it... and the other Directors have to fall in line. The only other option is to play dumb.

Answering Machine:
Ugh, jeez. I might have nowhere to run anymore, seriously.

Answering Machine:
I'm a little scared. Just a tiny, tiny bit, but... you get where I'm coming from, right?

Answering Machine:
Not to worry, though. I'm still going to uphold our agreement, 100%.

Answering Machine:
—Kristen... I can't help but wonder...

Answering Machine:
If she was still here, maybe we wouldn't...

???:
Ms. Muelsyse, I suggest you stop struggling.

???:
Your marathon from Rhine HQ to the commercial district's wasted our entire evening.

Muelsyse:
...*Sigh*.

Muelsyse:
Lemme guessie, dead end for me?

Muelsyse:
You'll always catch me as long as I'm somewhere in Trimounts.

???:
No. Forget Trimounts. It'd be the same in any city.

???:
This is Columbia. The charges stick to lawbreakers, rain or shine.

Muelsyse:
This is about me breaking confidentiality with the military, right?

Muelsyse:
In which case, you should give me some time to call my lawyer—and not sic a kajillion armed mercs on me in the middle of the street.

???:
I'll say again. We're in Columbia.

???:
We don't operate by the books unless 'by the books' is what we need. In other scenarios, we like efficiency.

Muelsyse:
......

Muelsyse:
Alright. Do I still get a little chat with Ferdinand? Maybe me and him can still straighten out this whole mix-up before it's too late.

???:
Nuh-uh. That's not in my orders here.

Muelsyse:
D... Didn't Ferdinand hire you?

???:
Ferdinand Clooney might be your coworker, but he's just a partner of convenience to me.

???:
I've got no personal stake in the Rhine infighting. Ecological? Energy? I don't give a damn and my employer doesn't care who exactly we're cooperating with.

???:
What we want is results. Rhine Lab provides the goods, my employer puts thought into their use.

???:
And your tiny little 'oops moment' lost you the last ounces of our trust.

Muelsyse:
If I said... I didn't mean to, would you believe me?

Muelsyse:
I'm a researcher, ya know? I've got this habit of hanging onto test data here and there.

???:
Habit? You had all this time to think of an excuse, and that's it?

???:
I'm so, so sorry to tell you, your fancy brand of charisma doesn't work on me.

???:
I'm given to understand Ferdinand warned you not to let a whisper of any of the testing leak before the government passed every bill tied to it.

???:
Your Elven blood's stretched the expiration date on your good looks. That likewise ensures you don't form any forgetful habits, right?

Muelsyse:
You—!

Muelsyse:
You know I'm...

???:
An Elf?

???:
I read the files. I know who I'm working with. Part of my job, y'see.

Muelsyse:
......

???:
So, come, let's cooperate some. Whatever illusion you were going to concoct next, it'd be as useless as the last.

Muelsyse:
Sheesh, I guess I really am cornered.

???:
——

???:
I guess that's why you were stalling so long... You think you can dupe me?

???:
I'm not the brute forcing type, I don't go off half-cocked, and I'm not one of your colleagues married to the lab.

???:
Got you.

Muelsyse:
*cough* *cough*...

Muelsyse:
At this temperature... water molecules... don't hear my call...

Muelsyse:
Is this your Arts... or some kind of special technology?

Muelsyse:
I...

???:
Are you really free enough to discuss issues of science with me, 'Director' Muelsyse?

???:
Sorry, but I'm tired of playing hide-and-seek, and I don't want any sudden 'acts' of iced water getting my plumage or hair wet.

Muelsyse:
Hahah... you're... no ordinary merc...

???:
Flattered.

???:
Now, you still have one last chance—answer my question.

???:
Kristen Wright, Rhine Lab Control, has spent the past several years buying up a massive amount of high-purity hard material from companies high and low. What kind of experiment is she running?

Muelsyse:
Hfff... hkaah... why are you helping Ferdinand if you and your employer—care so much about Control's tests?

???:
That's not the right answer. That's not AN answer. That's another question, in fact.

Muelsyse:
Nngh...

Muelsyse:
I don't have... any of... the answers you're looking for.

???:
Your file says you love using your blood-given abilities to toy with people. I'm a little surprised you turned out to be so loyal to the Control.

Muelsyse:
Loyal...?

Muelsyse:
I'm just... looking out for... myself...

???:
Aww... you're telling me you don't want this chance at all.

???:
In which case, Ms. Muelsyse—

???:
Our partnership is hereby terminated.

Muelsyse:
Terminated...?

???:
Terminate her.

Muelsyse:
......

Muelsyse:
Saria...

Muelsyse:
You've gotta make it in time... for Kristen...

Main District of Trimounts

Saria:
......

Trimountarian:
Still waiting for your appointment, ma'am?

Saria:
She should've been here ten minutes ago.

Saria:
I've never counted on her to be punctual, but if our last comms were anything to go by, she was the one desperate for this meeting.

Trimountarian:
Maybe she backed out again...

Trimountarian:
We all know the Director of Rhine Lab Ecological prefers to hide the truth behind all those smiles of hers.

Saria:
I don't trust Muelsyse.

Saria:
I wouldn't easily trust anyone choosing to remain at Rhine Lab at this point.

Saria:
But partnerships are built on more than just trust. Did you trust me the moment I first met you?

Trimountarian:
*cough*... The truth, ma'am?

Trimountarian:
When I saw you standing outside my door, I almost went straight to the kitchen to grab a knife or something, and call the cops along the way.

Saria:
Good head on your shoulders.

Saria:
Still, Rhine Lab wouldn't use force to threaten a retired employee who signed an NDA.

Saria:
At least, not while I was still in Defense.

Saria:
A new message?

Saria:
......

Trimountarian:
Something wrong, ma'am? You look serious... serious enough to give me shivers.

Saria:
Change of plans.

Saria:
Muelsyse isn't coming.

Trimountarian:
S... Something happened to her? Right when she was about to meet you?

Saria:
Erikson, I need a favor.

Trimountarian:
W-What is it?

Saria:
Send the info I received to the local branch of this pharmaceutical company.

Saria:
Ask their operators to immediately inform Dr. Kal'tsit and Dr. {@nickname}—I know they've been in Columbian territory recently.

Saria:
I need their help.

Test Site 359, Trimounts Outskirts

Rhine Lab Tech:
Morning, Doctor. You're up as early as ever.

Rhine Lab Tech:
D... Data? You mean physiologically, right?

Rhine Lab Tech:
Haha, you always pack that special sense of humor.

Rhine Lab Tech:
*sigh*... I pulled an all-nighter just to get these figures. Director Franks is gonna rag on me for this.

Rhine Lab Tech:
Uh, is that supposed to reassure me?

Rhine Lab Tech:
Thanks... but even if she lets it fly, there's still Director Clooney, and I don't wanna go back to him...

???:
You're overdue for a good night's sleep, Helen.

Rhine Lab Tech:
Elena... you know we have evaluations next week. How am I supposed to sleep with an eval weighing on me?

Rhine Lab Tech:
I can't lose this job. I'm still paying off my student loans...

Rhine Lab Tech:
Sorry, I know I keep bringing that up.

Elena:
Hm... how's this sound? I'll raise your situation with the Director once the experiment's over.

Rhine Lab Tech:
S-Seriously? Elena... you're the only one in all of Energy who isn't terrified of Director Clooney. What's your secret?

Elena:
You've just gotta be like me...

Rhine Lab Tech:
Spending every single day in the lab, making the Director happy with every last thing you do? Th—That's not realistic for me...

Rhine Lab Tech:
Oh, right! I needed to check in with Director Franks! Gotta go!

Elena:
See you.

Elena:
I made coffee. You want some?

Elena:
I hear you, but I'm still not about to give up my life for the word 'may.'

Elena:
If the docs had the final word, I'd be best off staying at Rhodes Island with my sister.

Elena:
Same for you, right, Joyce? Medical wants you aboard long-term.

Elena:
Sure... just a few days, and then you'll meet back up with Dr. Silence in the city, right?

Elena:
Me and Dorothy'll miss you.

???:
Joyce needs rest. Work gets too intense here at the site.

???:
And you, Elena. If it wasn't for Ferdinand talking you up as his most outstanding researcher, I'd be on the case to kick you back to the city too.

Elena:
So you're here at last, Dorothy.

Elena:
Helen just went looking for you. You didn't run into her?

Dorothy:
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention...

Elena:
Seriously, you're gonna work until you faint, huh?

Elena:
Forget me and Joyce, how many days have you gone without sleep? I've seen the wrappers filling up your lab's trash can over the past week. Agrypnotics, huh?

Dorothy:
The experiment's already in its final phase. I promised the participants I'd accelerate the pace, so they can get back to their families sooner.

Elena:
Got me there. Who doesn't want this done sooner?

Elena:
Plus, as your assistant, I have to listen to you anyway.

Dorothy:
Alright—can I ask my beloved assistant to do me another little favor, then?

Dorothy:
I can't be out of the lab for too long. I want you to courier these heat-emitter modules to some friends outside.

Elena:
Heat-emitters? We've been in the barrens for over a month. Where'd you buy these?

Dorothy:
I...

Elena:
See? It took me and Joyce one look to know you made these with lab materials.

Elena:
The living fossils up in Business won't like that. You might be Director of Originium Arts Director, but that's not gonna change their tune any.

Dorothy:
I know how their minds work.

Dorothy:
And I know even better that you won't report something this minor to Ferdinand, or any of the Directors for that matter.

Elena:
......

Dorothy:
They need these things. It's been getting cold lately, and their huts weren't built to last. They won't keep the chills out.

Elena:
Dorothy.

Elena:
I've been wanting to say... Don't you think you worry too much about them?

Elena:
They're... Pioneers. A team of them in Rhine Lab's employ.

Elena:
No Pioneer's gonna hang around anywhere for long, let alone make friends.

Dorothy:
They're just a bunch of kids.

Dorothy:
Besides, I know what you're trying to say. You're worried about me. You're worried I'll feel empty once they're gone.

Dorothy:
That's my little assistant, always so considerate...

Elena:
Don't grin at me like that. You're not my teacher, Director Franks.

Dorothy:
Elena...

Elena:
Fine, I'll do you this one last favor. The very last one.

Elena:
Seeing as... the experiment's nearly over.

Pioneer:
Sir, we're all set.

Sonny:
......

Pioneer:
Sonny... Sir?

Sonny:
Huh?

Pioneer:
Got the heebie-jeebies?

Sonny:
What? Nah, that's never been my style.

Pioneer:
You've been pacing laps about the cabin. Seven, coming up eight.

Sonny:
I'm just, uh... I'm getting my mind in order. Lotta variables, what's coming up next.

Pioneer:
Sonny, I've been thinking, but, uh, are we really on the right track here?

Sonny:
......

Pioneer:
Them scientists, and the doc, they've been plenty good to us, I say.

Sonny:
I told y'all already, one or two acts of kindness don't make a saint.

Sonny:
Back in law school, my classmates loved to all that charitable business—

Sonny:
You know, donate a thing or three to treatment zones for Infected, maybe join a campus debate for justice, for what they went through.

Sonny:
But once I came to be an unlucky, ill-ridden son-of-a-gun too, well, guess how many times they visited me?

Pioneer:
Yeah?

Sonny:
Not a single goddamned time.

Sonny:
A year back, I went to borrow some money from an old college roommate. He worked at the biggest law firm in Max D.C.

Sonny:
Picked up the phone, get this. He asked me who I was.

Sonny:
'Sorry, you were out deferred for treatment, so that's why the grad yearbook didn't have your contact.' —Ha!

Sonny:
Most touching joke I ever heard, I tell you.

Pioneer:
Real band of bastards, huh? We've seen plenty of 'em ourselves, all of us.

Sonny:
Once they're at a safe enough distance, it stokes their egos good to throw out a little benevolence, like they're feeding fowl, and it makes a topic for their get-togethers too.

Sonny:
You go on and guess... if right this moment, in that laboratory, those respectable scientists are cradling their coffee cups talking about us, huh?

Sonny:
Nobody minds doling out good intent, not until it costs them anything for real.

Pioneer:
Alright, boss, whatever you say.

Pioneer:
You seen the most of us, paid it most mind. Your word is gold.

Sonny:
This is the only way we've got.

Sonny:
Nobody in the whole damned test site's gonna look out for us, 'cept ourselves.

Elena:
C'mon, Joyce, once I finish my coffee, we've got to get to work.

Pioneer:
Medic... we need a medic!

Elena:
You're one of the Pioneers?

Elena:
You can't really just come in... uh, you haven't gone through decontam yet...

Pioneer:
Don't you have a medic or a doctor? Something came over Sam all of a sudden, he's sick!

Elena:
Sick...? Is it Oripathy?!

Pioneer:
Are you? Are you a doctor? You gotta save him, you gotta save ol' Sam, save us all!

Pioneer:
He's been running like a kettle since late last night, and he's just started throwing up blood!

Pioneer:
He's in the nearest hut... We did like you told us last time, gave him some painkillers, laid him down.

Elena:
Joyce...!

Elena:
I... I know.

Elena:
I'm not trying to stop you, even if we're shattering safety regulations...

Elena:
Joyce, I'm gonna go with you.

Elena:
Who gives two cares? Remember, I took basic medical training too. An extra pair of helping hands can't hurt in a situation like this, right?

Elena:
Plus I've gotta make the trip anyway, with my errand from Dorothy. Might as well be now.

Pioneer:
Here!

Elena:
Where's the patient?

Elena:
Out of the way! Every second counts with acute Oripathy onset!

Pioneer:
......

Elena:
But...

Pioneer:
Don't move!

Elena:
Is that... a nail gun?

Elena:
Sure aren't, Joyce. These are some healthy young men here.

Elena:
Wouldn't have the strength to be pointing dangerous tools at us otherwise.

???:
Hands up, ladies.

Elena:
You're... the leader of the Pioneer Team.

Sonny:
You remember me? I admit I'm a touch surprised.

Elena:
Sir, why have you tricked me and Joyce into coming here?

Sonny:
I trust you know, Urbica... Dr. Urbica.

Sonny:
That's how you say your surname, right?

Elena:
You pronounced it beautifully...

Sonny:
Gonna trouble you to lend us your communicator there, Doc.

Sonny:
Pioneer Team needs to ask your superiors a few questions.
