Ptilopsis:
...Sonny.

Ptilopsis:
We did this of our own volition.

Sonny:
I don't get it, Doc Moore... who are you talking for here?

Ptilopsis:
......

Ptilopsis:
Message.

Ptilopsis:
I received a message, one that is different from that previous ones.

Ptilopsis:
Hngh...

Silence:
Does your head hurt again, Joyce?

Ptilopsis:
There is nothing wrong with me physically, Dr. Silence.

Ptilopsis:
Detecting unexpected data transmission. Processing.

Sonny:
Data?

Ptilopsis:
Yes... Sonny, we all know...

Ptilopsis:
This is... a gamble.

Ptilopsis:
The results are... unpredictable. But this was our choice.

Ptilopsis:
Data transmission terminated. Analysis indicates that Sonny is the intended recipient.

Sonny:
Doc Moore, you're talking like one of our... no, one of the test subjects lying there.

Ptilopsis:
Hypothesis cannot be confirmed.

Ptilopsis:
The source of the data is unknown. I simply sensed it.

Sonny:
Doc Silence, is she right? Doc Moore can hear my friends?!

Silence:
Joyce, was your use of the word 'sense' intentional?

Ptilopsis:
Yes, Dr. Silence.

Ptilopsis:
The content of the dream has changed.

Silence:
What did you see?

Ptilopsis:
Analysis failed.

Elena:
Your eyes look different... are you feeling sad?

Ptilopsis:
Detecting signal fluctuations in peripheral system.

Ptilopsis:
...Della.

Silence:
Dellareed? Are you thinking of her again? Does Device #9 have something to do with Director Franks's experiments?

Ptilopsis:
Motive, emotion, not logical connections.

Ptilopsis:
Dr. Silence, I sense that this was our own choice.

Silence:
Your own choice?

Silence:
......

Silence:
Sonny, if I guarantee that I will do all that can be done to correct the wrongs, will you let Dorothy Franks go?

Sonny:
Listen, Doc Silence, we appreciate your help getting us here, and that you got us to the truth about the experiments.

Sonny:
We can definitely believe you're on our side.

Sonny:
But can you really be sure she won't start it all back up again?

Dorothy:
......

Silence:
No, I can't.

Silence:
But if she does, I will handle her for you.

Elena:
Whew... the experiments have been suspended, Dorothy is unharmed, and the test subjects are regaining consciousness.

Elena:
I still find all this hard to believe.

Ptilopsis:
There is no cause for alarm. Emotional fluctuations are normal.

Elena:
You woke up just in time, Joyce.

Elena:
I've never seen Olivia that angry... I thought she would just leave Dorothy to her own devices.

Elena:
But I still don't understand how you heard the voices of the test subjects.

Elena:
Their consciousnesses were linked by Dorothy's 'Hub', but how did you get involved?

Elena:
Didn't you say Device #9 had nothing to do with the 'Hub'?

Ptilopsis:
Insufficient data available.

Ptilopsis:
But I heard the voice of Mr. Myers when I woke up from my dream.

Elena:
When you woke up...

Elena:
The conflict in the corridor? Why would that wake you, when the battle before didn't?

Elena:
This is all so strange...

Elena:
Anyway, I guess all's well that ends well. Thanks to Olivia.

Ptilopsis:
Dr. Silence has met expectations.

Elena:
She's changed so much, come to think of it.

Elena:
When I first met her, she was just one of many students you'd see on a college campus, shy, introverted, unremarkable.

Ptilopsis:
This description matches my memory.

Elena:
I could hardly recognize her when she was pressing Dorothy for answers, only to step in to protect her.

Elena:
It was like I saw... a shadow of someone else.

Ptilopsis:
That of Director Saria?

Elena:
H-How did you know?

Elena:
Don't tell Olivia I said that!

Ptilopsis:
Dr. Silence won't let this affect her friendship with you.

Elena:
I know.

Elena:
But as her friend, I don't want to remind her of her unpleasant past.

Ptilopsis:
Understood.

Elena:
Let's go. I should finish my job too.

Elena:
Communications have yet to be restored... not good. The boss...

Elena:
And my sister... how many messages have I been getting?

Silence:
Please come with me, Director Franks. It's time to leave.

Dorothy:
One moment, please.

Dorothy:
With the experiments halted, they will wipe this lab off the map.

Dorothy:
There's something I have to take with me.

Silence:
It's... a photo?

Dorothy:
Yes.

Silence:
A photo of a group of Pioneers...

Silence:
Is this girl... you?

Dorothy:
I meant every word I said to Sonny.

Dorothy:
My mother, my whole family... they were all Pioneers.

Dorothy:
From a young age I heard them talk about their dreams and saw their struggles with my own eyes.

Dorothy:
They gave me a chance to chase my own dreams.

Dorothy:
But most Pioneers will never know the luck that came to me.

Silence:
What happened to your family?

Dorothy:
Most of them have left me.

Dorothy:
When I was invited to attend Ironforge Polytechnic's summer camp for 'talented students'...

Dorothy:
A Catastrophe destroyed my mother's camp.

Dorothy:
She never heard about my miraculous acceptance, or my scholarship.

Silence:
I'm sorry...

Dorothy:
Was it really the right choice to stop these experiments?

Dorothy:
Those Pioneers, those whose lives hang by a thread, they live each day not knowing if they'll see the next.

Dorothy:
I could have helped them...

Dorothy:
They didn't have to be swallowed up by the sand in despair, like my family was.

Silence:
......

Parvis:
Why do you ask this, Silence?

Parvis:
Without our experiments, the child would not have lasted more than a few days after leaving Haydn 1.

Parvis:
We saved her life. She wants for nothing, and will contribute to scientific advancement.

Parvis:
How lucky is she, compared to all those children who die of Oripathy in the barrenlands?

Parvis:
I trusted you, put you in charge of her. Yet you make such petty accusations towards me, towards science itself?

Silence:
I don't know.

Silence:
This is not a question for me to answer.

Silence:
Joyce reminded me...

Silence:
I should not judge things by my own standards, even if I can never accept what you did.

Silence:
Did we not choose to be tormented by uncertainty and self-doubt?

Silence:
As researchers, it's our duty to seek the answer ourselves.

Ferdinand:
Is everything ready?

Rhine Defense Member:
Our team has entered the site and is approaching the lab area.

Ferdinand:
Good. Get ready.

Ferdinand:
Colonel, I know there have been delays, but if you give me a little more time...

Colonel's Voice:
You never told me there were other people at the site, Clooney.

Ferdinand:
Do you mean the pharmaceutical company?

Ferdinand:
There's nothing to worry about. They're partnered with Rhine Lab. I will...

Colonel's Voice:
I don't need your promises.

Colonel's Voice:
All I need here is results.

Ferdinand:
I apologize. This is just a small hiccup...

Colonel's Voice:
If you can't deliver results, then you have to at least stop making trouble for me.

Colonel's Voice:
You'd do well to remember that.

Ferdinand:
......

Rhine Defense Member:
Can we proceed, Director Clooney?

Ferdinand:
We don't have a choice.

Rhine Defense Member:
Understood.

Ferdinand:
One more thing.

Ferdinand:
Put me on spec com.

Elena:
Huh... communications have been restored?

Ferdinand:
Elena.

Elena:
Director?

Elena:
I'm so glad it's you. I've been trying to reach you... did you get my message? I put everything that happened here in my report.

Elena:
Something's wrong with Dorothy... Director Franks's experiments. But Silence and I have things under control.

Elena:
We've settled things with the Pioneers. They're leaving the labs as we speak.

Ferdinand:
I know.

Elena:
You... you do? Oh wow...

Ferdinand:
You did your job. The cleanup detail is on the way in.

Elena:
Defense? They're finally here?

Elena:
Whew, that's a relief. I was worried about the Transmitter we've been storing here.

Ferdinand:
They know what to do. You can leave now.

Elena:
I should stay and help. Next to Dorothy, I'm the most familiar with these experiments.

Ferdinand:
I'm at the observation station, Elena. Two directors are more than enough to handle the situation, don't you agree?

Elena:
Er, that's not what I meant...

Ferdinand:
Then listen to me and leave the site immediately.

Elena:
May I ask why?

Ferdinand:
No, you may not waste my time with meaningless questions. I want you in the control room, now.

Elena:
Yes... sir.

Elena:
......

Ptilopsis:
Is there a problem, Researcher Urbica?

Elena:
The director... Ferdinand wants me to leave immediately.

Ptilopsis:
Leave?

Elena:
Go and let Olivia know that the Defense Section is coming.

Ptilopsis:
What about you? Are you leaving?

Elena:
I... something's not right with the director. If... if he didn't know how far Dorothy went, why is he completely unconcerned about what happened to the experiments?

Rhine Defense Member:
Director Clooney, Miss Urbica is not leaving the labs.

Ferdinand:
......

Rhine Defense Member:
Should we adjust the plan?

Ferdinand:
No.

Ferdinand:
Proceed.

Sonny:
Is everybody out?

Pioneer Team Member:
Yes, sir.

Rhine Defense Member:
Next.

Sonny:
What are they doing?

Pioneer Team Member:
They say it's a 'precautionary measure'. Probably a sedative or something.

Pioneer Team Member:
I guess we made a little too much noise, huh?

Sonny:
Don't forget what I said. If anyone asks, I was the one behind everything.

Pioneer Team Member:
Don't worry, no one's letting you take all the credit.

Sonny:
But...

Rhine Defense Member:
Next.

Sonny:
Sonny Romano.

Rhine Defense Member:
Wasn't asking for your name.

Sonny:
Tell your leader that I take sole responsibility for the kidnapping.

Rhine Defense Member:
......

Rhine Defense Member:
Right hand.

Sonny:
Are you gonna get to it after the injection?

Sonny:
What the...? Doc Urbica? Why'd you push me?

Elena:
Don't take the shot!

Rhine Defense Member:
You're interfering with our work, researcher.

Elena:
I developed that stuff in that syringe.

Elena:
Need me to explain what it's for?

Sonny:
Huh? Aren't they with you and Doc Silence?

Elena:
Why do you always doubt the people you should trust, when you're so eager to trust people you should doubt?

Elena:
Take that band off, quick!

Sonny:
The treatment wristband?

Elena:
I remembered why Joyce woke up when I saw the syringes in their hands!

Elena:
It's this—the treatment bands!

Elena:
The ones you got have been modified. There's a sensor on them similar to the equipment in Dorothy's lab. If it comes into contact with Transmitter...

Elena:
I need to report to the director. Someone is behind all this, using... using...

Elena:
Dammit, communications are down again?

Sonny:
What's the matter?

Elena:
......

Elena:
I... I get it now.

Elena:
All this time...

Sonny:
Doc Urbica, are you okay? Are you crying?

Elena:
Crying? No, I just...

Elena:
It's not important.

Elena:
This isn't over, Sonny. Dorothy was never your enemy!
