Mechanist:
All six power armors disabled.

Saria:
Is that the last one?

Mechanist:
Looks like it. We were delayed thirteen minutes.

Mechanist:
Wait.

Mechanist:
Scans show a seventh!

Strange power armor:
—

Mechanist:
It's headed your way, Doctor!

Strange power armor:
—

Saria:
I'll take care of it.

You did not see how Saria moved. All you know is that she was standing in front of you before you knew it.

You know she never carries a Rhine-made shield on the streets of Columbia.

She turns herself into a shield.

The enamel barrier growing from her crossed forearms blocks the power armor's attack.

Saria:
Pest.

You hear Saria mutter under her breath.

That is how she views such rogue Columbian technology.

Her expression tells you what her next move is.

Saria wastes no time dealing with pests.

Her hand closes upon the chest of the power armor, where a dark hole would soon appear.

The power armor would be destroyed, or more aptly, die.

A thought comes to your mind.

She may or may not have heard more than the first syllable, but she does, in fact, stop.

It is the result of trust that you have accumulated over the course of many battles.

Her fist only scrapes the core, but the shockwave is enough to shatter the power armor's outer shell.

You see something amongst the flying metal shards that looks different.

It looks like... strands of hair.

Mechanist:
Doctor! Look ou—

Saria:
It's...

The power armor tips over.

As it further disintegrates, you see more hair, then a speck of skin, then an eye.

The eye is looking at you.

You see many emotions flash across it: anger, fear, bewilderment...

As the shell falls away completely, you realize it is begging for help.

You extend your hand.

Sonny:
What's happening, Myers?

Pioneer Team Member:
I... I don't know, sir...

Sonny:
Let Doc Moore go.

Pioneer Team Member:
Doc...

Ptilopsis:
......

Pioneer Team Member:
I can't.

Sonny:
Disobeying a direct order?

Pioneer Team Member:
Why are you on their side, sir?

Pioneer Team Member:
Didn't you say we needed to harden our hearts and do what we had to do? Didn't you say we were just their test subjects?

Pioneer Team Member:
This was all your idea. I... I liked Doc Moore.

Sonny:
I never thought you'd be the one to turn against me first.

Sonny:
Sam, maybe, or somebody else... but you, Myers, you always listened to me.

Pioneer Team Member:
To a fault, you said.

Pioneer Team Member:
I listened to my boss at the plant and ended up with Oripathy. Then I started listening to you when I got here.

Pioneer Team Member:
You're all smart, got an education. Figured I couldn't go wrong listening to you.

Pioneer Team Member:
But now... we're all gonna die.

Pioneer Team Member:
The whitecoats are gonna kill us, Sonny! They think they got it all under control!

Elena:
......

Pioneer Team Member:
Search her if you don't believe me. I'm damned sure she's got a voice recorder on her. She's here to log us, and the silver monsters.

Sonny:
Dr. Urbica, if you know a way out of this, it's time to get talking.

Silence:
Elena...

Elena:
Olivia, I may not have told you the details of the experiment...

Elena:
But I'll never lie to you.

Elena:
I never lied to you either, Sonny, Myers.

Elena:
I... I don't know how to deal with them.

Elena:
I studied them and recorded their behavior because I wanted to solve the problem we're facing... like I said, it's part of my job.

Silence:
Hm...

Silence:
I think Elena's telling the truth, Myers.

Silence:
Would you give Joyce back to us?

Pioneer Team Member:
Ha... haha....

The Pioneer stares at Ptilopsis. Suddenly, he raises his hand.

Silence lets out a mute cry. Her drone rams the Pioneer, sensing its master's will.

But all he did was take something from Ptilopsis's hand.

It was the treatment band that he put on her only a few hours ago.

Ptilopsis:
......

Pioneer Team Member:
What... what have I done...?

Pioneer Team Member:
Doc Moore...

Pioneer Team Member:
You regret it, huh? The kindness you showed me?

Pioneer Team Member:
Someone like me doesn't deserve kindness.

The doctor returns to the side of her friends, still quiet, beautiful, pristine.

But there is no way out. This lab is a tomb, built specially for them.

There is no hope. The band is like a handcuff the company has shackled them with.

They will never find freedom, unless...

The Pioneer stuffs the medical wristband into his mouth.

Sonny:
Myers!

Pioneer Team Member:
S-Sir...

Sonny:
What are you doing! Spit it out, now!

Silence:
The band...

Elena:
It contains multiple doses of painkillers.

Elena:
His heart can't possibly take it. It'll kill him!

Pioneer Team Member:
I've seen guys swallow these...

Sonny:
They're all dead!

Pioneer Team Member:
The dead are the lucky ones...

Sonny:
Spit it out, damn you!

Sonny:
I'll hold his jaw. Sock him in the stomach, Sam!

Pioneer Team Member:
*cough* *cough*

Sonny:
One more time! I see the treatment band!

Elena:
Olivia, let's help—

Elena:
...Olivia?

Silence:
...Joyce.

Ptilopsis:
......

Ptilopsis:
—Program start.

Elena:
She's awake?!

Ptilopsis:
It's so dark...

Ptilopsis:
Why is it so dark outside...?

Elena:
Dark? But all the lights are on.

Elena:
Joyce... are your eyes okay?

Ptilopsis:
...Light.

Ptilopsis:
Light... need light... warmth...

Ptilopsis:
Forward...

Ptilopsis:
Fearless...

Elena:
Can you hear us?

Silence:
She can't.

Elena:
What's going on?

Silence:
I don't know, but none of that sounds like Joyce.

Elena:
Her condition...

Silence:
I know her. She's never sounded like this, before or after the operation.

Elena:
You're right.

Silence:
You're surprised. You don't know what's happening to her.

Silence:
That means the situation has long gone out of your control.

Silence:
Elena... it's time to talk about these experiments.

Elena:
Did Dorothy...?

Elena:
I don't want to see anyone get hurt because of our work. Especially not Joyce.

Elena:
Maybe you're right. We should have worked together to solve the problem.

Gentle Female Voice:
It's ok, Elena. No need to hesitate anymore.

Gentle Female Voice:
I invited all of you here. You have the right to know the truth, both Dr. Silence, and my Pioneer friends.

Sonny:
You were... spying on us?

Gentle Female Voice:
I was concerned.

Gentle Female Voice:
Someone needs to close the doors while you stop to talk.

Sonny:
You stopped the silver monsters?

Gentle Female Voice:
Don't call them that, Sonny.

Gentle Female Voice:
They can hear you.

Sonny:
......

Gentle Female Voice:
Elena, my dear assistant, there's one more thing that I require of you.

Gentle Female Voice:
Bring them to me.

Gentle Female Voice:
What you don't feel comfortable explaining, I can.

Gentle Female Voice:
And you know my lab is the safest.

Greyy:
No hostiles left outside.

Greyy:
They all followed Mr. Sonny and Dr. Silence.

Greyy:
Communications are still out.

Greyy:
Looks like jamming across all standard frequencies. Mechanist might have been able to do something about it...

Greyy:
Who's there?

Greyy:
Mr. Sonny?

???:
Freeze.

Greyy:
That voice...

Greyy:
Miss Mary?

Mary:
Looks like you've got a decent memory.

Greyy:
Why... why are you here?

Mary:
Where is he?

Greyy:
He... you mean Mr. Sonny?

Mary:
Tell him to show himself and stop hiding behind a child like a coward!

Greyy:
Er, I'm a grown man...

Mary:
Just barely.

Mary:
Out with it, boy. Where are they?

Greyy:
The Pioneers are in a building nearby...

Mary:
Do you know your ears twitch when you're embarrassed?

Greyy:
Er... huh?

Mary:
Just kidding.

Mary:
But you're a little too trusting, aren't you?

Mary:
This will go a lot easier if you tell me everything you know.

Mary:
Otherwise, since you're the one who fixed the power supply, I can arrest you for obstruction of justice.

Mary:
If I can't catch the real perp, I guess you'll have to do.

Greyy:
No, please... don't...

Greyy:
I-I don't want to cause trouble for the Doctor.

Mary:
Then what are you waiting for? Start talking.

Greyy:
I'm not sure if you'll believe me...

Greyy:
We were attacked by a bunch of silver shapeshifters, the likes of which we've never seen before.

Sonny:
So, she's inside.

Elena:
Yes. This is Dorothy's lab, and the heart of the complex.

Sonny:
You sure?

Silence:
What's the matter, Sonny?

Sonny:
Nothing.

Sonny:
It's wicked stressful, getting so close to the truth.

Sonny:
Remember what I said, Sam. Be ready.

Pioneer Team Member:
Yes, sir.

Sonny:
Can you open the door, Dr. Urbica?

Elena:
Of course.

Silence:
(Elena.)

Elena:
(Huh?)

Silence:
(Something feels off with the Pioneers.)

Elena:
(But we've come this far.)

Elena:
(You convinced me that we're all here to solve the same problem, Olivia.)

Silence:
(I'm not so sure anymore...)

Sonny:
Clock's ticking, Doctor.

Gentle Female Voice:
Same here.

Gentle Female Voice:
Come in, please.

Elena's hand never touched the scanner.

But the doors of the lab open to the true master of the house.

Dorothy:
Hello, everyone.

Dorothy:
I'm the Director of Rhine Lab's Originium Art Section, and the overseer of Test Site 359.

Dorothy:
Welcome, all, to my laboratory.

Sonny:
So we're here at last...

Sonny:
Sam. Get her!
