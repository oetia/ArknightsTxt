Ferdinand:
Here, the data you asked for.

Dorothy:
Thanks, Ferdinand. I didn't think you'd hand it over personally.

Ferdinand:
We were able to retrieve most of the Loken Watertank data thanks to you. The fewer that know about this, the better.

Ferdinand:
And I'm curious as to why you wanted these data.

Dorothy:
......

She gazes at the monitor in front of her, so focused that even her breathing slows down.

A video of a girl with white hair is playing.

The girl spends most of her time sleeping, eating, or sitting in a corner with a blank look on her face.

From time to time, she is led into a lab, where she crushes furniture placed in a room separated by a 1-meter thick wall.

Dorothy:
What a beautiful child.

Ferdinand:
You remind me of Loken Williams. I thought only madmen boast about their test subjects.

Dorothy:
Sure, he's been accused of crossing a moral line.

Ferdinand:
Morals are shackles that the short-sighted impose upon themselves.

Ferdinand:
Science has never been bound by common sense. There is no greater insult to a scientist than to be judged by moral standards.

Ferdinand:
Williams's problem was that he allowed the infinite unknown to get the better of his sanity, and he abandoned the logic and reason a scientist must grip.

Ferdinand:
See at the end of the video how your 'beautiful child' turned the lab into a nightmarish catastrophe.

The monitor is showing a different image.

There is no recorded sound, but the screams seem to pierce the screen and fill a lab from another time.

The fallen debris does not hide the bloodstains.

Dorothy:
......

Dorothy:
What happened to the girl?

Ferdinand:
Records pertaining to her have been tampered with. Like the other legacies of Loken Watertank, she has value to somebody, somewhere.

Dorothy:
I want to find her.

Ferdinand:
......

Ferdinand:
May I assume you're considering ending Williams's experiments?

Ferdinand:
She is too difficult to control. A risk Rhine Lab cannot afford.

Dorothy:
She didn't volunteer to be a test subject. I can't ask something so cruel of her.

Ferdinand:
You want to heal her?

Ferdinand:
We're not doctors, but anyone whose seen the experiments in their entirety should not harbor such delusions.

Dorothy:
No, Ferdinand.

Dorothy:
All I want to do is find her... and give her a hug.

Ferdinand:
A... a hug?

Dorothy:
The girl... she's all alone.

Dorothy:
They took her family from her, and made her something entirely different from all other people.

Dorothy:
I can't help but think... where is she now?

Dorothy:
Has she made new friends? Or new enemies?

Dorothy:
I want to hear her voice...

Dorothy:
I can't change her past, but the future may not be lost yet.

Ferdinand:
You know, Dorothy... I really have no idea what you're thinking at times.

Ferdinand:
Not many scientists are as sentimental as you are. You're not bound by logic or reason either. Perhaps, one day, your madness will put Williams's to shame...

Dorothy:
Madness? I've seen this in my dreams, many times.

Dorothy:
That's why I want to find the girl.

Dorothy:
If she's still alive... if anyone can save her from her past...

Dorothy:
Then maybe someone will be there to stop me, if I really do go over the edge.
