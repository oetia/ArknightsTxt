Mechanist:
Composition analysis failed.

Mechanist:
Liquid does not match any known compound.

Saria:
Look.

White crystals form at her fingertips, spreading to cover her entire hand and forearm.

It is a scene that you just saw, and which is as familiar to you from combat reports as from your own experience.

Saria does not answer.

Suddenly, she raises her hand, and you find her fist in front of your nose faster than you can blink.

You hear the sound of mineral impacting metal, and know that Mechanist blocked the attack for you.

Before you can catch your breath, you feel something cold touch your neck.

Saria's other hand never moved.

But there is a calcified blade at your throat, nonetheless.

You instinctively hold your breath.

Mechanist:
Explain yourself, Saria.

Saria:
This is the quickest way to explain it.

Saria:
My Originium Arts reconstruct matter containing calcium, at a molecular level. This is what you call calcification.

Saria:
I can control the enamel formed this way using my mind, without the need to move.

Saria:
No radio signals or programs.

Saria:
They are like an extension of my limbs.

Mechanist:
Do you mean the power armor—

Saria:
A power armor is nothing more than a power armor.

Saria:
This silvery liquid is the key.

Saria:
It's the neurotransmitter of the power armor, linking the brainwaves of the operator to the machine.

Mechanist:
Like an Arts Unit?

Saria:
More than that, I should say.

Saria:
Sorry if I've caused any discomfort.

Mechanist:
I would not have gone for the Doctor's hand, were it not for that gesture to me.

Saria:
Good thing we know each other so well.

Saria:
There's someone I want to see.

Saria:
As far as I know, he's the first to actually use this prototype power armor.

Saria:
I would like you to come, with Mechanist.

Ho'olheyak:
You saw them go into a bar near the university?

Columbian Mercenary:
Yes, ma'am. All three of them.

Ho'olheyak:
I can guess who it is Saria's looking for.

Ho'olheyak:
We just saw him last week.

Columbian Mercenary:
Didn't he agree not to meet anyone from Rhine Lab?

Ho'olheyak:
Is Saria still Rhine?

Ho'olheyak:
I don't think she knows the answer herself.

Columbian Mercenary:
Should we stop them?

Ho'olheyak:
No.

Ho'olheyak:
I'm curious how much Saria knows.

Ho'olheyak:
It's about time we had a talk.

Ho'olheyak:
And one more thing... Loken Williams is a graduate of the Trimounts Institute of Technology.

Columbian Mercenary:
Loken Williams...? Who is that?

Ho'olheyak:
I guess time really does fly.

Ho'olheyak:
One accident, and everyone forgets the brightest star of academia.

Ho'olheyak:
Saria and the Control of Rhine Lab went to the same school.

Ho'olheyak:
Social gatherings in Columbia's tech sector are basically all TIT reunions.

Ho'olheyak:
I wish I could've spent some time at that school myself.

Ho'olheyak:
Let's go. Maybe it's not too late to join the fun.

Pioneer Team Member:
The last fire bomb!

Sonny:
Throw it! Far as you can!

Pioneer Team Member:
Here goes!

Sonny:
With me! Get inside!

Sonny:
We got everybody?

Pioneer Team Member:
Whew... yes, sir. All present and accounted for.

Sonny:
What about the monsters?

Pioneer Team Member:
Not yet. The flask's still burning, looks like it's got their attention.

Silence:
Thank you, everyone.

Silence:
We have all of the injured.

Sonny:
What's next, Doc Silence?

Pioneer Team Member:
Sir, the door—

Pioneer Team Member:
It won't open! What the hell is going on?!

Sonny:
You lock that door, Doc?

Silence:
I've never been to this test site before.

Sonny:
Dr. Urbica?

Elena:
The lab doors are automatic.

Pioneer Team Member:
But it's locked!

Elena:
......

Sonny:
Doctor...

Elena:
What are you complaining about? Aren't you afraid of those silver constructs outside?

Pioneer Team Member:
How're we supposed to know if you're trying to keep them out, or keep us in?

Pioneer Team Member:
Maybe you planned all this!

Elena:
Are you joking?

Elena:
Hah! You're saying I somehow made you kidnap me?

Pioneer Team Member:
Watch it! You're our prisoner, don't forget!

Sonny:
Sam!

Pioneer Team Member:
You're the one who said these whitecoats are fooling us!

Sonny:
No, be quiet for a sec—

Sonny:
You hear it, Doc Silence? A rustle, like something slithering on the ground...

Silence:
......

Gentle Female Voice:
Do not stop, and do not look back.

Gentle Female Voice:
Push open the third door on your right.

Pioneer Team Member:
It opened!

Gentle Female Voice:
Do not be afraid. I will protect you.

Gentle Female Voice:
As always.

Ferdinand:
Test results for the latest batch of Transmitter?

Rhine Lab Tech:
Yes, sir.

Rhine Lab Tech:
In a laboratory environment, of course...

Ferdinand:
A one-point-seven percent increase in efficiency.

Ferdinand:
A massive breakthrough in one month.

Ferdinand:
Excellent work. Do you need more time? Ten days? Twenty?

Rhine Lab Tech:
S-Sorry! Whoa...

???:
Come now, don't frighten the youths like that.

???:
No wonder the staff so fear the accolades of the Director of Energy.

Ferdinand:
Come to boast about your people skills, Parvis?

Parvis:
Just passing through.

Parvis:
Back to your lab now, poor little fellow, I'll keep your director company for a bit.

Rhine Lab Tech:
Er, alright, ok!

Rhine Lab Tech:
Thank you...

Parvis:
Ahah! So quick on his feet. Such is youth, eh? Gone in a flash.

Ferdinand:
I don't see you outside your lab often, except for directors' meetings.

Ferdinand:
What brings you here, exactly?

Parvis:
Where do I even start? The brain doesn't spin so fast at my age.

Ferdinand:
You were born with white hair, Caprinae.

Parvis:
Haha.

Parvis:
Oh, now I remember. Do you know where Muelsyse is?

Ferdinand:
......

Parvis:
We made a bet. She wagered ten boxes of black bean tea from hydroponics in Ecological.

Ferdinand:
A bet?

Parvis:
Two days ago, she told me that you were planning to rid Ferdinand Clooney's name of the 'Director' title.

Silence:
Sonny...?

Sonny:
......

Silence:
Why did you stop?

Sonny:
We can't do this.

Silence:
Do what?

Sonny:
We can't follow that voice.

Silence:
The voice... you mean Director Franks?

Silence:
Sonny, Director Franks knows this lab better than anyone, better than Elena or myself. She knows where we'll be safe.

Sonny:
That's why I don't trust her!

Sonny:
Don't you see? She's pulling our strings, guiding every step, drilling into our minds...

Sonny:
She's walking us right into her cage, and we're going along with it!

Silence:
Please calm down, Sonny. Getting excited could exacerbate your condition.

Sonny:
Lemme go! Get away from me!

Silence:
Oof...

Elena:
Olivia! Are you okay?

Silence:
I'm fine.

Elena:
That's enough, Pioneer.

Elena:
I would have left you outside, if Olivia didn't insist we help you.

Pioneer Team Member:
Ha, like we wanted to be here with you in the first place.

Elena:
I don't understand. At all.

Elena:
Dorothy was so kind to you.

Dorothy:
How's your son, Dirk?

Pioneer Team Member:
Not so good, Director Franks. The doctor says he needs an operation.

Pioneer Team Member:
But...

Dorothy:
Is it the cost?

Pioneer Team Member:
Nothing gets past you. I joined the Pioneer Team to try to help my boy. This is my first project.

Pioneer Team Member:
We don't have much money. I shouldn't've spent any on Oripathy medicine. If only I knew my son had heart trouble.

Pioneer Team Member:
There's no hope for me, but him... he's still so little...

Dorothy:
Don't worry, Dirk. I know a way.

Dorothy:
Here's the best heart surgeon I know. Take your son and find her.

Pioneer Team Member:
The best surgeon? In Trimounts?

Pioneer Team Member:
Must be awful pricey...

Dorothy:
She's an old classmate of mine. Tell her Dorothy Franks sent you, and she'll give you a discount.

Pioneer Team Member:
R-Really?

Dorothy:
Don't tell anybody. It'd be bad for her reputation if word got out that she gives discounts.

Pioneer Team Member:
Won't tell a soul! Cross my heart!

Pioneer Team Member:
I... I gotta go! Thank your friend for me!

Elena:
......

Dorothy:
Why are you standing there? The coffee's getting cold.

Elena:
So much the better.

Elena:
It'll hurt less when I spill it on you.

Dorothy:
Are you worried about me, or the coffee?

Elena:
......

Elena:
You can smile and plead all you want, but I'm not lending you lunch money.

Dorothy:
Looks like it's plain rice for the rest of the month then.

Elena:
A director of Rhine Lab, begging for food from a low-level researcher... can you imagine the scandal?

Dorothy:
Originium Art Section is the poorest of the five, after all.

Dorothy:
I'm not Ferdinand, I don't have sponsors lined up waiting to dress me in gold from head to tail.

Elena:
At least the boss has good taste.

Elena:
Back on topic, it's not like I don't know the classmate you're talking about. She probably couldn't wait to double her fee when she heard your name.

Elena:
You're willing to pay anything for your Pioneer friends. No wonder people take advantage of you.

Dorothy:
Hahah...

Elena:
Laugh all you want. Not like I can do anything about it.

Elena:
I'm going back to my lab.

Elena:
Maybe finishing this experiment will help stuff your wallet a little.

Elena:
She did so much for you, and pushed me into keeping it secret.

Elena:
How could you do this to her?

Sonny:
Dr. Urbica, you're Dorothy Franks's friend.

Sonny:
You see only what she wants you to see.

Sonny:
You don't know what terrible things she's hiding under the surface.

Pioneer Team Member:
Director Franks! My boy's surgery went great. The doctor says he'll be out of the hospital by next week!

Dorothy:
Fantastic. Would you like to go home and see him?

Pioneer Team Member:
G-Go home? Back to the city?

Pioneer Team Member:
B-But I'm Infected. I can't enter a nomadic city on my own...

Dorothy:
Unless you have a new contract that pays for the insurance.

Dorothy:
You're looking at a chance, Dirk. One that can change your destiny.

Dorothy:
Sign this consent form, and you'll be able to go home.

Pioneer Team Member:
Of course I...

Dorothy:
No rush. You have twenty-four hours to think about it.

Dorothy:
This isn't a trick, nothing in the fine print.

Dorothy:
I've circled the important points. Make sure you understand the risks.

Dorothy:
Come find me if you have any questions.

Sonny:
Dirk!

Pioneer Team Member:
S-Sir? What're you doing here? Did you sign up for...

Sonny:
Give me the consent form.

Pioneer Team Member:
W-Why? No!

Sonny:
Don't you get it? She's stuffing you into a cage, to experiment on!

Pioneer Team Member:
S-So what?

Pioneer Team Member:
Director Franks says she's giving me a chance.

Pioneer Team Member:
When was the last time we heard the word 'chance'?

Sonny:
......

Pioneer Team Member:
I don't need twenty-four hours.

Pioneer Team Member:
I won't wait another minute for a chance to see my boy!

Sonny:
That's how she got Dirk.

Sonny:
Not just Dirk. Alan, Gale, Sophia...

Sonny:
She knew everyone's weaknesses. No one could say no to her.

Sonny:
That's Dorothy Franks!

Sonny:
Those silver creatures were her...

Elena:
The silver constructs?

Elena:
They're... *cough* *cough*... you know nothing!

Silence:
......

Silence:
How much do the two of you know about our pursuers?

Sonny:
......

Elena:
......

Silence:
One of you calls them creatures, the other uses the word constructs.

Silence:
I'm certain I heard correctly. My people are renowned among Liberi for our sense of hearing.

Sonny:
I'm just guessing.

Elena:
Same here.

Silence:
......

Silence:
At least you agree on something.

Silence:
Never mind that. No matter what you think of Dorothy, at this moment, she's helping us escape.

Silence:
Let's follow her instructions for now.

Silence:
Maybe our pursuers on the other end of the corridor will help you collect your thoughts.
