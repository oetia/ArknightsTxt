That's a dead end. My life would be over.

Greyy:
Sir...? Mr. Sonny?

Sonny:
......

Greyy:
Are you feeling alright? I heard how hard you were breathing.

Sonny:
......!

Greyy:
It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you.

Greyy:
I came here with Dr. Silence, and your men checked us over. We're not carrying any dangerous weapons.

Sonny:
Sorry. I just, uh, force of habit.

Greyy:
No need to apologize. I understand.

Greyy:
It's always hard when the darkness creeps in.

Greyy:
Could you come a little closer? Body heat makes things much warmer. You won't go numb this way, even if you've got to sleep.

Sonny:
Where's the others?

Greyy:
Dr. Silence's medical drone installation has an emergency power source.

Greyy:
She's inside the building right now giving Ptilopsis a health checkup, and Miss Elena's with them too.

Sonny:
Sam's...

Greyy:
He's followed your plan. He got all the Pioneers in poorer health together, in there.

Sonny:
On it.

Sonny:
Lemme ask you a favor. Don't tell Sam, or anyone, how I just, uh...

Greyy:
I understand.

Greyy:
You're their leader. If they thought your strength wasn't holding up at such a key moment, you could lose control of the Pioneer Team.

Sonny:
......

Greyy:
I'm not trying to say your team isn't united enough, but... the darkness usually has a way of pushing on variables.

Sonny:
You've got a mile of experience.

Greyy:
I'm a Bolívarian. Blackouts were pretty common back in the city I'm from.

Sonny:
Bolívar... there's a war there?

Greyy:
We never had an easy guess for where the fires of war would stall out, back home.

Sonny:
Must've been hard for you. Getting yourself out of there, I mean.

Greyy:
It was all thanks to my colleagues.

Greyy:
The way I see it, you and your Pioneer Team are even more amazing.

Sonny:
Me... amazing? Hahah...

Greyy:
Wh-Why are you laughing?

Sonny:
So those stupid company ads made it all the way down to Bolívar?

Greyy:
No, I don't mean like that.

Greyy:
No matter how you look at it, you got here by your own two feet. And the ones who came before you, the immigrants from Victoria, Gaul, and Bolívar...

Greyy:
It's their footprints all together that lit up these wilds.

Sonny:
Hah... you got a way with words.

Greyy:
Eh? I'm just telling it like it is.

Greyy:
I'd always wanted to see what the famous Columbian frontier was like.

Sonny:
Well, you disappointed? Might be more desolate than your hometown here.

Greyy:
No, Mr. Sonny, I think I've learned a lot.

Greyy:
For example, the way your power lines are designed really is economical and efficient, just as Mechanist described.

Rhine Defense Member:
Officer, the vehicle's ready.

Mary:
Make sure you've got the right equipment.

Mary:
I saw them with handmade crossbows.

Mary:
Let it get a little darker, then send a few drones ahead to the Pioneer living quarters. Confirm the position of every hostage and bandit.

Mary:
We follow behind, and look for a good opportunity to bust in.

Rhine Defense Member:
Then... what about Researcher Silence and that Rhodes Island operator?

Mary:
What are you going for here?

Rhine Defense Member:
I'm not sure which side they're on.

Mary:
Is that how you Rhine Labbers work? You've gotta pick a side first no matter what you're doing?

Rhine Defense Member:
We just want to ensure all problems are resolved.

Rhine Defense Member:
That's what we do in Defense, Officer.

Mary:
And what I do is help people.

Mary:
Listen, I don't care what you guys want to do. My advice is to make sure you don't get in the way of my job either.

Sonny:
So you're saying it's Rhodes Islanders who saved you?

Greyy:
Rhodes Island didn't just save my life in the accident, they gave me the chance to continue my education.

Greyy:
I'm where I am today all because Rhodes Island changed my life.

Sonny:
Hahah... what a nice company.

Sonny:
Any other time and place, I would've thought you were running a recruitment drive.

Greyy:
Mr. Sonny—if you do have an interest, you can absolutely send your CV to Rhodes Island.

Sonny:
......

Sonny:
Me, a Pioneer, and looking like a kidnapper now... handing my CV to a company as fine as you're talking about?

Sonny:
Pretty funny joke there.

Sonny:
Humble yourself all you want, but I can still tell how much potential you got as an engineer.

Sonny:
Not to mention your three ladies in there... They're all Infected, and they still got hired by Rhine Lab? Do you know how tough that is?

Greyy:
Um... yeah, they definitely are outstanding...

Sonny:
No, not just outstanding. They're one in a million. Top of their fields.

Sonny:
You got so many Infected each year, and only the tiniest number of talents ever get 'pardoned.'

Greyy:
But Rhodes Island...

Sonny:
Yeah, Mr. Greyy, you want to tell me, 'Rhodes Island never gives terms that harsh when it saves people.'

Sonny:
Even if I was willing to believe you, believe your special kind of faith in the company that saved your life, believe it was ready to go against its own nature, its self-interest and treat an Infected fair and square.

Sonny:
You still can't tell me you're not lucky to be one of the chosen ones.

Sonny:
And the saps left over, they get round up to sit and wait until they drown in the mud. Their only other chance is to try taking a few steps, face up to bigger danger, and go looking for the tiniest place where just for a moment, they can rest their feet.

Sonny:
Them and me... we're all in the same boat. No soul to save us. Can't even save ourselves.

Elena:
Olivia, do you really think this is going to help?

Silence:
Joyce's brain activity indicators have stabilized somewhat.

Silence:
I've administered some intravenous nervous depressants. That used to be a routine treatment method. The effect isn't especially ideal in this case, but...

Silence:
Could her attack have had some other trigger?

Elena:
Isn't she still in serious danger either way?

Silence:
Yes. As long as we can't treat the cause, she needs a better care environment.

Elena:
That's great... but I'm not even asking about Joyce's condition.

Elena:
You let Greyy and the Pioneer leader go on patrol together.

Silence:
That wasn't my decision. It was Greyy's own idea.

Elena:
You're the captain.

Elena:
I haven't spent as much time on the Rhodes landship as you two have, but I know how the company works, Olivia. I'm not trying to criticize you...

Elena:
But if Greyy runs into trouble, or we're held up treating Joyce, you won't forgive yourself.

Silence:
Do you believe Sonny would more easily trust Greyy, or us?

Elena:
Is there a difference?

Silence:
I recall you were unfortunate enough to catch Oripathy in a testing accident at Rhine headquarters.

Elena:
Yes.

Silence:
Did it cross your mind at the time... that you might never be able to do research again?

Elena:
Of course it did.

Elena:
But the boss—I mean, Ferdinand sent a new contract right out, extending the three years to ten, and giving me a thirty percent raise.

Silence:
You were Employee of the Year.

Elena:
Yeah... not much of a consolation prize, right?

Elena:
I mean, all the time I was getting treated at Rhodes Island, I ended up writing the director three entire conference papers.

Silence:
I understand your perspective; I'm more or less the same.

Silence:
I'm far less purely optimistic than you. I've worried about the future, and following from that, I was thankful to Parvis and Rhine Lab, for a time.

Silence:
But I... I've never doubted my own abilities, nor what they could do for Rhine Lab in return.

Silence:
For us, Oripathy is a challenge to overcome; it's not going to gnaw our entire lives away.

Silence:
And that's why... Greyy can do what we can't.

Greyy:
Mr. Sonny, I'd like to point out, there's a kind of contradiction in what you're saying.

Sonny:
For real?

Greyy:
You say that the Pioneers risk it all in search of the next place to rest their feet...

Greyy:
So how do you know we're not about to come across a way out?

Frontier Team Member:
Sir, the building—the power's back!

Sonny:
What the hell?!

Greyy:
Hm...

Sonny:
Wait, you son of a gun—that's what you were doing the whole time you were talking to me?

Greyy:
Mr. Sonny...

Greyy:
If I hadn't run out into the darkness back then, I wouldn't ever have met the Rhodes Islanders who came before me, carrying the light.

Greyy:
Trust me. Sometimes, taking one more step really does mean something.

Sonny:
Even if... I'm already standing on the brink?

Greyy:
—Even if you've already jumped off.

Greyy:
We've seen you reaching out your hand. You're crying out to us for help.

Greyy:
So we'll do everything we can to catch you.

Greyy:
No matter what you've been through, it's far from time to give up yet.

Elena:
We've got power!

Elena:
Did Greyy... do it?

Ptilopsis:
Hngh...

Silence:
That's a relief. Joyce is showing a reaction to the light.

Elena:
Trust you to be so focused, even now.

Sonny:
Ladies.

Elena:
......

Elena:
Why are you back alone? Where's Greyy?

Sonny:
This is the only place with power right now. He's making for the other quarters.

Elena:
I...

Sonny:
You don't trust me, do you?

Elena:
Stay back!

Silence:
Elena?

Elena:
Olivia, you said he wouldn't trust us, but...

Elena:
I have even less grounds to trust him.

Elena:
He tricked me and Joyce into coming here, and I've kept quiet on this the whole time... I saw more of them surrounding the labs.

Elena:
All of those Pioneers are armed!

Sonny:
It's not what you think...

Elena:
What do I think, huh? You said you didn't want to do anyone dirty! You mean you forgot how Dorothy's been treating you all?!

Elena:
You're going to hurt her for your own selfish ends!

Sonny:
Is that...? Did you pull an alarm?

Elena:
I've been planning to for a long time. I'm sure the police and my Defense colleagues are already on the way. They won't need any drones to pin our position now.

Elena:
Much thanks to Greyy for this.

Sonny:
So that's why he got the power back on...

Elena:
Don't project your own gloomy mind on him.

Elena:
Greyy really does want to help you, just like Dorothy and Joyce do.

Elena:
Out of respect for them, I'll consider letting you off the hook.

Elena:
Sir, whatever plans you had before, give them up before it's too late.

Mary:
Are the drones out?

Rhine Defense Member:
Not yet. Our people are waiting for your order.

Mary:
Then tell me... what the hell is that thing shining above the site?!

Greyy:
So close. It'll all be good soon.

Frontier Team Member:
That's some... goddamned beautiful light.

Greyy:
Is it? Thank you...

Frontier Team Member:
Hahah... Got me feeling thawed out some, even, working with you here.

Frontier Team Member:
Just that bit left in front now, right? We'll show those megacorpers! Cut whatever you want to us, we won't take it sitting down, not while we've still got our own two hands to get things done!

Greyy:
Wait, something's wrong...

Greyy:
Hold on a second!

Frontier Team Member:
What is it?

Greyy:
D—Don't go any further! That light isn't my Arts!

Sonny:
Doc Silence.

Silence:
Hm...

Sonny:
I'd like to ask just one more time. Are you really willing to trust a Pioneer?

Silence:
I'm a doctor, and a researcher.

Silence:
I'm like my colleagues—

Elena:
......

Silence:
In that I trust the truth.

Elena:
What's the deal outside?

Elena:
What are they all running for? Did you—

Sonny:
No, not on my orders.

Frontier Team Member:
Get away from me, you bastard—!

Sonny:
Shit!

Elena:
The police are probably here to rescue us.

Sonny:
No, stay in here!

Elena:
What the hell is wrong with you now—

Sonny:
My guess is, that thing's come again...

Elena:
What thing?

Sonny:
Well, the... truth, I wanted to tell you about.

Silence:
Elena, keep away from the door!

Frontier Team Member:
Sir—s—sir...

Frontier Team Member:
Got...ta watch... out...

Sonny:
......

Silence:
Has he been hurt? Or is he... having an attack?

Sonny:
Stay away from him.

Silence:
Your teammate is clearly in need of assistance!

Sonny:
Watch what's behind him—

An irregularly shaped object hangs in the air.

Its surface is exceptionally glossy, issuing gentle silver rays all about, and it hovers faintly up and down at this moment, as if following some sort of breathing pattern.

After rising up behind the Pioneer, about three seconds pass where it hangs in the air.

Then immediately, it slowly rotates its own body, as if curiously assessing every human at the scene.

Silence:
This... It's...

Sonny:
Run!!!
