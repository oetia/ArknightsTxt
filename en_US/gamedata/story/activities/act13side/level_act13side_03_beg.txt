Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman McKee:
I've been hearing you reported Olmer Ingra to the National Council?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
True...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
If a fatality during the Major isn't enough to warrant punishment, then what does the law even...

Spokesman McKee:
We're all well aware of how the National Council operates, Malkiewicz, my man. You had to deal plenty enough with them in your entrepreneurial life, didn't you?

Spokesman McKee:
Don't spend too long at a loss. You have a trip to the Infected intake-treatment zone in a short while. You need to make the Knights Association and a few healthcare firms see eye to eye.

Spokesman McKee:
Think on the bright side. This work is saving lives in and of itself, isn't it?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman McKee:
Don't get too worn out. You'll grind yourself to dust at this rate. If you'll excuse me, I'm off to a meeting.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
...*Sigh*.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
...!

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Hello, Malkiewicz speaking...

A Voice from the Phone:
Spokesman Malkiewicz, hope you're having a good day.

A Voice from the Phone:
I'm a deputy justice of the National Council. Your suit has reached us, Spokesman.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Ah...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
How do you plan to proceed?

A Voice from the Phone:
It is the obligation of a spokesperson to report those knights out of line with the regulations of the General Chamber. As such, we will prioritize our considerations your... complaints against Brassrust Knight.

A Voice from the Phone:
However, matters with said Knight Olmer Ingra are somewhat complex.

A Voice from the Phone:
You should be aware it was not long ago that Ingra's application for bail was given fresh approval by the National Council; to try him again now could have adverse implications for the National Council's authority.

A Voice from the Phone:
We consider, of course... that the spokesperson's demand equates to the Board of Directors' demand. Such as is the only interpretation we can make, we would not refuse you.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Which is why we're having this call. I understand. What are the National Council's conditions?

A Voice from the Phone:
Oh... conditions? Please, not in those terms. I hope you understand this to be a perfunctory business call.

A Voice from the Phone:
Mr. Czarny suffered banishment external to proceedings; that was beyond many expectations. Even we do not consider Mr. Czarny's mistake to be so irredeemable.

A Voice from the Phone:
But regardless, the past is the past. Czarny has left the Grand Knight Territory and been deprived of his place as a spokesman.

A Voice from the Phone:
But because of the abruptness of this banishment, we have not been able to appropriately—handle the aftermath, with regards to all parties.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
...You...

A Voice from the Phone:
The Rose Paper Union is a patron of Brassrust. That is Mr. Czarny's personal handiwork.

A Voice from the Phone:
He is privy to too much... Mr. Malkiewicz, do you understand?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I... don't understand...

A Voice from the Phone:
If you can ensure Mr. Czarny never again will be an issue for us... then we will be sure to punish Brassrust with the full force of the law.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
So... you mean... I should...

A Voice from the Phone:
I understand the Major has your hands full. It need not be straight away. You need only agree that you will have Mr. Czarny disappear in a respectable manner, and I will leave at once to make the arrangements.

A Voice from the Phone:
Of course, in the wake of Mr. Czarny's disappearance, we may also come to establish... a deep bond of reliance.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't give you an answer right now.

A Voice from the Phone:
That is very regrettable. We hope you will make your mind up as soon as possible; Sir Brassrust Knight's suspension is by no standards a long one.

A Voice from the Phone:
We welcome your call any time, Mr. Malkiewicz. May you have a wonderful day.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
...Ah!

A Person at the Door:
Mr. Malkiewicz? Are you there?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
C-Come in...

Greatmouth Mob:
Uh... Mr. Malkiewicz... I'm sorry to disturb you.

Greatmouth Mob:
To tell the truth, uh, I haven't been sleeping well lately. I got the notice I'd be MCing a whole bunch of the Major's events, and I'm honored... but...

Greatmouth Mob:
Can I ask if I've been getting any complaints recently? I heard some people aren't happy with how I perform now, saying they liked the old style better.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I think we'll be hard-pressed to get a direct answer from the Board. Sorry, Mob. Just proceed with caution.

Greatmouth Mob:
*Sigh*... There's a huge bonus on the line once I'm done commentating for the Major, right?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
So long as you don't slip up.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Say... what kind of place is your hometown? The...

Greatmouth Mob:
The City of Artisans?

Greatmouth Mob:
Ha, who's asking these days. It's a little old place... used to be pretty famous, but now it's just a tired, backwards city.

Greatmouth Mob:
That's why I came to the Grand Knight Territory. Needed another way to make my life happen. You get me, right?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'll help you as much as I can to get your word out, Mr. Mob. You've worked very hard...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
...They won't trouble you... they wouldn't.

Gravel:
...Doctor.

Gravel:
What are you looking at?

Gravel:
Ah... the Infected shelter and treatment. It's an initiative they only started in the last few years. It's got a long way to go.

Gravel:
But even for you, Doctor, I say you're better off not prying too deeply~

Gravel:
Infected knights have been a thorn in the side of all the great nobles. If Rhodes Island wants a premier business contract, then it's important to know when to bite your tongue.

Gravel:
The K.G.C.C... Their pamphlets really do dampen your day.

Gravel:
If you're finding it dull, Doctor, I could accompany you on a strollabout. So long as I'm with you, even a little trip to the commercial districts won't fall out of line.

Gravel:
Of course... if you're more inclined to stay in here, I won't meddle.

Gravel:
The Major... ahh.

Gravel:
Come to think of it, the Rhodes Islanders all seem tied up with the Radiant Knight.

Gravel:
Are you worried about her? Heh-heh... I'm jealous...

Gravel:
Competition knights are always in the public eye, but you... care for her as a 'companion,' don't you?

Gravel:
It's a novel feeling, the Radiant Knight somewhere other than Kazimierz—how is a knight regarded, I wonder, in the world beyond her country?

Gravel:
By the way, Doctor.

Gravel:
You have a meeting in a bit, with a spokesman from the General Chamber of Commerce.

Gravel:
Spokespeople for the K.G.C.C. are the cream of the crop from all walks of life, chosen by the board, each with their own duty, handling all sorts of affairs large and small for the Major.

Gravel:
They're not the highest tier of authority, but they're channels to it. Seeing how a Chamber mouthpiece has asked to meet you by name, I'd like you to be a little careful.

Gravel:
Come what may, I will be responsible for your safety throughout your stay in Kazimierz. I'll be as close as your shadow.

Gravel:
Uh oh, what's that look on your face for now? Do you still not trust me? I can't help but feel a little hurt...

Gravel:
But relax. So long as I'm by your side... you'll be perfectly safe.

Gravel:
If you have doubts about my loyalty... if I do anything that worries you, then Rhodes Island can punish me however you want...

Gravel:
...any way you want.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Excuse me... is this the room where {@nickname} from Rhodes Island is staying?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Ah, Madam Knight... who might you be?

Gravel:
Fourth-order knight 'Gravel,' serving as a security consultant for the Doctor and other Rhodes Islanders, for as long as they stay in Kazimierz.

Gravel:
I've been appointed by the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi, Mr. Spokesman. Please don't mind me, and continue with your work.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Take a seat, {@nickname}, and as for you, er... Miss Gravel, if your post allows for it, by all means relax as well.

Gravel:
I'd rather stand and keep a nice, firm grip on the situation.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
...Okay.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You're here representing Rhodes Island?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Nice to meet you.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Er... haha, I guess you're not exactly the sociable type. But that won't at all spoil my... respect for you.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Erm? Maybe... I just heard the company's representative was staying nearby.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You're joking, right? You must be {@nickname}... haha, you've got a sense of humor.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Ahem.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm Spokesman Malkiewicz of the General Chamber of Commerce... Just Malkiewicz is fine.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I've been over my information about Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals. I don't have any relevant background in it, but keeping up the fight against Oripathy... it can't be easy.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
We're very much thankful for the contributions you're making to the Kazimierz Major Project. Have you looked over the terms yet?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Rhodes Island will be acting as a collaborating firm, standing as a unit of the 'medical group,' forming the 'Kazimierz Alliance Medical Organization for the Treatment of Infected.'

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The Organization is under direct purview of the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi... of course, the Knights Association and our own people will make every effort to cooperate with your work as well.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
That's right... In the Grand Knight Territory, you can't avoid dealing with multiple fronts of power. I believe you'll get used to it.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
If you have any questions at all, please feel free to speak up. It's my duty to give answers to our foreign guests, Doctor.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Ah... you seem to have misunderstood. My position is 'spokesman,' but summarily, I represent the 'General Chamber of Commerce' itself.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The General Chamber is the organizer of the Kazimierz Major, as well as an indispensable trade group to Kazimierz.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Actually, though the medical group is nominally the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi's purview, all funding and movement of supplies is within the Chamber's control.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Therefore, we must value the K.G.C.C.'s intents.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Er... perhaps... I'm not sure.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
But this project is solely aimed to serve Infected knights lawfully registered with the Knights Association, knight trainees, and candidates.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
If we had... for example, an unlucky civilian infected in a workplace injury...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Though they wouldn't be covered by the remit, if they could afford it, they would also be eligible to apply for treatment and shelter.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
...If they could afford it.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Me? Haha... you're asking me?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
If I'm completely honest, Infected are far from a part of my life... ah, don't misunderstand me...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
All I mean is that fighting to keep a hold of yourself in a hectic city, scrambling about to live and work... that's an everyday state of affairs for the vast majority.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I know little to nothing about the other countries across our world, but... protecting a group of sick discriminated against for their illness—that can't be a bad thing, can it?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
By all rights, I shouldn't be discussing this with you, but... ahem.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The Infected knight system was structured by the Adeptus and the K.G.C.C.'s Managing Director in concert, fresh in the wake of the Blood Knight's win.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Oh, of course, its premise and scope revolves around 'competition knights.' The lady over there isn't accounted for; the army has their own regulations for handling Infected.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Infected have a special format to go through—it's an additional step we usually call the 'Wipe Out Qualifier,' to prove their ability to, well, be knights.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
If there do happen to be promising athletes among the Infected, then the General Chamber of Commerce doesn't mind cleaning up their identities for them.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Have... have you seen the papers recently? Even now, quite a few are still opposed to this whole thing.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
But at least the Infected don't need to die in misery. In my mind, that's already a big improvement.

Gravel:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Regarding all of you at Rhodes Island... the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi considers you to be an agency with ample experience in dealing with the Infected.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
This is why we'd like you to take charge of physical examinations on the 'Infected knights,' and formulate treatment plans over the Major.

Gravel:
Treatment plans, huh?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Scale? The Infected knights total less than 7% of all competing. Though that's only the count of Infected knights legally registered with the Knights Association.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
If you count everyone, the knight candidates, trainees, and the Infected who were forced to give their nobility under a different identity...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
It's a number worth worrying about. And that's another reason why we're here, discussing this.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You can guess how many Kazimierzians are prejudiced against the Infected.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'll be open with you; the original intent of the Alliance Medical Organization was to appease the populace, by way of systematically treating and administering the Infected knights.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
My wording might've struck you as distasteful, but they're ill after all... and we can't ignore that objective, er, discrepancy. Sorry to put it that way.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Of course, if there's anything at all we can help with, you need only ask.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
At the least... I hope every good knight—can go out with a happy ending.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Er, sorry, I have some business to attend to. If I get the chance, I'd be happy to have dinner with you.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
But, er, what part of it did you want to know about?

Margaret:
Sorry I'm late.

Zofia:
Margaret!

Zofia:
What happened? What was all the talk of you getting carried off by the Candle Knight?!

Zofia:
What did that woman tell you? Did she threaten you? Was the General Chamber of Commerce—

Margaret:
Calm down, Zofia.

Margaret:
We were just dodging reporters, that's all.

Zofia:
Really?

Old Knight:
The Candle Knight Droste, eh? Always been an enigma, she has...

Old Craftsman:
But she's probably in the top three knights of Kazimierz, based on popularity alone. The turnover on her birthday each year'd be enough to build a whole fort.

Margaret:
What sort of knight is she?

Zofia:
Why are you so like Maria? Listen, you need to pay a little more attention to the rivals around you.

Margaret:
You're here for me, aren't you?

Zofia:
Sweet-talking me won't get you anywhere.

Zofia:
She's an astronomical rising star. People even call her 'the second Black Knight.'

Zofia:
She comes from Leithanien, and has a terrifying talent for Arts, an aristocratic upbringing, fine looks, and meteoric fame for her accomplishments.

Zofia:
With all that plus her opaque background adding to the scent of mystery around her, practically overnight, the Candle Knight became one of Kazimierz's household names and a Grand Knight.

Zofia:
The media is still digging into how she leads her private life...

Margaret:
But she's by no means just for show.

Margaret:
She's very young, and very fierce.

Margaret:
I met plenty of supremely talented Casters during my roaming days. Victorians, Leithanians, and... Infected.

Margaret:
Even the most outstanding Caster in the world would find it hard to challenge the qualities she exudes. She may not be a soldier, but I won't underestimate her.

Zofia:
The Black Knight's a very unusual case of Leithanian. She was no good at even the slightest bit of Arts. It's as though she was born to be martial.

Zofia:
That age has come and gone, but I don't think anyone could forget the sheer impression she left, brandishing her massive armaments about.

Zofia:
And the Candle Knight, on the flip end of the spectrum, she's practically a 'model' Leithanian knight.

Zofia:
We don't know what the core of her Arts is, exactly, but the word 'Candle' is absolutely reflective of her equipment's form and her fighting style.

Zofia:
Margaret... is she your next opponent?

Margaret:
In two days. It'll be a bitter fight, and we don't have long to prepare... Where's Maria?

Zofia:
She's at home resting... Are...

Zofia:
Are you smiling?

Margaret:
Hm? Am I?

Spokesman McKee:
...I predicted you would refuse, Miss Droste.

Spokesman McKee:
But the General Chamber wants no more of the Radiant Knight winning left and right like this. We must ensure, at least, that she falls to the loser's bracket.

The Candle Knight:
Strange... Wouldn't it have been easier if you didn't give amnesty to the Radiant Knight to begin with?

Spokesman McKee:
Well... That's...

The Candle Knight:
'The General Chamber of Commerce is never fastened as one.'

Spokesman McKee:
Please! You... must not say anything of the sort, not where you might be heard.

Spokesman McKee:
The Board of Directors is sure to have internal disputes, there's no doubt of that, but if a knight like you were to express such opinions, I worry it'd impact your status.

The Candle Knight:
My apologies... you must have it just as hard, McKee.

Spokesman McKee:
Ah... yes, thank you for your concern...

Spokesman McKee:
In short, I'll be working to mediate for you, even if you aren't willing to use any 'special tricks' against the Radiant Knight.

Spokesman McKee:
But I'd like for you to understand: though you've refused the Board of Directors's proposal, they will adopt other methods. The situation may, perhaps, evolve towards some extreme...

The Candle Knight:
The Armorless Union, you mean.

The Candle Knight:
If possible, I'd like for you to prevent such circumstances from taking hold.

Spokesman McKee:
Miss Droste... *sigh* That's far beyond me to promise.

The Candle Knight:
Heh... come to speak of it, is the Board of Directors so untrusting in my power? As a knight, that really does give me mixed feelings.

Spokesman McKee:
No, that's absolutely not the case, I assure you.

Spokesman McKee:
The Grand Knights at the forefront of the Major all, without a doubt, have the power to rival the apex knights of any country.

Spokesman McKee:
But opposingly, once you step into this domain, once you near the so-called 'limit,' the gaps shrink in size.

The Candle Knight:
The uncertain elements will only grow... isn't that so?

Spokesman McKee:
Yes?

The Candle Knight:
I have no intent of putting you in a predicament. I know how the Board of Directors thinks.

The Candle Knight:
You can go now. I'll look into this... Radiant Knight.

Spokesman McKee:
Good. I'll leave the competition tapes and personal files you need here, then.

Spokesman McKee:
The Radiant Knight seems to have changed vastly since her banishment, I need to warn you of that.

The Candle Knight:
Yes... hence why I wanted to meet her.

The Candle Knight:
Margaret Nearl... Margaret Nearl... hm.

The Candle Knight:
Despises the knight tournament industry, granddaughter of a war hero. The Nearl family's pegasus, yet a high-profile champion of the Major too...

The Candle Knight:
Said to be noble, yet she gives off the air of a campaign knight. Has she seen war and death for herself...?

The Candle Knight:
No, she must have.

The Candle Knight:
Then has she transcended death before? Has she truly dreamed of casting off the fetters and chains?

The Candle Knight:
Or has she already stridden over a whole new boundary?

The Candle Knight:
Heheh, Margaret. How much she seems like... a true knight.
