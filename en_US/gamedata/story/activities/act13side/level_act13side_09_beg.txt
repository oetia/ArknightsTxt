Gravel:
Good news, Doctor.

Gravel:
The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi has approved Rhodes Island's applications. 'It's necessary for our valued partners to visit the city.'

Gravel:
If none of these things happened in the first place, you would've been able to enjoy the Grand Knight Territory more freely.

Amiya:
Doctor, were you looking for me?

Hibiscus:
Oh, Gravel! I still have some healthy food leftovers. Want to take them with you?

Gravel:
......

Nightingale:
Good day, Gravel, Doctor.

Greatmouth Mob:
Wh-What a battle! I can hardly believe my eyes!

Greatmouth Mob:
Actually, I should be talking our unknown Nightzmora! Can you believe this is his first Major appearance, and he's holding his own against a champion?!

Greatmouth Mob:
The clash of blood-red armor on the field tonight will eclipse the moon!

Greatmouth Mob:
The audience is definitely feeling it too! Tola, 'Scourge of the Prairie,' Nightmare Knight! His crazed determination is addictive and intoxicating!

Greatmouth Mob:
Nightmare Knight's been surging in the polls since his duel with the Radiant Knight! Will he add another page to this story?! A rise to grand knighthood?!

Greatmouth Mob:
By the way, Ancients Entertainment is holding a 'Knightly Title Trivia Game!' Guess the knightly titles and win fabulous prizes!

The Blood Knight:
Where'd your bravado go, Nightzmora?

Nightmare Knight:
Ngh...

Nightmare Knight:
Minoan, in the times when my ancestors flayed the land, your heroes had all become naught but words on the lips of poets.

The Blood Knight:
You waste your breath.

The Blood Knight:
Where's your Khagan now? What happened to those proud kinsmen of yours?

Nightmare Knight:
......

The Blood Knight:
One who lives in a bygone nightmare is a pitiful man indeed.

Nightmare Knight:
Minoan, Infected. What are you fighting for?

The Blood Knight:
Survival.

The Blood Knight:
They made me the hero of the Infected... They enshrined me in the annals of history. But I just wanted to survive.

Nightmare Knight:
The hero of the Infected?

Nightmare Knight:
I see... Do you not also fight for your people?

The Blood Knight:
My people...? No. We don't share the same bloodline, nor were we born in the same place. We are just unfortunate enough to suffer the same disease.

The Blood Knight:
I pitied their plight, so I went to deliver them, to find a way out for them.

Nightmare Knight:
You say they're not your people... But you still want to save them...

Nightmare Knight:
Laughable.

Nightmare Knight:
You are mighty, without a doubt. But, have the prairies of Kazimierz been carved up by the Infected and foreigners?

Nightmare Knight:
The Kazimierzians, the Kuranta... Where are they?!

Nightmare Knight:
Did I cross thousands of miles to the country of knights, only to fight against the Infected, Minoans, and my own kinsmen?!

Nightmare Knight:
––A sick joke!

Hibiscus:
Woaaaahh... S-So, this is Kazimierz's commercial hub?

Gravel:
Strictly speaking, this is just one of hundreds of commercial centers across the Grand Knight Territory.

Gravel:
I recommended this particular one because it's close.

Hibiscus:
But there's way too much junk food everywhere! Just one look around and I count three popcorn stands, two pizzerias, and four burger shops!

Hibiscus:
This is unacceptable!

Amiya:
Haha... Is this because there's a competition venue nearby?

Gravel:
Of course. The arena lies at the heart of every center of commerce.

Gravel:
All businesses revolve around the knights' glorious blood sport. It's the way things are done here.

Nightingale:
......!

Nightingale:
Is this... a Nearl doll?

Hibiscus:
Aww! It's so cute!

Amiya:
Wait a minute, this shop... Is it all dedicated to...

A Shopkeeper:
Yo! Are you folks fans of the Radiant Knight too?

A Shopkeeper:
Then, you've come to the right place! This is a specialty store for everything Radiant Knight! Clay figurines, plush dolls, Nearl family crests – you name it, we've got it!

A Shopkeeper:
By the way, if the Radiant Knight manages to defeat the Wind Knight and advance to the finals, our supplier is considering making exclusive commemorative medals from refined Originium! Want to put in a pre-order?

A Shopkeeper:
I mean, the Radiant Knight's pretty much sure to win! Hahaha!

A Shopkeeper:
Thanks for your patronage!

A Shopkeeper:
Oh, uh... You only have foreign money? Lungmen Dollars? Err, you'll have to go to the bank first.

A Shopkeeper:
Let me do the conversion for you real quick... That should be about 1.3 million LMD?

A Shopkeeper:
A shield? Since when did the Radiant Knight use a shield?

A Shopkeeper:
But we have warhammers, double-bladed swords, and even the latest model of swordspears. Want to take a look?

Greatmouth Mob:
It's hard to tell what's going on! Nightmare Knight's ferocious attack was again repelled by the Blood Knight, and the former champion is slicing through the artificial turf as if it was tofu!

Greatmouth Mob:
It's already been ten minutes, but the tempestuous exchange of blows continues! Who will be the first to show signs of fatigue in this seemingly endless battle?

Greatmouth Mob:
––As I speak, the champion is readying his Arts again! He evades a sweeping strike from his opponent!

Greatmouth Mob:
After all that, are the two sides only feeling each other out?! Neither the champion nor the Nightzmora seems to want to take the initiative and cast the first Arts––

Nightmare Knight:
Minoan, how did you learn to fight like this?

The Blood Knight:
Unfortunately, I had very little combat training before becoming a knight.

The Blood Knight:
It was only after that I learned as I fought.

Nightmare Knight:
...A born warrior.

The Blood Knight:
Young man.

The Blood Knight:
I am not your mentor. But, if it is an opponent you seek, there is one thing I can teach you.

The Blood Knight:
The fear you seek to instill through bluffing means nothing to someone who lives only in the present.

The Blood Knight takes a half-step back.

Fresh blood oozes from his armor, condensing into a stream around him.

A crimson light wraps around his weapon, forging it into a lethal edge of judgment.

The Blood Knight:
Answer me, Nightzmora. In the history you dreamt, in the thousands of years between then and now––

The Blood Knight:
Were the Infected ever given a new lease on life?

Nightmare Knight:
Why you...

The Blood Knight:
You call yourself a Kheshig? Then don't back down now, Nightzmora!

The Blood Knight:
Where is your Khagan now? Bring him to me!

The Radiant Knight:
Where is your Khagan?

Old Knight:
Where is your Khagan?

Thousands of years have passed since the Khagan stepped into history.

You'll only find him in history books, boy.

Kheshigs? They were the Khagan's attendants, the greatest warriors known to this world.

The Khagan conquered many places, but in doing so, did a lot of things that hurt people.

It is in the nature of the Nightzmora to spread fear, and the desire to conquer was practically sustenance for the Khagan.

But, Tola.

You were born into this world, and you will surely find your own––

Nightmare Knight:
...Father, rival, master, ideals.

Nightmare Knight:
Was I actually... looking for these things in this city?

Nightmare Knight:
No! It is time to wake up from my dream.

Nightmare Knight:
This will just be a lingering memory. The path I drew for my Khaganquest was set in stone a long time ago.

The Blood Knight:
......

Nightmare Knight:
......

The Blood Knight:
Done saying your prayers?

Nightmare Knight:
My family is dead. My people are lost.

Nightmare Knight:
––The Khagan is wherever the tip of my blade points.

Nightmare Knight:
I—

Nightmare Knight:
––am my own Khagan!

Nightmare Knight:
Come!

Monique:
Clear weather. No wind. A fine day for shooting.

Monique:
Targets: the two leaders of Rhodes Island - one hooded person of unknown race, and one Cautus.

Monique:
Mood... Very bad. Because every time I try to do my work, someone gets in my way.

Shining:
......

Monique:
Addendum. Extremely bad mood.

Shining:
Do you have a habit of keeping a diary?

Monique:
Who would deliberately write these things down? Might as well send it to the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi Kazimierz and ask for a speedier sentence.

Shining:
By the looks of things, you're the type of person who brings her baggage with her to work.

Monique:
Confessarius, the Radiant Knight, and that Cautus who gives off strange vibes.

Monique:
What the hell is Rhodes Island supposed to be anyway?

Shining:
I never had a chance to ask you before, but... You people...

Shining:
Where did you hear the name 'Confessarius'?

Monique has seen the skills of the Sarkaz before her.

Excellent swordsmanship. Complex, seemingly incomprehensible Originium Arts - perhaps witchcraft. Along with the Radiant Knight, she was able to block a Darksteel arrow.

She had a suspicion at the time, that perhaps... 'blocking arrows' was not the full extent of the Sarkaz's abilities.

But now, she is convinced of one thing.

Monique:
...I can't tell you that.

Shining:
I'm also not so kind-hearted that I can just watch an assassin take aim at the Doctor and Amiya, and then let her walk free.

Shining:
Besides, the last time we met, we didn't get a chance to introduce ourselves properly. A bit rude on both our parts.

Monique:
An aura...?

Monique:
Why are all of the Radiant Knight's buddies so shiny and sparkly? I'm getting tired of that aesthetic.

Monique:
(It's a comforting glow... Almost no hints of aggression... Is this Sarkaz witchcraft?)

Monique:
(No...)

Monique:
(Her expression... Does she lament drawing her sword?)

Shining:
......

Monique:
Not in the mood to chat?

Monique:
Very well then. Let's find out just what you're worth.

Greatmouth Mob:
Wh-What just happened...?

Greatmouth Mob:
Are my eyes playing tricks on me? A black mist is rising from the arena – While that isn't too unusual, do you see something rising from the mist?

Greatmouth Mob:
Is that... a banner? Wait, that's... an entire army?!

The Radiant Knight:
......

The Radiant Knight:
Is that... the product of your obsession?

Nightmare Knight:
—

The Blood Knight:
A shame...

The Blood Knight:
A shame that those knights watching from the stands cannot fathom how I how I feel right now.

The Blood Knight:
The flag flutters, the horn sounds, an army marches... An entire people, an entire history.

The Blood Knight:
But––

The Blood Knight:
––is this the reason you've given up the present, to seek out death like a madman?

Nightmare Knight:
––Hraaaagh!

Greatmouth Mob:
The Nightzmora knight launched an attack! B-But with the thick black mist enveloping the arena, I can't see what's going on!

Greatmouth Mob:
Is that something charging forward inside the mist?! Is this Nightmare Knight's true Arts? The ability to summon his ancestors?!

The Blood Knight:
Ridiculous.

The Blood Knight:
You lack the courage to face your fate.

The Blood Knight brings down his axe. He knows he is not facing an ancient Kheshig army.

A young man who seeks his own annihilation.

A young man who tries to bring back a bygone era.

The jet-black mist drowns the sanguine armor of the Blood Knight.

From the impact, from the pain, it is clear that the summoned entities are not illusions or holograms.

The Blood Knight continues to stand motionless. He is waiting. Waiting for the moment when the real Nightzmora will strike.

Nightmare Knight:
(Ancient language) Sleep now, hero!

The Blood Knight lets out a grunt.

Even Kazimierz's strongest armor wails in this moment.

Blade cleaves through armor, and even the sturdy Blood Knight is almost forced to take a knee.

The Blood Knight:
......

Nightmare Knight:
Damn... Only a flesh wound?

The Blood Knight:
You were able to cut me.

The Blood Knight:
But my blood is now on your weapon.

Nightmare Knight:
(A trap––?!)

The Blood Knight:
Don't feel bad. Your lack of combat experience has always been your weakness.

The Blood Knight:
You are still a far cry from the so-called 'Kheshig.'

Monique:
The sight of you and the Radiant Knight blocking Darksteel's arrow made a deep impression. Even a Silverlance Pegasus would have trouble withstanding Darksteel's punishment.

Monique:
My sources tell me you and the Radiant Knight call yourselves the 'Followers,' an organization that treats the Infected.

Monique:
A 'physician,' huh? Looks like I need to toss that informant of mine into the gloompincer cage.

Shining:
Unfortunately, I'm not fond of fighting.

Monique:
Is that so?

Monique:
I used to be in the Victorian army.

Monique:
Because I was just a commoner without noble blood, I couldn't become an officer. The K.G.C.C. ended up poaching me during a joint military exercise.

Monique:
At that time, my old bosses were still rejoicing over one fewer thorn in their sides.

Shining:
......

Monique:
So, I'm quite confident in my aim.

Monique:
From this distance, take three of my arrows head on, and I'll drop my plans for Rhodes Island. Deal?

Shining:
Why should I trust you?

Monique:
Whether or not you do is up to you. The Armorless Union has no shortage of ways to deal with Rhodes Island.

Monique:
For example, we could've applied some volatile chemicals to those dolls that they're clutching so unsuspectingly right now...

Shining:
......

Monique:
Don't give me that look. Anyone could arrange something like that.

Shining:
Three shots.

Monique:
Three shots.

Monique:
(Exhales) ...

Monique:
Number one.

Monique draws her bowstring. A picture-perfect Victorian form.

Back in her military days, the young Monique could pierce a willow branch at a hundred paces. She was famous for it.

Monique:
......!

Shining:
Didn't draw enough for that one.

The Sarkaz before her didn't even draw her sword.

The unexpected result sends a stifling heat through Monique's chest, the unwanted sensation rushes toward her heart.

Monique:
Number two.

She draws her bow taut a second time.

On a rainy night, Monique once attacked a first-order campaign knight.

The opponent was not some famous hero, but a true veteran of the Ursus-Kazimierz War.

His quick reflexes spared him the arrow from the darkness, and the two ended up locked in combat until they plunged off a cliff.

The forests of Kazimierz were cold and steep in the early spring, and the chase through the dense woods lasted seven days and nights.

At the moment when the pain in her limbs and the ringing in her ears were almost intolerable, she drew her bowstring back and nocked her arrow once more, finding her target as he stopped for water.

Shining:
Her stance changed, as has the look in her eyes.

Shining:
Like a hunter, waiting for an opening.

Monique:
—!

The arrow split in two in midair.

One segment embedded itself into the ground. The other disappeared into a grassy clearing, where it startled a few chattering fowlbeasts.

Shining:
But I have no intention of becoming your prey.

Monique:
Are all Confessarii all as skilled with the sword as you?

Monique:
Or rather, are there a lot of other people at Rhodes Island like you?

Shining:
......

Monique:
(Should we redo Rhodes Island's risk assessment?)

Monique:
To be honest, getting rid of Rhodes Island should be the responsibility of the Board.

Monique:
But soon enough, I won't be acting on their orders.

Shining:
......

Monique:
You don't believe me?

Shining:
No... Actually, that doesn't come as a surprise.

Shining:
Our leader has also foreseen this possibility.

Shining:
So what's the point of you saying this? That this duel is solely a matter of your pride?

Monique:
The point is... You should give this everything you've got, Sarkaz.

Monique:
Last one.

Nightmare Knight:
...Nngh!

The Blood Knight:
It's over.

Greatmouth Mob:
A stunning reversal! In a single heavy blow, the Blood Knight has dissipated the heavy mist lingering in the arena!

Greatmouth Mob:
His momentum sweeps right through Nightmare Knight's illusions!

Greatmouth Mob:
Too bad for you, Nightzmora! You made one miscalculation! In the face of the Blood Knight and his mastery of Blood Arts, you underestimated his skills in a melee!

Margaret:
Was that really an illusion? It seemed like... an entire war.

Nightmare Knight:
Graaaah.... Ahhhhh! Arrrrrrghh!!

Greatmouth Mob:
What?! Even after taking that tremendous blow at point-blank range, Nightmare Knight is still standing?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Unbelievable! Could he be mustering a counterattack–?

The Blood Knight:
––As the Blood Knight, I would like to put in a request to speak with the judges.

The Blood Knight:
Yes, he has lost his senses. Should we continue this, his life will be in danger. Let's call this match.

Greatmouth Mob:
––The judges have reached a verdict! Without a doubt, the first knight to advance to the finals of the Major has been decided!

Greatmouth Mob:
The clash between the Nightzmora and the champion has ended! A battle between fear and terror incarnate! I have the results right here––!!

Greatmouth Mob:
It is my great honor to announce the winner of tonight's round––

Before Mob can finish announcing the winner's name, from behind a conspicuous barrier in the corner of the arena....

A certain Infected knight stands up.

An Infected Knight A:
The Blood Knight!

An Infected Knight B:
The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight!

Margaret:
They're all... Infected?

An Infected Knight:
The Blood Knight has won! Long live the Blood Knight!

A Spectating Infected:
The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight!

A Spectating Infected:
The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight!

The Blood Knight:
......

The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight!

The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight!

The Blood Knight slowly lifts his hand and gestures to the audience.

He then turns his head to look at the Nightzmora who has still not fallen.

As the Blood Knight lifts his eyes above the Nightzmora, his gaze meets that of another knight in the distance.

The Radiant Knight:
......

The Blood Knight:
......

The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight!

Greatmouth Mob:
Umm...

Greatmouth Mob:
(The professional thing would be to not interrupt the audience when they're in an uproar, but most of them seem like they're Infected... so maybe it's fine?)

A Voice on the Television:
The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight!

The Candle Knight:
This is the hero of Kazimierz's Infected, Margaret.

The Candle Knight:
You strive to fulfill a similar role. How will you deal with this overlap?

A Voice on the Television:
The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight!

Ioleta Russell:
This is the Infected... Dikaiopolis.

A Voice on the Television:
The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight!

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
So that's the hero, the Blood Knight. So much fanfare for that name.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Though the Radiant Knight is a paragon of defiance, the one who truly managed to carve out a space for the Infected... is the Blood Knight, Dikaiopolis.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
But... it has been a long time since he bowed his head to us.

Spokesman McKee:
In my capacity as a media man, I deeply appreciate your proposal, Mr. Malkiewicz.

Spokesman McKee:
But as you know, this... public opinion, is just a thin layer of assurance. To make sure things go smoothly, we'll have to prepare to play hardball.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Of course.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I just don't want everyone to end up... with no way back.

An Enthusiastic Spectator:
The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight won!

An Enthusiastic Spectator:
Ahaha! I knew the Blood Knight was invincible! Nobody can take him down!

An Enthusiastic Spectator:
Oh, what's going on over there?

An Enthusiastic Spectator:
The roof over there... is it sunrise?

Monique:
—

Monique:
You—

The Sarkaz slowly closes her eyes, as if refusing to view her Arts.

A brief brilliance lingers on the tip of her sword, like the setting sun.

As if she suddenly remembered something, the Sarkaz quickly changes her pose, bringing the sword into her embrace.

As if this sword never should be unsheathed.

Monique:
......

Monique:
What... did you do just now...

Monique:
Was that Sarkaz witchcraft? No, what I felt just now was...

The breath of life? No. A soul's lifeforce? No.

It was more like a formless illusion, something that could only be touched while in a trance or a drunken stupor.

But there is no doubt that just now, the Sarkaz... was wielding the twilight.

Monique:
......

Monique:
Grr...

Monique:
That technique... You...

Monique:
You could've killed me!

Shining:
I was just taking your three shots, Armorless.

Shining:
Of course, if you go back on your word, I will.

Monique:
You—

The feeling of being caught.

She can't run. She would be chased down... But by what? By that Sarkaz? Or her sword?

Or by the thing she controls... the essence of life?

Monique:
......

Shining:
Do you want to continue?

Monique:
No.

Monique:
Even on the job, we still fulfill our obligations.

Monique:
Pull out. Stop tailing Rhodes Island.

Shining:
Thank you.

Monique:
I have one more, kind of trivial question for you.

Shining:
I'll consider it, out of respect for you keeping your word.

Monique:
For you Sarkaz, is there some kind of significance... to cutting off your horns?

Shining:
It differs from person to person. Some may see their Sarkaz heritage as a curse, and may do that as a way of trying to hide their identity.

Shining:
It might also be a way to channel a certain form of witchcraft, to a facilitate a certain Arts.

Shining:
Or perhaps... it might even be a tradition of some unconventional tribes. The possibilities are many, and there's no way to say for sure.

Monique:
......

Shining:
Why do you ask?

Monique:
...No, no reason.
