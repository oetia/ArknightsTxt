Zofia:
Her very first time entering a knight competition, Viviana Droste earned a title; 'Glimmer' Viviana. Three years later, with her Major debut, she became one of the Grands, taking on the honorific title 'The Candle Knight.'

Zofia:
In terms of talent, she's the youngest any of the ten Grand Knights have ever been. In terms of strength, hers is still growing to this day. She can't be taken lightly.

Zofia:
Margaret, are you listening?

Margaret:
Yes. I'm just reminiscing some.

Maria:
Auntie, is this like how you and Margaret... used to take on the Major?

Zofia:
Well, if you want to talk then... heheh.

Zofia:
A certain someone always vanished after a match ended, either holing up in her room studying deep into her next opponent's traits, or secretly running off to train her swordhand with Młynar...

Zofia:
I still remember us all agreeing to celebrate with a feast the first time Margaret won, and in the end she let it completely slip her mind.

Zofia:
When we found her, she was dragging her battered body, attempting her own Arts in the garden.

Zofia:
I did want to ask right then, aren't you freezing?

Margaret:
It was because my Arts can alleviate pain, too, so...

Zofia:
So ultimately it's not proper treatment, or else what value would modern medicine even have?

Margaret:
Heheh... I won't argue with that.

Margaret:
I know many a doctor that would astonish you. It's thanks to their invaluable techniques that rescuing others is no longer a far-fetched notion.

Zofia:
Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals? Or was it those two Sarkaz women?

Margaret:
Both. They're all in the fight against suffering.

Maria:
Come to mention it, Miss Shining and Miss Nightingale went to link up with friends from Rhodes Island, didn't they?

Maria:
I'm not sure how they're doing right now.

Margaret:
No matter if they're in the Grand Knight Territory, they're still giving all they have to assist the Infected. I believe in them.

Margaret:
But what I myself must do is unrelated to Rhodes Island's will. I can't force this responsibility upon them.

Margaret:
Hence why I separated from Rhodes Island.

Maria:
Margaret... take a little care of yourself too, when you can.

Zofia:
There's something fine for you to say. If you want to talk mess, Maria, you've been SO much worse.

Maria:
...Haha...

Zofia:
Alright—anyhow.

Zofia:
What's the plan of action now? I don't think training would have much meaning to you now, personally speaking.

Zofia:
But this is your first time in years facing a Grand Knight. Should we have a little exercise, get back to peak condition?

Margaret:
If you would, Zofia.

Zofia:
Brilliant.

Zofia:
Maria, you're up.

Maria:
Er, um? I thought I was fine to just sit and watch?

Zofia:
Sit and watch? I didn't ask you to bring your equipment for no reason, did I? Didn't you see what happened last time? Do you want me taking the Radiant Knight alone again?

Maria:
Ungh...

Margaret:
Zofia, if she isn't willing...

Zofia:
And don't you coddle her!

Margaret:
Very well.

Maria:
A—Am I sparring with Margaret? I've never...

Zofia:
When Margaret was competing, you were just a little girl. Though you still are now.

Zofia:
Maria.

Maria:
Yes, yes!

Zofia:
Let's give our Radiant Knight a little taste of how independent knight, Maria Nearl, toppled Left-hand Knight.

Maria:
Okay!

Maria:
Alright, Margaret... let's go!

Margaret:
......

Margaret:
Very well.

Meeting Maria's gaze, the words of a certain someone suddenly pop into the Radiant Knight's mind.

Młynar:
I'm aware, I'm aware... the scheduling for next week's meeting is already in place. Yes. I will not be absent.

Młynar:
I assure you I'll see the work delegated to me through. Yes, I'm very sorry. No... it's nothing to do with the Radiant Knight. I remain an employee of the company. I'll accomplish whatever business is at hand.

Młynar:
It has absolutely nothing to do with my status. Sir, please leave me out of this mockery. They're unrelated matters and nothing else...

Młynar:
Thank you. Alright, I'll see you next week at the meeting.

Młynar:
......

Toland:
Someone's a singleton, huh?

Toland:
Is this what the Radiant Knight and her sister do too? Never come back home?

Młynar:
Toland. I've warned you, don't set foot on my carpet whenever you please.

Młynar:
The Armorless Union's eye is firmly fixed upon you. Are you planning to drag me down alongside?

Toland:
Now that's beyond my wildest dreams. Relax. As long as they don't fold their big slippery kill-men in, how are a bunch of armed lackeys ever gonna track me down?

Toland:
I'm not winning in a fight, this city's their turf. But if they want to catch me, they'll have to show they want it.

Młynar:
Are you asking me to praise your audacity?

Toland:
Now that'd be something else. A high knight praising me, some lowlife? I wouldn't carry that weight, would I?

Młynar:
I am no longer a knight.

Toland:
Not even today, with the Radiant Knight getting her title back?

Młynar:
Shamelessness.

Młynar:
Why are you here?

Toland:
C'mon, I didn't come to the Grand Knight Territory just for you, Mister Knightsir... but in seriousness, if I could talk you into lending a hand to us, that'd be a fine, fine thing.

Młynar:
I regretfully inform you, this matter is already settled.

Toland:
Even though I've given a hundred percent to protecting your little Nearl nieces?

Młynar:
Even then.

Toland:
Alright, fine.

Toland:
Maybe you really have changed. Młynar. I'm just giving you a heads up...

Toland:
I passed by the border of Kawalerielki today. Those districts were originally a city of their own, right?

Toland:
You still remember the sight we saw when we came back to the GKT together, back when we were young?

Toland:
Miles of camps outside the city knocked together by the refugees and the poor, bonfires in the evening lighting up the faces of the homeless.

Toland:
Infected, bandits, farmers, workers, even knight nobility thrown to the beasts. If tragedy was a melting pot, there it melted.

Toland:
The sobbing and the anger all mixing together. Even as people to the side are being robbed and killed, they just shuffle their bodies around and try to give themselves a better sleep.

Młynar:
......

Toland:
Ha... I know you wouldn't forget. I know you... you've just been angry for too long, lost hope.

Młynar:
I won't need you to help me decide.

Toland:
The Armorless Union is cleaning out the Infected's haunt tonight. The coordinates are on this sheet.

Młynar:
And what do the Infected knights... have to do with me?

Toland:
Oh, Kazimierz is loaded with ways to treat the Infected. Even if they drive them to take each other's lives like gladiators, they still beat Ursus by a long shot.

Toland:
—But the workers infected in the building of the city, the farmers infected when they couldn't escape Catastrophe, and the survivors struggling so they can become knights?

Toland:
They'll die like wretches before your eyes. What the Infected will go through will directly impact how public opinion determines the Radiant Knight. And then, in the end, everything you love will be swept into the storm that follows.

Młynar:
You don't need to threaten me.

Młynar:
What about you, then?

Toland:
I'll help out a bit, 'as I feel it.' If it really comes down to it, I might risk my neck a little.

Toland:
Pinus Sylvestris is an important potential partner of ours, and I want to pull them in with us. Ha, sure, they're Infected, but they're big fancy knights, just like you, aren't they?

Toland:
And that's about that... I'll give you a final touch of advice, Młynar.

Toland:
The big picture's coming together. Staying out of it won't get you anywhere, anymore.

Sona:
All present, then?

Plastic Knight:
Since when did you have so many people?

Greynuty:
However many knights have been oppressed, are however many knights here.

Greynuty:
Drop the idea that you're the only one who's suffered and wants to rebel, Szewczyk.

Plastic Knight:
......

An Infected Knight:
'Plastic' Szewczyk. I've got no prejudice against pets of the General Chamber like you, but I can't say how happy I am, still seeing some will to rebel in your eyes.

Justyna:
Everyone still has a trace of it. The unwillingness to drift with the tide.

Iwona:
Hah! Drifting with the tide's one thing, but this swell's gonna beat us dead clear as day in the darkest dump around! And that's sure as hell not their call to make!

Sona:
The plan's very simple.

Sona:
Three years ago, on the day before that Major, the moment the four cities were about to link up, the core city power plant got paralyzed by terrorists.

Sona:
In order to merge smoothly, each district already had its own engines shut off. When the core city's power dropped out of them in that state, every district was forced to switch over to their independent power systems, which included their cities' engines.

Sona:
At that point, in order to stop the districts colliding, the Grand Knight Territory was forced to completely scatter apart.

Justyna:
The Great Kawalerielki Separation.

Sona:
Yep.

Sona:
But this time, while the Major's on, we're going to completely cut the lights in all the Grand Knight Territory's arenas.

An Infected Knight:
I've heard it multiple times and it still sounds crazy. Can we really pull this off all on our own?

An Infected Knight:
If the Grand Knight Territory fell this easy, then Ursus would've razed Kazimierz to the ground ages ago.

Plastic Knight:
Does this tie in with your... 'Sprawiedliwi friends?'

Plastic Knight:
Strange. The Adeptus allowing the Separation to rear its scandalous head again? What are they calculating?

Iwona:
Hah, what, the biggest scandal wasn't getting rode out by the business suits?

Plastic Knight:
What's the specific plan?

Sona:
Tomorrow evening, Greynuty's taking a team to shock-attack the Grand Knight Territory power plant.

Sona:
Ordinarily, it's heavily guarded down there, but on this occasion, the Adeptus are gonna deliberately leave an opening... to give us 'something to exploit.'

An Infected Knight:
If the Adeptus are willing to help us so much, why don't they just do this themselves?

Sona:
Haha, they don't exactly speak in unity. Not just the Adeptus, the law-and-order National Council, the Knights Association, even the General Chamber of Commerce...

Sona:
We've seen our fair shares of the volatile human condition. Since when would they ever be so simple?

Sona:
Justyna, you go with Ashley.

Sona:
After you complete your mission, cover them while they withdraw, then rush for the General Chamber building three kilometers out. Szewczyk'll be there to back you up at the designated spot.

Sona:
As for you, Iwona, you're gonna have to handle the Armorless Union.

Iwona:
Aha, just what I wanted to hear!

Sona:
The Armorless are already watching this place, so we won't get to pull this off so smooth. You've gotta find some way to proactively get them into a fight, Iwona, draw their attention away.

Sona:
Of course, if any 'elites' show up, you've gotta hit the brakes, turn tail, and scram.

Iwona:
Got it.

Greynuty:
The next time we hold a celebration dinner, I don't want your seat empty. I'll have no one to drink with, otherwise.

Iwona:
Relax. As long as you don't mess up and electrocute yourself, I'll keep with you to the bitter end.

Sona:
Finally... with the help of a few conscientious reporters, we've found a passage to infiltrate the General Chamber of Commerce.

Sona:
The entrance to the Chamber building's freight elevator is underground. Usually it's only Messengers and porters that go through there—

Sona:
—Of course, even a freight elevator has its cameras. It won't be as easy as that.

Sona:
But at the time of the last Great Kawalerielki Separation, with the power out, a Messenger trapped in the elevator escaped by himself, then got caught by a reporter for an interview—

Sona:
He got into the elevator well through the air vent, climbed up, all the way to the fourth floor meeting rooms.

Sona:
Our objective's the penthouse computer room. Once we steal the data, I'll find a way to immediately upload it to your terminals, and all of you can get the material—

Greynuty:
—So that this'll work, even if you don't make it out?

Greynuty:
You can't tell me anything of the sort, Sona. I'm disappointed in you. Even if it succeeds, this operation won't mean anything at all.

Justyna:
Not just you.

Justyna:
Assaulting the power facilities. Facing the Armorless Union. Not a single aspect of this is safe.

Szewczyk:
You want 'safety' now? Hmph, if the Armorless really do send assassins for us, it'll be nothing but playing hunter.

Szewczyk:
And moreover, we're certain to be the prey. Anyone who's not prepared for this, I suggest you back out right now. Don't drag us down when the time comes.

An Infected Knight:
We have no way out in the first place, Sir Knight.

An Infected Knight:
We were prepared for this long ago, because we never even needed to prepare.

Sona:
What we genuinely need amounts to two things.

Sona:
The truth of Area 0—the cage for the Infected secretly built by the General Chamber—we need to let the whole world know about it.

Sona:
And the Armorless Union's 'roster.' To put it in perspective, even the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi doesn't know how many are on that list... In the worst-case scenario, it'll all have been a ruse set up by those spymasters in the first place.

Sona:
Even so, as long as we succeed in handing these two things over to the Adeptus, we can get our legal papers back... and we won't ever be anyone else's playthings again.

Sona:
As long as we give the Adeptus a reasonable motive to investigate Area 0 and the Armorless Union, it'll be the best attack they could ever make on the General Chamber of Commerce.

Sona:
Win or lose, this is the moment.

Sona:
Alright! I like those looks in your eyes!

Sona:
Well then... anything weighing on you, Toland Cash?

Sona:
You ought to show your face after eavesdropping for so long, right? Iwona's told us already. We won't pull anything on you.

Szewczyk:
What?

Toland:
It's a bold plan. Infected and knightpeople, pleased to meet you.

Szewczyk:
A bounty hunter? Flametail, you never mentioned an outsider like this taking part in the fight.

Toland:
You can't stand bounty hunters? Very sorry, but I've got my own share of hate for knights—

Szewczyk:
......

Toland:
But I imagine the fancy knights know to take stock of a situation, especially ones like you, giving up your knighthood for your family. Factually admirable, I tell you.

Toland:
So what I think, is that maybe you might need a little help in other ways—no, that's fine if you don't trust me—for example, a blueprint of the K.G.C.C. Tower's internal structure.

Justyna:
Where did you get it?

Toland:
There's more ways than you know, Miss, but human connections work best.

Sona:
If you want to join in on us, fine. But. Hm, just as an interview, I want to hear your reasons.

Toland:
Reasons?

Toland:
Ahh... you can already see the K.G.C.C. building from this angle. It's one you can catch from any dim alley in the Grand Knight Territory.

Toland:
I want to see it crumble. It's that simple.

Sona:
Why?

Toland:
Have you ever been to one of those villages hammered by taxation and Catastrophes?

Toland:
I've been. I see them fight over things. I see them run fugitive. I see them pass on.

Toland:
I've been to many a place.

Sona:
It sounds like you've got plentiful experience.

Iwona:
Hah, don't look at me. I thought he was a decent sight from the beginning, right?

'Justice Knight':
(A beeping noise)

Justyna:
No objection.

Greynuty:
It's your call.

Szewczyk:
......

Sona:
Alright, then. Welcome to the club, Mr. Toland.

Amiya:
Doctor!

Amiya:
Ah... mm, I'm alright. All the Medic Operators have been hard at work too.

Amiya:
The Infected knights... I thought they were a special case in Kazimierz, but they number far more than I imagined.

Amiya:
They even have scarring from beast bites... it's precisely because of this that ordinary hospitals are so hesitant to accept wounded Infected for treatment.

Amiya:
However...

Amiya:
No... I can't shake this feeling that something, somewhere isn't normal.

Amiya:
There's nothing wrong with building an Infected treatment facility in an isolated district, but the people who've accepted treatment, they've all been 'knights'...

Amiya:
If it were just for handling Infected knights, they shouldn't have needed to go to so much trouble.

Amiya:
What I mean is... there might be quite a few Infected knights... but how many people—is this nomadic platform able to contain?

Amiya:
The other sections... the workers won't let us near them, but what are those areas—doing?

Amiya:
Alright!

Amiya:
Don't push yourself too hard, Doctor. The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi's knights might be treating us politely thanks to our ties with Miss Nearl, but this is still Kazimierz's core in the end.

Amiya:
That's right, where's Gravel? Wasn't she staying at your side?

Amiya:
Ah... but given you're the one requesting it...

Amiya:
Doctor, you have to be careful when you're dealing with those businesspeople.

Amiya:
I've been hearing of all sorts of rumors from the knights these past few days...

Amiya:
Ah, that's right, I heard about Nearl's performance! Quite a few of the Infected knights coming for treatment are fans of hers!

Amiya:
I'd known 'The Radiant Knight' held weight in Kazimierz, but never imagined this scale.

Amiya:
I hear Nearl's sister's old enough to fight in the knight competitions, so actually she must be older than me, even... if we get the chance, I'd really like to meet her.

Hibiscus:
Amiya! You're here too, Doctor!

Amiya:
Ah, Hibiscus. Any news?

Hibiscus:
Well... it's a little hard for me to put... um.

Hibiscus:
The knights who came in today were talking about 'demonic treatment,' 'the shady doctor from Kazdel' and the like...

Hibiscus:
We wouldn't... advertise like that, would we? To be honest, it should be 'the health administering maestro from Kazdel' anyway!

Amiya:
I—I'll consult Gravel and the spokesman. How did it end up like this?

Hibiscus:
Oh! But—getting a little famous isn't so bad, either. I've been here a while, and you do get to see the same faces from time to time.

Hibiscus:
With such frequent injuries, it seems like competing as a knight isn't much of an easy job.

Amiya:
......

Hibiscus:
But—I did previously tend to an Infected who was seriously hurt, and I haven't seen him for the past few days. Who knows how his recovery's been going...

Amiya:
Do you mean Mr. Silverlamp Knight?

Hibiscus:
Right-right-right, and after I finished basic treatment, he got hauled off by a Knights Association person... I don't know where he's gone.

Hibiscus:
Ah, I see someone waving at me! I need to head over right away! Amiya, don't forget to ask what's going on with that for me!

Amiya:
These Infected knights look... permanently exhausted, going by their faces.

Amiya:
Some may have won matches, gotten considerable prize money, but still can't muster their spirits at all.

Amiya:
It's not like I've never seen this look before. It's just like fighting to the death has filled their entire lives to the point they could burst, and they can't bear even the slightest hope or optimism.

Amiya:
The Infected knight competitions... are simply treating the Infected as entertainment products.

Amiya:
I'm starting to understand a little, what Nearl is here for.

Amiya:
Ah, come in.

Amiya:
(Doctor, are you always so busy in here?)

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Dr. {@nickname}, about that meeting you mentioned last time—I've gotten it all set up and ready.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Oh? Am I interrupting yours and Miss Amiya's conversation?

Amiya:
It's perfectly fine, Mr. Malkiewicz.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
A few medical corporations collaborating with Rhodes Island are deeply interested in your firm's services and technology. Of course, even with a mind for simple friendship, they'd still love to have dinner with you.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
However... if you'd allow me to warn you. If Miss Amiya is to participate... she is ultimately Infected, and I worry you'll be treated in unneeded ways.

Amiya:
It's alright, I'm already used to it.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
My apologies.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
By the way, Dr. {@nickname}, here's the business magazine you mentioned before... I didn't expect you to take such an interest in Kazimierz's economic situation.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Do you plan to open a subsidiary in Kazimierz? I've heard your firm keeps a 'branch office' in our nation.

Amiya:
—?

Amiya:
(D—Doctor, our branch office shouldn't have been officially communicated to the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi yet, right? Did they already... investigate their way to it?)

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You've made the right choice.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I myself only recently began to understand them, but if you truly want to figure out the 'General Chamber of Commerce,' you won't go wrong starting with the 'commerce' part.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Haha, if you do plan to start a business in the Grand Knight Territory someday, be sure to contact me. I'll find you the best team of lawyers for Rhodes Island.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
To tell the truth, Rhodes Island's technology and corporate culture... do deeply move me.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm not saying it out of politeness. I believe 90% of Kazimierz's citizens would agree the Infected form an issue, but the majority of the time, none of them want to solve it.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Rather than avoiding the problem via violence, there's 'treatment.' Yes, Oripathy is just an illness in the end, isn't it?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
But...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
There was an accident in which an Infected passed away on the field, not long ago.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm not casting judgment on this incident itself. I'm saying the force of public opinion is greater than we can imagine.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm no professional at all, but I think of, and you understand better than me, an Infected dying from overcasting in the arena inviting uncontrollable danger, and how great that danger is—

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
—Despite it being, in my eyes, near-deliberate harassment, an unjust confrontation... the fact of the matter is, the barbs of the masses from far and wide are aimed at the Infected.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I worry whether it might affect our cooperation... my Rhodes Islander friends.

Amiya:
Mr. Malkiewicz.

Amiya:
It's not the first time the Infected have been through something like this, and it won't be the last.

Amiya:
In places beyond Kazimierz, what Infected go through far surpass what you've seen.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
A partner of mine, from before I was a spokesman, was once the Rose Paper Union's Executive Director of Publishing.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I quickly came to recognize 'the terror of gossip,' Miss Amiya, Dr. {@nickname}.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Perhaps opinion as of late will impact your work. I'll do my best to placate the moods of the workers and those receiving treatment.

Amiya:
Thank you very much, Mr. Malkiewicz.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
It's the least I can do.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
It seems I still have a little time today... Dr. {@nickname}, did we have an appointment prior?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
If you're free, do let me tour you around Kazimierz a bit.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Of course, so long as the formalities and credentials are in hand, an Infected such as Miss Amiya is free to act as she wishes.

Amiya:
I—I'll be fine, I still need to check in with all our Medic Operators to—

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Appropriate rest is very important, Miss Amiya. Additionally, the patient who just arrived is the last for today.

Amiya:
Really?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Well, then, we'll meet downstairs in ten minutes.

Roy:
Malkiewicz has gotten real close to Rhodes Island lately. Oof, that's not good.

Monique:
The Board of Directors hasn't classified Rhodes Island as a target... which can only mean Darksteel has a different view of Rhodes Island.

Roy:
The three of them have foresight a mile better than the average suits. How many years have they hung around in Kazimierz?

Monique:
What's the point? They're still just the pawns of the K.G.C.C.

Roy:
Sometimes, foresight means 'forget beating the rules that don't benefit you, you've gotta learn to use them, join them.'

Roy:
Yeah, of course the young bunch and the 'ooh, look at me, look at my glory' knights aren't gonna approve of that argument, but it's everywhere, and if you want the truth of society, there it is.

Monique:
What makes your theory so different from all those corporate employees?

Roy:
The difference is... we're strong enough.

Monique:
Don't see the logic.

Roy:
Haha, let's just get back to business. The Board's already made a decision vis-a-vis the Infected purge order.

Monique:
So soon?

Roy:
I told the people upstairs about the Infected knights' plans to riot, after all.

Roy:
Make them realize in advance. Let them be aware 'the Grand Knight Territory is about to face an Infected attack.'

Roy:
That's the only way we'll get any space made to operate.

Monique:
So, then...

Roy:
We're still tidying a few Infected as appropriate.

Monique:
Hmph, could've saved your breath from the start.

Roy:
We've gotta do what we've gotta do, and if we don't do it with enough smarts, we'll invite our own killers in.

Roy:
There sure aren't any heroes in Kazimierz. Look at the bustling street before us. Who'd waste the energy standing off with this city?

An Aged Knight:
Kazimierz's champions—they still carry the people away in this day and age. *chuckle* Truly wondrous.

Gravel:
......

An Aged Knight:
You want to say... it's because I'm old, don't you?

Gravel:
I would never regard you in that matter.

Gravel:
Your Excellency, these documents are classified by the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi. Will handing them over to Rhodes Island...

An Aged Knight:
I haven't reached senility yet.

Gravel:
That wasn't my meaning.

An Aged Knight:
...Senomy.

Gravel:
Yes.

An Aged Knight:
I hear... you never actually offered your patriarch your true name.

An Aged Knight:
We simply 'have a hold on your name,' haven't yet earned your loyalty...

Gravel:
Your Excellency, Grand Knight, I was sold as a slave into Kazimierz, no more.

Gravel:
I'm deeply honored I could receive the appreciation of the master of the house, but how can someone like me have anything to do with the act of offering a true name?

An Aged Knight:
...I see.

An Aged Knight:
You've been in contact with Rhodes Island for a time, now. How's it been?

Gravel:
I believe myself to have already earned a... portion of Rhodes Island's trust.

An Aged Knight:
That's not what I mind at all, Senomy. What I mind is, has Rhodes Island won your trust?

Gravel:
...I...

An Aged Knight:
Campaign knights are servicemen. You're abiding strictly to your duties, fighting bravely for Kazimierz.

An Aged Knight:
You're still so young. Why constrain your own mind?

An Aged Knight:
All we can give the young is the kindling. It's up to you to light the fire.

Gravel:
......

An Aged Knight:
You don't like Rhodes Island?

Gravel:
No... it's just...

Gravel:
If we suppose providing care to the Infected like that is 'justice,' then—what Kazimierz, the Adeptus have been doing for so long—how are we meant to we regard that?

An Aged Knight:
Go and find out yourself. You've still got a long, long road ahead.

An Aged Knight:
The Armorless Union's begun to move. I assume, before the Major hits fever pitch, they want to eliminate the Infected threat.

Gravel:
—Do they really plan to hold a massacre inside the city?

An Aged Knight:
They have cause to. The Infected are indeed planning an attack on the General Chamber's tower. That's not an easy thing to handle.

Gravel:
......

An Aged Knight:
Margaret Nearl—she resembles her grandfather quite a bit.

Gravel:
She's very unlikely to stay out of this.

An Aged Knight:
She's also an exceptional case. Whether the Infected, or the Armorless, they hide outside of the rules drawn up by themselves, and so, suffer the cruelest struggles.

An Aged Knight:
The Radiant Knight... has managed to pierce into this barrier. Pierce into the den of horror that calls itself the knight competitions.

An Aged Knight:
The Nearls wouldn't raise an uneducated knight. By all rights, she should know she's doing no better than bailing water with a glass.

An Aged Knight:
And so... the Adeptus decided to grant her one chance. One chance to humiliate the business suits, one chance to let the knights prove themselves.

An Aged Knight:
They are going to give every ounce to support the Radiant Knight's championship bid.

Greatmouth Mob:
Welcome! Welcome, one and all! Welcome to the Kazimierz National Arena, and welcome to the site of the Major today!

Greatmouth Mob:
I'm your old buddy Greatmouth Mob, honored to host this match you've all been waiting for!

Greatmouth Mob:
Ooh, I've never seen passion swell as high as this—I've gotta tell you all some juicy data. The match hasn't even started, and the number of people watching has already cemented itself as this Major's highest yet!

Greatmouth Mob:
And at the same time! Over the match, we'll be drawing lots for ten lucky people here in the audience! These ten winners are going to get their hands on an assigned tie-in souvenir each!

Greatmouth Mob:
No time to waste, ready your greatest rounds of applause! Out of the legends of the ancient family comes history's youngest champion! Give a warm welcome—to—THE RADIANT KNIGHT! MAAAARGAREEEEEET NEAAAAAAARL!!

Margaret:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
The Radiant Knight Margaret Nearl, returning to the field with a celestial beauty! In just a few short weeks, she's seized qualification to join in on the Major—

Greatmouth Mob:
And it doesn't end there! Today will see this Major's first clash of Grand Knight on Grand Knight! With the honor of 'the T, the H and the E' on their titles, that's all you need to hear to know what these knights are about!

Greatmouth Mob:
Margaret Nearl, Nearl the Radiant Knight! Today, she faces her opponent, the light of elegance from Leithanien!

Greatmouth Mob:
She's been nominated for Most Popular Knight over and over, eighteen individual honors to her name—

Greatmouth Mob:
And if that wasn't enough, her first ever competition, she beat Frost Skull Knight to become the greatest of dark horses! She was runner-up in the last Major's duels! Not to mention her popularity, an utterly uncontested number two in the nation!

A Popcorn-Clutching Knight:
Dark horse? What's dark horse mean? Dark? Dark Knight? The Black Knight?

An Audience Knight:
It just means someone really strong!

Greatmouth Mob:
Her name—ooh, the red-hot crowd is already beginning to chant her name—welcome, THE CANDLE KNIGHT! VIVIAAANAAAAA DROOOOOOSTE!

Candle Knight:
Good evening, Radiant Knight.

Margaret:
Good evening.

The cacophony of voices seems to gradually abate, and in that moment, the two knights nod at each other.

The Candle Knight slowly lifts her hand.

Light and heat, weaving and twining in response to her title.

Candle Knight:
Radiant Knight, are you proud of who you are?

Margaret:
Of course.

Candle Knight:
As a knight? Or as an Infected?

Margaret:
As Margaret Nearl.

Candle Knight:
Hm... a common answer.

Candle Knight:
Were you aware? Truthfully, I was the bastard daughter of a Leithanian noble.

Margaret:
Oh...

Candle Knight:
There at the top of that spire, I couldn't even hear the human clamor of the city down below.

Candle Knight:
I couldn't hear the peddlers market their wares, nor the cars roll across the surface. Every night, the darkness enveloped me, from each and every direction.

Candle Knight:
However, my mother... would bring me, in secret, wax candles.

Margaret:
Wax... candles?

Candle Knight:
Electric lights tend to be easy to spot, don't they? And that noble household always kept so many ornamental candles around, no one would notice if a few went missing.

Candle Knight:
By the candlelight, I would read. Poems, novels, prose from all nations. They were full of magic.

Candle Knight:
In those days, I read a fair share of books.

Candle Knight:
Books, depicting... knights.

Margaret:
...A knight novel?

Candle Knight:
A fabricated romance, only meant to stir people's imaginations, correct?

Candle Knight:
Radiant Knight, since becoming a knight, what is it you've wanted to do?

Candle Knight:
And what should a knight do?

Greatmouth Mob:
The two knights seem to be conversing in their pre-match moments! The atmosphere's so friendly, anyone would hate to shatter it!

Greatmouth Mob:
But in the end, a match is a match! Knights, to your positions please!

Candle Knight:
That was the identity I came to Kazimierz with, practically 'banished' to this nation. Simply so I could live on, I chose to become a knight.

Candle Knight:
To be frank, when I realized that winning matches, earning popularity, was all it took to become 'a knight,' I was disappointed.

Candle Knight:
And in these years, I've never felt much of anything genuine. As if my days making a living in Kazimierz—aren't even as rich as my time hidden in the spire.

Candle Knight:
But you're different.

Candle Knight:
When I came to Kazimierz, the Radiant Knight had already been banished. But as a knight, I'd always hear all kinds of anecdotes about you.

Candle Knight:
You do invite curiosity. If you disdain the knight competitions of now, what goal do you pursue by participating? Is it simply to take this championship, prove something?

Margaret:
Back then, at the time, that was indeed my belief.

Margaret:
If everyone's gazes had diverted from glory, I would go to where they focused most, and tell them all, the knights still remain.

Candle Knight:
At the time?

Margaret:
After I left Kazimierz, I traveled to many places. By no means was I always free from bewilderment—but by the end, I'd chosen my own justice, my own faith.

Candle Knight:
To rescue the Infected?

Margaret:
Yes, but not that alone.

Candle Knight:
So this is your definition of a knight?

Margaret:
If you demand an answer... I once told my sister as much, and to this day, I've still never amended this notion.

Margaret:
'To be a knight is to be the noble light that illuminates the land.'

Bald Marcin:
The Candle Knight and the Radiant Knight, then.

Old Craftsman:
Now there's a match that'll light up every corner. Don't you think, V?

Old Knight:
......

Old Craftsman:
Hey, old bones. Why've you been so out of sorts lately? What's wrong? Did that Nightzmora end up being your long-lost lovechild or what have you?

Old Knight:
Spadaj, what the hell nonsense are you talking?!

Zofia:
Hold on, Maria's not here?

Bald Marcin:
She wouldn't miss her sister's match for the world. Should be right on her way.

Zofia:
......

Zofia:
I'll go and look for her.

Candle Knight:
Illuminate... the land.

Candle Knight:
Not all people can illuminate the land, Radiant Knight. Most are but tiny candle-flames, barely enough to light the way on their own lives.

Candle Knight:
The storm rocks us. In this age, a candle-flame is indistinct, the people have lost their selves, and what frightens me, is they aren't even conscious of it.

Candle Knight:
Knowing this full well, why must you still—

Margaret:
Are you doubting yourself? Viviana?

Candle Knight:
You call me by my name.

Margaret:
That may be who you really are, the Candle Knight is no more than a title upon you.

Margaret:
People's fates are not decided by their births, Viviana. In my view, you are an outstanding knight.

Candle Knight:
...Heheh.

Candle Knight:
(Leithanian) If your faith truly is as unshakeable as the sun, allow such a meager candle-flame as myself...

Candle Knight:
(Leithanian) To try and wrest a moment of your rays.
