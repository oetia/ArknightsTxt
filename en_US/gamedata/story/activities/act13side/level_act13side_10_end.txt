Ioleta Russell:
...'Fear neither hardship nor darkness.'

Ioleta Russell:
These excellent saplings... must take root and grow in this poisonous land.

Ioleta Russell:
Perhaps we made the wrong decision after all, Nearl...

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Grandmaster...

Ioleta Russell:
The General Chamber was unable to figure out our objective.

Ioleta Russell:
Naturally... They must've assumed that we came here to topple them, opportunistically, to consolidate the power of the Adeptus.

Ioleta Russell:
And of course, they'd be correct. The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi has taken over the supervision of Area 0, and the General Chamber must be made to pay.

Ioleta Russell:
But the businessmen will never understand... just how far we're willing to go for the sake of that girl, Margaret.

Ioleta Russell:
'Fear neither hardship nor darkness.' That has long been the motto of the Nearl family.

Ioleta Russell:
But these words have also been inscribed on the swords, spears, and shields of the nearly thirty members of the Silverlance Pegasus Knightclub.

Ioleta Russell:
During that war, in the midst of that hopeless battle, mired in that pitch-black swamp, Kirill Nearl vowed to save every last besieged knight.

Ioleta Russell:
They were without supplies, their communications cut off. The combined army's artillery division and tactical unit were searching for them.

Ioleta Russell:
Nearl only convinced seven knights to take part in the rescue operation. Before they set off, each of them engraved those words on their shields: 'Fear neither hardship nor darkness.'

Ioleta Russell:
Seven knights set out, but forty-one returned.

Ioleta Russell:
But, of the original seven knights, only Kirill and I remained.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
But the two of you saved over thirty comrades.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
And also... brought back everyone's shields.

Ioleta Russell:
'Fear neither hardship nor darkness.' After that night, all forty-one inscribed those words. On their swords, their armor, their staves, their shields.

Ioleta Russell:
After that, we broke through on the east.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
And when you regrouped with the knightclub again, only seven knights were left once more.

Ioleta Russell:
Just as heaven willed.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
But three thousand enemies were wiped out, and the shields of those forty-six knights, all bearing the coats of arms of their respective families, were returned to Kazimierz. Not a single one was left behind.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Daybreak over the Golden Prairie. Every single campaign knight knows this battle well, Grandmaster.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
We salute you!

Ioleta Russell:
The Armorless Union wants to harm the children of the Nearl family?

Ioleta Russell:
Hah. I wonder if they have enough forces in their reserves.

Greatmouth Mob:
––What an explosion! The Arts wrapped around our two competitors came into contact, causing a huge blast!

Greatmouth Mob:
The first to appear from the smoke–– is the Blood Knight! The Blood Knight's been repelled! He's holding his axe in his other hand now–– not his dominant hand! Did his arm go numb from the impact?!

Greatmouth Mob:
On the other side–– Margaret's supporting herself using her strange swordspear! Without a doubt, the Blood Knight came out on top in this last exchange––

The Blood Knight:
Kuh...!

Greatmouth Mob:
––The Blood Knight is charging again! Does the Radiant Knight have time to react?!

Margaret:
—!

The Blood Knight:
What...?!

Margaret:
Too bad, but I'm one step ahead of you.

The Blood Knight:
Your movements... There's no way skills like that could've been tempered in this playground.

The Blood Knight:
Who did you fight for during your time in exile? When facing an attack, your first instinct is not to evade and counterattack, but to withstand the blow.

Margaret:
A knight's duty is to defend, even if it means giving her life.

The Blood Knight:
Is it now?

The Blood Knight:
You are not the type to speak lightly of life and death. Show me then, just what life and death mean to you!

Greatmouth Mob:
What a dazzling display of close-quarters combat––! After the Radiant Knight repelled the onslaught, the two seem to locked in a never-ending melee–– Wait, it's not that simple!

Greatmouth Mob:
––A huge pool of blood is appearing beneath the two combatants' feet! It's the Blood Knight's trap!

The Blood Knight:
(Minoan) Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Exsanguination, to me.

The pool of blood seems to congeal into sticky silk strands, tangling themselves around Margaret's limbs.

The blood flowing through the pegasus's body resonates with its compatriot, causing a tingling pain.

Margaret:
––As if I'd let you!

The Blood Knight:
What?! You severed the resonance with your Arts...?

The Blood Knight:
–––Hraagh!

Greatmouth Mob:
What a turn of events!! The Blood Knight was trying to control the Radiant Knight using his Arts, but was unexpectedly rebuked! With a hack and smash of the Radiant Knight's swordspear, her opponent has fallen to the ground!

Greatmouth Mob:
This is the first time in the Major that the Blood Knight has been forced to his knees! I'm sure everyone heard that thunderous impact! Just how much damage did our defending champion take?!

Margaret:
You should have been able to easily take a blow like that.

The Blood Knight:
......

The Blood Knight rises to his feet wordlessly and once again brandishes his massive axe, swinging it straight at his opponent's head.

The Radiant Knight:
(It's a sweeping strike–– but his swing is too erratic!)

The Blood Knight:
......!

A jolt of pain wracks his entire body, forcing the Blood Knight's axe to shift downward slightly.

Margaret:
Urgh—

Margaret:
What... incredible strength...

The Blood Knight:
......

To him, this pain is both foreign and familiar.

It is unlike being burnt, cut, or frostburned. It is unlike any pain he has ever felt in the arena.

This pain comes from the depths of his body.

His disease.

A tipping point.

The Blood Knight:
That last blow of yours... hit me hard.

The Blood Knight:
How do you like this then?

Blood glistens and condenses into an amorphous ball of light.

Margaret has no time to weigh her options. She has to interrupt his Arts.

A glowing aura emerges from behind her.

This light, given form, is strong enough to melt all suffering.

A Spectator A:
Go get 'er, Blood Knight!

A Spectator B:
Stay away from him! Finish him off with your Arts, Margaret!

Roy:
Knights really are popular, aren't they?

Monique:
Everyone is in position.

Roy:
My dear Monique, would you imagine how nice it would've been if we never formed the Armorless Union, but instead became knights?

Monique:
......

Roy:
How are things for Platinum?

Monique:
I almost feel bad for her.

Platinum:
......

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
......

Platinum:
......

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
...Hmm.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
The Armorless Union... is just you bunch?

Platinum:
Laugh all you want. Not like I can see your expression under that helmet anyway.

Platinum:
'Silverlance Pegasus,' huh. Are a few Armorless not good enough for you to sink your teeth into?

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
......

Platinum:
The leaders of the Union, and thirty of our members. And you only sent seven.

Platinum:
Are you saying that we don't stand a chance against just seven of you?

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
No...

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Three of us will suffice.

Platinum:
......

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
......

Greatmouth Mob:
It's a spear of light! Wait, no, that's the Blood Knight's axe–– it's covered with an aura of blood! But, the Radiant Knight dodged–– Wait, it's a feint! The Radiant Knight's swordspear–– Whew...

Greatmouth Mob:
I... I have no words to describe what's going on right now! I've never seen such fierce fighting! I'm afraid even an instant replay wouldn't clear it up for us––

The Candle Knight:
Jealous, Tytus?

Left-hand Knight:
......

Shining:
The Blood Knight... is very powerful.

Shining:
I thought... there weren't any Infected who could have such a commanding presence...

Amiya:
I never thought this city could cultivate an iron will like that.

Shining:
Nearl always told me Kazimierz had forgotten the meaning of glory.

Shining:
This city always gave me that impression. Grandstanding, superficial. Mired in an unfathomable depth of consumerism and commercialism.

Shining:
But...

Amiya:
But the people living in this city, every person still fighting to survive... They are all driven on by the conviction in their hearts.

Amiya:
Nearl was right. That glory, those virtues... will never be forgotten.

Margaret––!

Amiya:
Huh? Isn't that...

Maria:
Margaret––! You can do it!!

Old Knight:
This is no ordinary match. Don't you think our cheering is a bit too ordinary?

Old Craftsman:
It's the thought that counts. Not like Margaret can hear us with how big the crowd is.

Old Knight:
Why don't we keep our eyes peeled for the Armorless Union instead? Even if the old bigwigs of the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi let us come, who knows if the Union is still hiding out there?

Zofia:
Margaret––!! Take him down!

Maria:
Margaret––!

Bald Marcin:
The audience's cheers were always only meant for their own ears.

Bald Marcin:
Even if Margaret can't hear them, as long as she remembers that people are supporting her, she will not fall.

Amiya:
Does that mean she's...

Nightingale:
A Nearl... Margaret's little sister, Maria.

Nightingale:
Just as Margaret said, everyone eventually came together, right?

Greatmouth Mob:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
...Uhh...

Greatmouth Mob:
(Is the referee still keeping score? No? O-Okay then...)

The Blood Knight:
Radiant Knight!

Margaret:
—!

The Blood Knight:
Hraaagh––!!

The Blood Knight:
Splendid! You're the only one who could withstand this attack head-on!

The Radiant Knight:
Likewise... What kind of power is this...

The Blood Knight stands firm and lifts his axe.

Once the Blood Arts enveloping his weapon fades, the once-adamantine Minoan axe crumbles like dust.

Only half of the Radiant Knight's swordspear remains. Its shattered blade punctured the Blood Knight's helmet, revealing his determination-filled eyes.

Maria:
Margaret's swordspear broke?! I went through so much effort to reinforce it!

Zofia:
The Blood Knight's strength is beyond doubt... but he's also lost his weapon!

Zofia:
Now both of them... are unarmed...

Margaret:
......

The Blood Knight:
...Marvelous...

The Blood Knight:
This is the first time... I've ever felt that the knight competitions... could bring real joy.

Margaret:
Oh?

The Blood Knight:
I recall my hometown. Those white buildings surrounding that pristine, blue lake.

The Blood Knight:
At the end of the road was a row of blue fences, with a pot of jasmine flowers placed there.

The rusty smell of blood.

The flowing heat of blood.

The raw determination of blood.

Margaret:
Minos is a beautiful place, Blood Knight.

The Blood Knight:
Many knights fight for wealth. Some, for fame.

The Blood Knight:
But we, the Infected, only fight for survival.

The Blood Knight:
Every match I win, I live a day longer. Another day to spend in the dumps. It's not easy.

The Blood Knight:
What about you, Radiant Knight?

The Blood Knight:
You are much stronger than I imagined... What have you been through?

The Radiant Knight:
......

Amiya:
Oh! Nearl is looking over at us?

Shining:
It seems so.

Nightingale:
You can do this, Nearl!

Maria:
Margaret! You've got this––!!

Zofia:
Margaret, you'd better not lose! I swear, if you end up losing––!

Old Knight:
Hahaha, it doesn't matter, as long as they have a good rumble.

Old Craftsman:
You bet. It's been so long since I've seen anyone like that Margaret. It's making my hands itchy, old timer.

Bald Marcin:
(Smiles silently) ......

Margaret:
...Tragedy.

Margaret:
I've seen an entire city crumble beneath a Catastrophe. The Infected, slaughtering innocent civilians, stacking their bodies high and burning them as a warning.

Margaret:
I've seen bounty hunters torment the poor and downtrodden for sport, parents selling their young children for uncontaminated food and water.

Margaret:
I've seen unimaginable tragedy I could never imagine in Kazimierz. However, I also met a group of people... clawing their way forward through that suffering.

Margaret:
I am not alone, Blood Knight.

The Blood Knight:
And yet, after seeing all that, you still chose to come back to Kazimierz, to reclaim your narrow-minded ideals?

Margaret:
...Yes.

The Blood Knight:
......

The Blood Knight:
Then, you are no longer narrow-minded.

The Blood Knight:
This is my last strike, Radiant Knight.

The Blood Knight:
Come. Let's settle this without any further delay. Thinking about anything else... is a right reserved only for the victor!

The Radiant Knight:
Blood Knight Dikaiopolis, you truly are a great knight.

The Blood Knight:
And determining which of is the victor... shall bring glory to all of Kazimierz.

Margaret:
My name is Margaret Nearl! My family motto is, 'Fear neither hardship nor darkness!'

The Blood Knight:
(Minoan) From this day forth, I am no longer alone!

Roy:
So, will the Blood Knight win, and make things easy for everyone... or will the Radiant Knight win, and we get our hands dirty?

Toland:
Excuse me, is anyone sitting here?

Toland:
Never thought I'd get to watch the finals on a big screen from the side of the street. What a metropolitan life, hmm?

Platinum:
......

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
...Absolutely dazzling.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Margaret shines even brighter than before. Losing her would be a huge blow to the Silverlances.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
But when you look at her like this... she really is a rebel after all.

Monique:
Teams 3 and 4, wait for instructions by the entrance.

Monique:
Team 5, enter the arena and mark Rhodes Island. Team 6, mark Maria's group.

Ioleta Russell:
The Nearl family has a tendency to produce the most incredible, and the most stubborn people.

Ioleta Russell:
Wouldn't you agree, Młynar?

Młynar:
......

Iwona:
......

Justyna:
Always feels to me like... it doesn't matter who wins.

Justice Knight:
(Clicks quietly)

Greynuty:
This is a duel between knights.

Sona:
The Blood Knight and the Radiant Knight... they are shining paragons.

Sona:
But, that's not where our battles are. The things we want can't be found there either.

Sona:
They opened the way for us... and we must keep fighting.

Greatmouth Mob:
The two combatants, now without their weapons, are now condensing their Arts to have one last showdown!

Greatmouth Mob:
What a lengthy struggle! After the light fades, who will be the first to fall?!

An Infected Knight:
......

An Observing Knight:
......

Some of the knights at the venue stop their hoarse shouting and cheering.

They slowly rise to their feet, silently waiting for the conclusion.

Left-hand Knight:
I...

Left-hand Knight:
......

The Candle Knight:
The Blood Knight... is at his limit.

Nightmare Knight:
This is a tribute, Kazimierz.

Nightmare Knight:
A hero has risen.

A thunderous roar.

A symphony of clashing sounds.

Each time weapons collide, sparks burst forth and obscure the fight.

The first to fall will be defeated.

The Blood Knight:
...Nngh!

His step falters.

The hero's body has long dried up from his blood-manipulating Arts.

The Blood Knight:
...Radiant Knight.

The Blood Knight:
How long will you remain in Kazimierz? Will you continue... to kindle this land's lighthouse?

The Radiant Knight:
When I returned to my homeland––

The Radiant Knight:
––I already steeled myself, to never run.

The Blood Knight:
...Good.

The Blood Knight:
Come. We shouldn't leave any regrets behind.

The Radiant Knight:
Right.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm sorry, Dr. {@nickname}.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
This duel... won't have any meaning.

Greatmouth Mob:
......!

An Infected Knight:
...Salute... Salute the Blood Knight.

An Infected Knight:
...Salute! Our hero!

The Candle Knight:
...Knight.... Knight...

The Blood Knight gazes at the sky.

He can no longer move a muscle.

The sky.

Even if the nomadic city has moved past that lightless night, the Blood Knight still remembers.

He remembers there was never a moment... when the night surrendered to the city.

The Blood Knight:
...It's your win, Radiant Knight.

Fresh blood spills onto the ground.

Though unable to maintain the basic structure of his Arts, the Blood Knight still clutches the weapon that looks like it could dissipate at any moment.

The Blood Knight:
......

The Blood Knight:
No! What are you doing? The winner... should not be propping up the loser...

The Radiant Knight:
*cough*... There is no loser here, Blood Knight.

The Blood Knight:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
W-W-We have a winner!!

Greatmouth Mob:
The one left standing at the end–– No, more accurately, the Radiant Knight is holding up the Blood Knight! The Blood Knight... can't stand on his own!!

Greatmouth Mob:
The panel is still tallying up the score, and until now, their scores were neck-and-neck! But, based on what we just saw–– if the Blood Knight is unable to continue fighting, then––

Greatmouth Mob:
Then, without a doubt––

Greatmouth Mob:
––The champion of Kazimierz's 24th Special Knight Tournament... is none other than––

Greatmouth Mob:
...THE RADIANT KNIGHT! MAAAARGAREEEET NEAAARRRRLLL!!!

Monique:
––Execute the plan.

Monique:
The various teams are moving to strike. The special detachment has entered the arena, targeting Maria Nearl and Whislash Knight.

Monique:
While the crowd is in chaos––

Roy:
What a deafening roar of applause.

Roy:
I really do envy the knights' popularity.

Toland:
There are some knights who aren't as popular.

Roy:
It seems like you have some other reason for saying that?

Toland:
The old knight-lords always remain at the very top. Frustrating, isn't it?

Roy:
How curious. I wonder what kind of lives you bounty hunters lead to be able to mingle with the knights?

Toland:
Ursus artillery destroyed our town. We became a pack of hunters in need of prey to survive.

Toland:
One rainy night, we hunted a wild mangler until dawn, only to discover that a 'knight' had long snatched up our prey.

Roy:
Oh, that seems like an interesting story.

Toland:
He was a decked-out princeling, all glittering and gold, pretending to use the rain to wash off the blood on his face. So we asked, what would a knight be doing all the way out here.

Toland:
Wanna guess what he said?

Roy:
What?

Toland:
He said, 'I'm not a knight yet, just a wanderer.' Then he asked us, 'Who were you again?'

Roy:
......

Monique:
Grr.

Roy:
Oh my, Monique, when'd you decide to fly in? I thought your part of the operation was quite some distance from here.

Roy:
And what's more, you even got hurt.

Monique:
Cut the crap, Roy. Either call the thing off, or come help me out over here.

Młynar:
......

Roy:
Now what kind of wind would be able to blow our own 'wanderer' back here?

Roy the Lazurite is about to get up, but a hand presses down on his shoulder.

A Sarkaz hand.

Roy:
......

Toland:
Heh. 'Wanderer,' huh? At the time, I thought to myself, why the hell are you playing dumb?

Toland:
So this is what I said back to him––

Toland:
––'Standing before you is Kazimierz's strongest bounty hunter.'

Cheers:
Radiant Knight! Radiant Knight! Radiant Knight!

Greatmouth Mob:
A few months ago, what analyst could've predicted this outcome?! That our champion would be the Radiant Knight, Margaret Nearl, after suddenly and shockingly returning to the arena?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Now, let your cheers fill this arena! The prize pool for today's competition has reached an unbelievable amount!

Greatmouth Mob:
It's no exaggeration to say that the Radiant Knight's legendary experience has scored her enough wealth to rival that of an entire corporation!

Greatmouth Mob:
Even the General Chamber of Commerce will be here today to make a huge announcement to everyone!

Greatmouth Mob:
To our wonderful friends in the arena and those watching from home! The Knights Association officially confirmed yesterday that they will hold a champion's press conference tomorrow. But right now, there's a truth we must share with all of you!

Greatmouth Mob:
Six years ago, the Radiant Knight was exiled by the Knights Association for 'concealing her status as an Infected!' But today, the Radiant Knight's name has finally been cleared!

Greatmouth Mob:
Her exile was the result of a criminal conspiracy! The scoundrels bought off the Knights Association and forcibly expelled the Radiant Knight from the country on false pretenses!

Greatmouth Mob:
Yes indeed! Here, as a representative of the Knights Association, the National Council, and the General Chamber of Commerce, I solemnly announce to the entire audience––

Greatmouth Mob:
––that all accusations against the Radiant Knight are hereby dropped! The Radiant Knight, our great champion, is not an Infected!

Amiya:
Doctor!

Amiya:
Wait... Doctor, did you purposely...

Shining:
'If you deny your own heart, and conceal the truth from the world, there is no glory to be had.'

Shining:
Before Nearl left Rhodes Island, the Doctor told her about the possible consequences.

Shining:
Even if the K.G.C.C. does not take this as a threat, Nearl... will eventually call upon Rhodes Island to be her notary.

Shining:
For the sake of–– Wait, wait...

An Armorless Union Member:
......

Old Craftsman:
Why now of all times to come clean? Goddammit, the K.G.C.C. is trying to get the Infected to turn on each other!

Old Knight:
This is bad. They're trying to make it look like the Radiant Knight doesn't represent them, and that their champion lost––

Maria:
...To make it seem as if... my sister... lied to everyone.

Zofia:
Wh-What's going on? Is Margaret not Infected?

Bald Marcin:
......

Bald Marcin:
In order to protect the young and energetic Margaret, Old Nearl purposely had her exiled.

Maria:
She was exiled... because of Grandpa?

Bald Marcin:
Even Margaret herself did not know about this. She truly believed she had contracted Oripathy during the competitions, and even came to terms with it.

Bald Marcin:
But Oripathy is not something that can be hidden forever. After this many years, she must've discovered the truth long ago.

Maria:
...Margaret...

An Armorless Union Member:
(Now's our chance. Go, go!)

Amiya:
Stop right there!

An Armorless Union Member:
Ugh! What–?! What just knocked my dagger––?!

An Armorless Union Member:
You worthless–– I'll handle this!

Zofia:
The Armorless?! Maria, watch out!

Maria:
Huh?

Zofia stands her ground in front of Maria.

The Armorless assassin raises the dagger in his hand.

Shining:
...Despicable cutthroat.

An Armorless Union Member:
—?!

Zofia:
Gah! You did that with just your hilt?

An Armorless Union Member:
Damn you––!

Shining:
Innocent people will get hurt here.

Shining:
I'd prefer you not disturb the peace.

Old Knight:
This one's mine!

An Armorless Union Member:
Urgh!

Maria:
Th-Thanks, Shining...

An Infected Knight:
Hey, what's the meaning of this?! The Radiant Knight isn't Infected?!

An Infected Knight:
I... What kind of sick joke? I thought this whole time... she was fighting for the Infected! But all along, she...

A Spectating Knight:
Could it be that the Radiant Knight was lying to us?

Margaret:
......

The Blood Knight:
You've been made a pawn.

Margaret:
I realized it shortly after leaving Kazimierz.

Margaret:
Oripathy is like a curse, and yet my body... showed no signs of it.

Margaret:
The rest fell into place soon after that. My grandfather had me leave Kazimierz, all for the sake of protecting my rash and impetuous self.

Margaret:
The General Chamber of Commerce will not relent until the 'Radiant Knight' is no longer a thorn in their side.

The Blood Knight:
...*cough* *cough*... *cough* *cough*...

Margaret:
Here, lean on my shoulder.

The Blood Knight:
Many thanks.

Margaret:
If not for the worsening of your condition, I well could've been the one to lose this match.

The Blood Knight:
There's no point saying things like that... Do you think I fought my way here just to use my Oripathy as an excuse?

Margaret:
No.

The Blood Knight:
The Infected will not trust you.

The Blood Knight:
They are very wise. They did not let you spread your prestige among the masses. They set you up to be the villain.

Margaret:
Do you also think of me that way?

The Blood Knight:
Me? Hah......

The Blood Knight:
An Infected who fights for the Infected, or a normal person who fights for the Infected... Which is more noble?

The Blood Knight:
Some people do understand this principle, but, public opinion will ignite their extremism... The days you spend here will not be pleasant.

Greatmouth Mob:
It would seem that this news has already caused quite a stir–– Oh my, the panel has come to its final decision: the Radiant Knight's victory is well-deserved––!!

Greatmouth Mob:
Tonight, Kazimierz will crown a new champion! In two hours, the Radiant Knight, Margaret Nearl, will enter the annals of history at the Wall of Champions!!

Greatmouth Mob:
But don't go anywhere, because tomorrow, we'll have our grand closing ceremony! You won't want to miss it!

Margaret:
...Dikaiopolis.

The Blood Knight:
What?

Margaret:
A knight belongs where there is glory to be had.

The Blood Knight:
Of course. If you really wanted to give them a slap across the face, you could just ditch the award ceremony...

Margaret:
No, that would just be running away. Same as how I ran from Kazimierz back then.

The Blood Knight:
So... what's your plan?

Margaret:
We'll go together.

The Blood Knight:
......

The Blood Knight:
Hah... Hahaha... Interesting.

The Blood Knight:
It'd be my honor.

Greatmouth Mob:
Next, a few words from the host–– Wait, hold on! Something's happening down there!

Greatmouth Mob:
The Radiant Knight is ignoring the host! She... she's helping the Blood Knight up and heading for the arena's exit!

Greatmouth Mob:
What's the meaning of this?! Does the Radiant Knight plan to share the championship with the Blood Knight?!

An Infected Knight:
Damn you... Trying to virtue signal now that your lies are out in the open?!

An Infected Knight:
Drop the act already, Radiant Knight! Traitor to the Infected!

Greatmouth Mob:
––that all accusations against the Radiant Knight are hereby dropped! The Radiant Knight, our great champion, is not an Infected!

Greynuty:
What...?

Iwona:
The Radiant Knight... isn't an Infected?!

Justyna:
......

Justyna:
............

Iwona:
J-Justyna, are you alright...?

Justyna:
Yeah, I'm just... shocked.

Justyna:
Did the K.G.C.C. make that up?

Sona:
No.

Sona:
It's not difficult to frame a normal person as an Infected, but it is virtually impossible to hide an Infected.

Sona:
So, the Radiant Knight isn't an Infected...

Sona:
Then why... Why has she been fighting for us all this time?

An Armorless Union Member:
Monique! The Radiant Knight and the Blood Knight have left the arena! Do we go after them?

An Armorless Union Member:
...Monique? Hello?

An Armorless Union Member:
––Wh-What's going on? What happened in the arena?

Platinum:
Grr... They weren't kidding when they said three was enough. Practically snapping my arrows like toothpicks...

An Armorless Union Member:
D-Did he seriously cleave that pillar with just a swing of his sword? Those pillars have to be made out of cardboard or something, right?

Platinum:
Calm down, we're out of our depth here. Let's back up for now and regroup with the main force.

Platinum:
The only weakness of the 'Silverlance Pegasi' is their stubborn adherence to tradition. They won't have any other tricks up their sleeves.

Greatmouth Mob:
What?! What's going on?! Someone's attacking the Wall!

Greatmouth Mob:
(The Armorless Union?! They would dare to launch an attack when the audience hasn't even left yet?!)

Greatmouth Mob:
Everyone, p-please don't panic! Security! Yes, security will make sure you get to safety––!

Roy:
––I thought the knights of the Nearl family were supposed to be all shiny and glowing.

Młynar:
......

Roy:
Seriously though, Młynar. Why stick your nose where it doesn't belong? You aren't even a knight, and if you plan to stay in the Grand Knight Territory, you know better than to anger the K.G.C.C.

Młynar:
...Ten years.

Roy:
Huh?

Młynar:
I worked for ten years, and not once did I ask for a leave over personal matters.

Młynar:
In other words... Right now, I am legally entitled to three months of vacation.

Roy:
......

Monique:
Gah... Stop scurrying around, you pesky bounty hunter.

Toland:
Haha, Młynar Nearl on vacation? That's a perverse joke if I've ever heard one.

Młynar:
––One more thing, Roy.

Roy:
Huh?

Light flashes through the Lazurite's vision.

Like the morning breeze wafting through a forest, it is neither strong nor conspicuous. Almost as if the lake's surface could block it.

But in a heartbeat, Młynar's sword is resting against the Lazurite's neck.

Roy:
......!

Młynar:
Whether or not we're knights... is not for you to decide.

Roy:
Haha, then who does get to decide?

Młynar:
Kazimierz has no right to dub me.

Margaret:
Are you still able to walk?

The Blood Knight:
I'm fine... But more importantly, have you thought about what doing this means?

Margaret:
I'm just reclaiming the title of 'knight' from them.

A Tourist:
L-Look, isn't that the Blood Knight and the Radiant Knight?!

A Tourist:
Are they going to walk to the Wall of Champions like that?! Hey, c'mere and take a picture, quick!

Platinum:
What's the situation?

An Armorless Union Member:
We can't reach the two Lazurites... The Radiant Knight and Blood Knight are slowly moving towards the Wall of Champions exhibition hall.

Platinum:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

A Corporate Employee:
Spokesman... The Radiant Knight and the Blood Knight are headed for the Wall of Champions together, and the Board of Directors is very unhappy about this development...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Have the Armorless stop them. Otherwise, they'll be branded as enemies of the K.G.C.C.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
This is for their own good.

A Corporate Employee:
Understood. Oh and a letter for you that came in this morning.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
A letter?

A Corporate Employee:
Yes. According to the Messenger, it was signed 'Your Friend.'

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Just leave it over there. I'll see you later.

A Corporate Employee:
Hm? All right then...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Dr. {@nickname}... I'm sorry, but this is all I can do for you.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Forgive me. Forgive me for not even daring to read your letter.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Maybe only after you've left the Grand Knight Territory... will I have the right to respond to it.

Margaret:
......

The Blood Knight:
Has this road... always been this long?

Margaret:
You're wounded, so we're walking slower.

The Blood Knight:
......

An Infected Knight:
Look! Look over there!

An Armorless Union Member:
Block the road!

An Armorless Union Member:
Radiant Knight, Blood Knight, there are countless crossbows pointed at you. All we ask... is that you turn back right now.

An Armorless Union Member:
Those are the orders we got from the K.G.C.C. We do not wish to have to strike down our two champions.

The Blood Knight:
It seems... that our pilgrimage ends here.

The Blood Knight:
Go. My head has already been bowed in defeat for a long time. I will let them know––

An arrow lodges into the ground between the two knights and the Armorless.

An Armorless Union Member:
Who's there?!

Justice Knight:
(Excited clicking noises)

An Armorless Union Member:
You're––

Iwona:
What are you looking at, Armorless scum?

An Armorless Union Member:
––Enemies! The Infected are attacking! Fiiiiire!!

Greynuty:
Your bolts won't reach our champion, Armorless.

Greynuty:
Try this on for size!

An Armorless Union Member:
The Infected are here!! Call for backup––

An Armorless Union Member:
What?! Our comms are cut off?

Justyna:
A perfect shot.

The Blood Knight:
......

Margaret:
It's you...

Sona:
This would be our second official meeting, right? Our two champions.

Sona:
If we find the time, I'd love to get autographs from both of you––

Sona:
But for now, keep moving forward. Just follow this road down to the end, right through the city.

Sona:
This is the greatest of causes.

Platinum:
Pinus Sylvestris again? Looks like the campaign knights still haven't shown up.

Platinum:
Wandering into a nice, wide-open space like that is just begging to get sniped––

???:
Don't move.

Platinum:
......

Szewczyk:
Let them go, Platinum.

A Voice from the Communicator:
Requesting backup! Requesting backup!

Monique:
Roy, we can't be wasting any more time.

Roy:
Grrr... Look for a chance to retreat. I'll stop them.

Monique:
...Be careful.

Toland:
What'cha mumbling about over there?

Młynar:
......

Roy:
Haha... Well, well... hasn't this turned into a pain in the ass.

An Armorless Union Member:
We're in position––

Greynuty:
Sona, there's no end to these Armorless goons! We'll be in trouble if this drags on!

Iwona:
Hey, come help us out, you bunch of louts!

An Infected Knight:
......

Iwona:
Tsk... What a bunch of cowards.

Justyna:
Iwona, behind you!

Iwona:
—

Maria:
Are you okay?

Sona:
Maria!

Maria:
I'm here to help!

An Armorless Union Member:
It's Maria Nearl! Get them––!

Zofia:
Keep your hands off her.

Old Knight:
Kowal, you ready over there?!

Old Craftsman:
Way ahead of you!

An Armorless Union Member:
You should've stayed in your nursing home... Surround them!

An Armorless Union Member:
What's going on? Why's my weapon shaking?

Bald Marcin:
Heehee... I wonder why?

Spokesman McKee:
The Radiant Knight's actions are a slap across the face to the K.G.C.C.

Spokesman McKee:
Is this the rest of the Union? What about the two Sarkaz knights?

An Armorless Union Member:
W-We haven't seen them... since the last time they tried to assassinate Nightzmora...

Spokesman McKee:
Forget it. Get out there and back up our forces. We MUST stop the Radiant Knight and the Blood Knight.

Spokesman McKee:
Even if you have to kill them–

The Candle Knight:
McKee.

Spokesman McKee:
......!

She holds up a ball of candlelight.

A beautiful, wispy glow.

The Candle Knight:
Just leave them alone, won't you?

An Armorless Union Member:
Teams 7 and 8 are in position.

An Armorless Union Member:
We've got a lot of witnesses, more every minute, but we have to do it anyway. Get ready to take the shot on the Grand Knights–

(Footsteps).

The onlookers, the knights, the Armorless Union, and the members of Pinus Sylvestris locked in combat, all stop what they were doing.

Like children witnessing the steel leviathan that is a train roar past for the first time.

Sona:
...That's...

Iwona:
The 'Silverlance Pegasi!'

An Armorless Union Member:
......

The Armorless subconsciously stop their attack and lower their weapons.

Their breathing turns solemn, as if a single rash move would result in bloody retribution.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
......

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Margaret.

Margaret:
That voice! Uncle Liam?

Margaret:
You've...

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Even now, you intend to stay your path?

Margaret:
Soldiers are a part of the country.

Margaret:
Soldiers carry out duty, not justice.

Margaret:
I've already told you this.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Indeed, I cannot lift an Infected through the entire city.

The Blood Knight:
......

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Heed my orders.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Escort the Radiant Knight and the Blood Knight to the Wall of Champions exhibition hall.

Ioleta Russell:
A single road.

Ioleta Russell:
So many people, so many events, all converging alongside you.

Ioleta Russell:
How it reminds me of you, back in the day.

Monique:
Report the Radiant Knight's current position.

An Armorless Union Member:
Monique! Thank goodness, we finally got through to you––

Monique:
Hurry!

An Armorless Union Member:
Yes ma'am! They'll reach the Wall in about ten minutes–– a Silverlance Pegasus squad is escorting them. We can't make a move!

Monique:
I'll snipe her. I'll only get one shot at this.

Monique:
Once my position is exposed... the Silverlance Pegasi can strike clear through a building.

Monique:
You must draw their attention.

An Armorless Union Member:
Roger!

Amiya:
Madam Grand Knight.

Ioleta Russell:
Oho, if it isn't little Amiya. Come here. Have you enjoyed your stay in Kazimierz?

Amiya:
Mhm...

Amiya:
We managed to solve a lot of problems, all thanks to the Doctor.

Ioleta Russell:
Without Rhodes Island serving as mediators with the General Chamber of Commerce, the situation in Area 0 would not have been resolved peacefully. You have my thanks.

Amiya:
It's what we do.

Ioleta Russell:
And you must be Dr. {@nickname}? Several companies suddenly started submitting applications regarding Area 0 to the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi, giving us ample 'grounds' to conduct an investigation.

Ioleta Russell:
Was this also your work?

Ioleta Russell:
Did Gravel did a good job?

Gravel:
......

Amiya:
Oh, of course!

Amiya:
She helped us a great deal!

Ioleta Russell:
Then maybe it's time for her to leave the nest and hone her skills elsewhere.

Ioleta Russell:
But that's a discussion for another day. As for these two Sarkaz... You go by Shining and Nightingale, right?

Shining:
I'm listening.

Ioleta Russell:
It's not often that Sarkaz visit these halls... Go meet the Radiant Knight. She needs people she can rely on.

Ioleta Russell:
Go.

Margaret:
I see it.

Margaret:
That golden, glistening exhibition hall.

The Blood Knight:
......

The Blood Knight:
Haha... In what kind of sport... does the winner and loser share the pedestal?

The Blood Knight:
The folks on the Board of Directors must be livid right now.

Margaret:
Maybe.

The Blood Knight:
If we...

The Blood Knight:
—Watch out!

A lazurite bolt tears through the curtain of night.

In a flash, the tip is but hairs away from Margaret's face.

But––

What touches her first is a warm, gentle hand.

Shining:
Did you need a hand, Nearl?

The Blood Knight:
You... You're...

The breath of life permeates the space.

And the blue of his home, like a soaring fowlbeast, lands on the Sarkaz's shoulder.

Shining turns to face a certain direction, her lips curling up slightly.

Monique:
...'The Fourth Arrow,' huh?

Monique:
That's too bad.

The Blood Knight:
Sarkaz, what relationship do you have... with the Radiant Knight?

Shining:
Companions.

Nightingale:
Go, Nearl.

Margaret:
Right.

Ioleta Russell:
Welcome, Margaret, Dikaiopolis.

The Blood Knight:
...The Grand Knight...

The Blood Knight:
I've never seen this place... without flashing lights and a sea of reporters...

Ioleta Russell:
They didn't have the guts to push through the campaign knights to conduct their interviews.

Ioleta Russell:
Just for tonight... the Wall of Champions belongs only to the knights.

Margaret:
Never has that sounded more ironic.

Ioleta Russell:
This exhibition hall predates the existence of the knight competitions. In the past, this place was a museum that preserved the relics of those heroes...

Ioleta Russell:
That was a long time ago.

Margaret:
......

Ioleta Russell:
You still haven't changed your mind, right?

Margaret:
That's right.

The Blood Knight:
Margaret, you...

Ioleta Russell:
Very well. Just like I couldn't convince your grandfather back then... Come, come closer, and let me have a look at you.

Ioleta Russell:
Kirill's granddaughter is all grown up now... It's uncanny how much you take after him. He... would've been proud.

Ioleta Russell:
What you seek to do goes against the flow of the times, Margaret.

Ioleta Russell:
You don't need the privilege of the military, of nobility, or of competitive fame.

Ioleta Russell:
This is only your beginning, young lady. Even after all these twists and turns, you've only just begun your tumultuous journey.

Ioleta Russell:
It's almost dawn.
