Zofia:
Alright, let's wrap it up!

Zofia:
Does it still hurt?

Margaret:
Nope. Never been better.

Zofia:
Looks like your arm has made a complete recovery. The Wind Knight suddenly forfeiting was a huge help.

Maria:
Margaret! I've finished upgrading your swordspear!

Maria:
I tried incorporating some Minoan techniques: maintaining excellent Arts transmission on one side, and using a special polymer coat to improve concentration on the other––

Maria:
In any case, this'll make your weapon both lighter and sharper!

Old Craftsman:
Hah, used just about everything in my shop to boot.

Old Craftsman:
You have my assurances, this is the best sword– err, lance? Right, swordspear, that we've ever made.

Old Craftsman:
The sword you won your first championship with was the second best. And that warhammer you took with you was the third best.

Margaret:
Thank you.

Old Craftsman:
Hah, don't mention it!

Bald Marcin:
Zofia, these are all the records I've found on the Blood Knight's matches.

Zofia:
Good. Time is of the essence.

Zofia:
Margaret, we have to go into this fully prepared. Margaret?

Margaret:
......

Margaret:
Thank you... All of you, for supporting me.

Roy:
This may well be our final mission, Monique.

Monique:
Yeah, I know.

Monique:
Are we really going to attack the Radiant Knight?

Roy:
The Board is still split. We'll have Platinum do the dirty work.

Monique:
And Darksteel also authorized the attack? Why? After this is over, why would we still be concerned with the Radiant Knight?

Roy:
I don't know. Maybe Darksteel felt threatened by the Radiant Knight... Since the Board is on the same page, that works out nicely.

Roy:
They're already wary of us. Until Darksteel gives us the signal, we would do well to avoid exposing ourselves.

Roy:
In any case, let's just pray that the Blood Knight can defeat the Radiant Knight. That'd make things a whole lot easier for all of us.

Monique:
Who do you think has a better chance of winning?

Roy:
It's hard to say...

Greatmouth Mob:
I, I'm going to be the commentator for the finals? Me?!

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The numbers don't lie, Mob. You are now one of the top tournament commentators. Congratulations.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Additionally, you've been a part of the Nearl sisters' story since Maria. The Board of Directors also sees this as a selling point, and hopes to work with you more.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Have you seen the latest issue of 'Knights Illustrated?' You've been dubbed 'The Voice That Walks With the Light.' You're now a household name.

Greatmouth Mob:
R-Really?!!

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
And lest we forget... Your bonus will be credited to your account tomorrow. There will be something else for you, after the Major.

Greatmouth Mob:
Does that mean I'll finally be able to bring my parents to the Grand Knight Territory?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Of course. You could buy them a huge villa, if you want.

Amiya:
...tickets... to the finals?

Ioleta Russell:
Rhodes Island's help has been instrumental to this year's Kazimierz Major. We've learned much from you in terms of dealing with Oripathy.

Ioleta Russell:
The winner of this year's Major will be decided between the Radiant Knight and the Blood Knight—a final match between two Infected.

Ioleta Russell:
As such, I believe that Rhodes Island should be there to watch this unprecedented final match.

Ioleta Russell:
Also, if I'm not mistaken, those two Sarkaz ladies over there are quite close to Margaret, yes?

Shining:
Thank you for your generosity.

Nightingale:
Nearl... She'll win, right?

Ioleta Russell:
You'll have to see for yourself, young lady.

Amiya:
So we have four tickets...

Amiya:
You have to come with me too, Doctor!

Gravel:
And naturally, I'll have to come along to ensure Doctor's safety.

Amiya:
That leaves us with two...

Hibiscus:
I really want to see Nearl's dazzling performance, but the medic team is kind of tied down...

Hibiscus:
But! Doctor, Amiya, you two should go for sure!

Hibiscus:
And if Shining and Nightingale go as well, that makes four!

Shining:
I can't just leave the medic team like that.

Hibiscus:
The Major is about to end anyway, so there aren't as many people who need treatment!

Hibiscus:
Besides, didn't the Doctor do a wonderful job for the Infected here? I imagine the situation will be pretty stable for a while–

Hibiscus:
If I were in Nearl's shoes, I'd be heartbroken if none of my friends came to support me during the finals!

Shining:
Hehe, you have a point.

Shining:
Liz, do you want to see Nearl's victory?

Nightingale:
Mhm...

Shining:
Okay.

Shining:
Doctor, Amiya... Please allow us to join you.

Sona:
The finals are between the Blood Knight and the Radiant Knight

Sona:
No matter who wins... the next champion will be one of us.

Toland:
The Area 0 conspiracy has been brought to light, and the one behind it has stepped down. The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi has promised you asylum, and you can start your life anew.

Toland:
It really is a fairytale ending, huh?

Sona:
......

Toland:
––But that's not really the case, is it?

Toland:
Looking at today's news, discussions about the Infected continue. The Armorless can be dealt with. The K.G.C.C. can be dealt with. But how can we deal with the public's fear of Oripathy?

Toland:
You fought against the K.G.C.C. and the Union. But the latter is just a group of sellswords, and the former is the foundation of modern Kazimierz.

Toland:
Flametail Knight, Sona.

Toland:
Is this all it takes?

Sona:
............

Sona:
Something's been on my mind recently, Toland. Since you aren't from the Grand Knight Territory, you might have a better sense of this than we do.

Sona:
Can we really improve the lives of the Infected just by defeating the K.G.C.C. and the Armorless Union?

Sona:
Honestly, can we even really defeat the K.G.C.C.?

A Commentator:
A Minoan clad in blood-red armor! A warrior from the frontier of storms, a Forte of boundless might!

A Commentator:
Put your hands together fooooor... independent knight... DIIIKAAAIOOPOOOLIIIS!!!

A Spectator:
Oi, Minoan, your name is too hard to remember!

A Spectator:
Cave the other guy's head in! I believe in you!

Dikaiopolis:
...... (Exhales)

A Commentator:
Let the match–– BEGIIIIIN!!

A Corporate Employee:
...Listen, Minoan. You're an Infected.

A Corporate Employee:
We've managed to hide it, and you've been able to scrounge up a bit of recognition in the underground arena.

A Corporate Employee:
Now there are several knightclubs in the Grand Knight Territory that are interested in you... This is a prime opportunity to make a lot of money.

A Corporate Employee:
As long as you get noticed by one of those big-name knightclubs, we're gonna go to the moons, I tell you!

A Corporate Employee:
But! There's no way they would let an Infected become a knight. In a small pond like ours, we might be able to hide it, but once we go to the Grand Knight Territory, it'll be too risky.

Dikaiopolis:
So what's your plan?

A Corporate Employee:
So! We pretend to sign a contract, then have you compete a few rounds and make some quick cash. Then we'll have you get 'injured' and withdraw from the tournament...

A Corporate Employee:
As for the official medical documentation, I'll try to grease some palms. We've gotta coordinate this thing perfectly! Right, Di–– Err...

Dikaiopolis:
Just call me 'Minoan.'

Dikaiopolis:
No need to remember my name.

A Corporate Employee:
For your sake, you really should change your name to something strong and powerful-sounding, and easy to remember. Even a stage name is fine. You get me?

A Corporate Employee:
Let's get going! Onwards, to the Grand Knight Territory!

Greatmouth Mob:
Unbelievable! Who would've expected this newcomer to take down Whitemaple Knight?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Look at that blood-red armor and that deadly crimson edge! He condensed his blood into a mighty weapon that even a swift and agile competitor like Whitemaple Knight could not evade!

Greatmouth Mob:
Incredible strength! Awe-inspiring physique! Exceptional situational awareness! All in a sensational-looking package that is sure to sell!

Greatmouth Mob:
There's no need to wait for the judges! Without a shadow of a doubt, the winner is–– Blazingaxe Knight!

Dikaiopolis:
*Pant*... *Pant*...

Dikaiopolis:
......

A Corporate Employee:
Pffft––

A Corporate Employee:
Th-The Major?!

A Corporate Employee:
Did you forget what we–– *cough* *cough*... Too many people here...

A Corporate Employee:
No way! Absolutely not! Do you remember how the previous champion ended up leaving Kazimierz?!

Dikaiopolis:
...Margaret Nearl, the Radiant Knight?

A Corporate Employee:
Yes, her! Born into a long line of heroes! The youngest champion in history! But did any of that add up to anything?

A Corporate Employee:
One sentence – 'She's an Infected,' and she's expelled from Kazimierz. The entire Nearl family, gone like dust in the wind.

A Corporate Employee:
Don't joke around like that. We need to behave ourselves and––

Spokesman Czarny:
Sir, are you Blazingaxe Knight, Dikaiopolis?

Dikaiopolis:
I am.

A Corporate Employee:
Oh, and who might you be...?

Spokesman Czarny:
Are you... his manager?

A Corporate Employee:
Haha, something like that.

Spokesman Czarny:
Ahh, wonderful. How fortunate.

Spokesman Czarny:
My name is Czarny, and I'm a spokesman for the General Chamber of Commerce.

Dikaiopolis:
...The Crimson Chalice Knightclub?

Spokesman Czarny:
Yes... A knightclub established specifically for you.

Spokesman Czarny:
You are an Infected. But when it comes to managing public opinion, I always prefer dredging to blocking.

Spokesman Czarny:
What do you think about this title? 'Kazimierz's Blood-Red Chalice.' This will be your iconic advertising slogan.

Dikaiopolis:
A chalice, huh. Such an elegant image doesn't suit someone as rough and unrefined as me.

Spokesman Czarny:
Don't say that.

Spokesman Czarny:
As for the other members... It might even be possible to make an entire order of Infected knights. But that would depend on what happens next.

Dikaiopolis:
Why would you go out of your way to do this? Aren't ordinary people afraid of the Infected?

Spokesman Czarny:
That's why 'ordinary people' never amount to anything.

Dikaiopolis:
Then, if the Infected can become knights, why was the Radiant Knight exiled?

Dikaiopolis:
How did the spectators feel about that?

Spokesman Czarny:
I do believe... that's where I come in, Dikaiopolis.

A Commentator:
The second Infected knight to cut his way through the Major! From Minos, Dikaiopolis! Over the last two years, 'Kazimierz's Blood-Red Chalice' has become a household name!

A Commentator:
Blazingaxe Knight's meteoric rise in both rank and popularity has been impossible to deny! His blood-red armor, his raw, visceral strength! He is, without a doubt, a true knight!

A Commentator:
Next, let me introduce you to his opponent for this round... independent knight Viviana Droste––

The Blood Knight:
The... Blood... Knight?

Spokesman McKee:
Yes. The Knights Association has just issued your official title.

Spokesman McKee:
Your proposal... a path for the Infected to gain official entry into the tournament, has been great reference material. As we speak, the Board is moving to make it a reality.

Spokesman McKee:
You and your Crimson Chalice Knightclub may well be the pilots for this new program. At the same time, this is also a declaration to all the Infected in Kazimierz that we have not given up on them.

Spokesman McKee:
Hopefully, this can keep the Infected problem from boiling over.

The Blood Knight:
Spokesman, will the Infected still face discrimination, even after becoming knights?

Spokesman McKee:
Unfortunately, they will. I can say this with near certainty.

Spokesman McKee:
No matter when or where, people will always dread this disease. If you want them to change their views, you must resort to radical methods.

The Blood Knight:
If it's just the disease, there's nothing wrong with being afraid of a disease.

The Blood Knight:
But the Infected are also victims, and Infected knights are still knights.

Spokesman McKee:
Being a victim is also a part of the disease. As for the status of knighthood... Do you still not understand?

The Blood Knight:
......

Spokesman McKee:
The medical community has never stopped researching Oripathy, but... progress has been too slow. The general view is that Oripathy cannot be understood in our current theoretical framework...

Spokesman McKee:
However, the good news is the Board of Directors is at least willing to meet with you and discuss your suggestions.

The Blood Knight:
Alright...

The Blood Knight:
Come join my knightclub.

An Infected Knight:
You... You're the champion?!

The Blood Knight:
Come with me, and we can live a normal life.

An Infected Knight:
But... we aren't that strong...

The Blood Knight:
I don't need you to accomplish anything special... For them, just having me is good enough.

An Infected Knight:
......!

An Infected Knight:
Ahaha... I thought I was going to get exiled, and die alone in the wilderness...

An Infected Knight:
But now, not I still stay in the city, and I can even stay in the same knightclub as the champion––

An Infected Knight:
I'll lay down my life for you! Thank you! Thank you so much!

An Infected Knight:
You are our saving grace, Blood Knight! Long live the Blood Knight!

An Infected Knight:
Long live the Blood Knight!

Sona:
...Let's go.

Greynuty:
You came here to get a glimpse of the Blood Knight?

Sona:
Just a glimpse is enough.

Sona:
We still have to follow our own path.

Greatmouth Mob:
This is unbelievable! Can you believe your eyes?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Because I sure can't! The Radiant Knight has suddenly entered the fight! The Knights Association that let it happen! Oh my god, I, this—

Greatmouth Mob:
I've never seen a situation like this in all my years of commentating! Though I don't know how the National Council will react, it doesn't change the fact that they won!

The Blood Knight:
......

The Blood Knight:
So that... is the Radiant Knight...

The Blood Knight:
For what reason... did you come back?

The Blood Knight:
This place is always bustling.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Congratulations on making the finals, Sir.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The deciding battle between you and the Radiant Knight will be upon us soon. Afterwards, the championship ceremony will be held here, and the champion will personally memorialize the victory––

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
––But, as you are the champion, this should all be familiar to you.

The Blood Knight:
The Major grows in size and scope each and every time. I don't like the bloated tournament formats and awards ceremonies you've tacked on.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Sorry about that.

The Blood Knight:
Has the portrait of the Radiant Knight been hung back up?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Yes. The Knights Association has reaffirmed the Radiant Knight's status, and she has been reinstated as Kazimierz's champion.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
...May I ask you a question?

The Blood Knight:
Of course, spokesman.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You and the Radiant Knight are both Infected. What do you think of her?

The Blood Knight:
She is a magnificent failure.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Oh?

The Blood Knight:
Her defiance. Her willpower. Her formidable abilities. In these areas, she is magnificent.

The Blood Knight:
But because she accomplished nothing with all that... she is a failure.

The Blood Knight:
To demonstrate her conviction, or to maintain her glory, she allowed herself to be exiled, dragging her entire family down.

The Blood Knight:
Was she really able to protect even a single person?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You don't seem to see eye-to-eye with her?

The Blood Knight:
These are two separate questions, spokesman.

The Blood Knight:
Does she need me to see eye-to-eye?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

A Spectating Knight:
The finals! Now this is a matchup worth the money!

A Spectating Knight:
The Blood Knight versus the Radiant Knight... I can't even imagine what kind of match this is going to be!!

A Leithanian Noblewoman:
My, oh my. So this is Kazimierz's famous knights' banquet? I must say, it indeed lives up to its reputation.

A Leithanian Noblewoman:
What kind of battle will we see between these two knights?

A Leithanian Nobleman:
Haha, the land of the knights always has some surprises up its sleeves, madam. All we need to do is wait and see.

A Corporate Employee:
Just half an hour until the round starts!

A Corporate Employee:
We've got a ton of spectators. Hey, use Section C as a guide for how to lead people in! Fill up Section I last!

A Corporate Employee:
Ah! Sorry, Sir, it's just too crowded––

Left-hand Knight:
Don't worry.

Spokesman McKee:
Are our preparations complete? Good.

Spokesman McKee:
Remember what Malkiewicz said. Regardless of whether or not the Radiant Knight wins, add that line into the final announcement.

Spokesman McKee:
Rhodes Island? They came to watch the match too? I see, under the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi's name... That's fine.

Spokesman McKee:
Pay utmost attention to security. Also, keep an eye on the movement of the campaign knights.

Spokesman McKee:
—

A Corporate Employee:
Um, spokesman? Your further instructions?

Spokesman McKee:
Sorry... Give me a moment.

Spokesman McKee:
...Madam Droste.

The Candle Knight:
McKee.

The Candle Knight:
It's been a while. What can I do for you?

Spokesman McKee:
I...

The Candle Knight:
......

'I've let you down.'

But, those words do not escape his lips.

McKee's hand seems to be fumbling about in midair, as if trying to buy some leeway for his chagrin.

But in the end, he gives up.

Spokesman McKee:
...I hope you enjoy the finals.

Amiya:
We made it! But, it's so crowded! Though you could've guessed that just from what was on TV.

Amiya:
Ah!

Amiya:
Okay.

Shining:
Over here, Doctor.

Amiya:
Nightingale, you should be careful as well.

Greatmouth Mob:
Right now, it's exactly 8 o'clock in the Grand Knight Territory! Welcome to the 24th Grand Finals of the Kazimierz Major! As always, it's your old buddy Greatmouth Mob here!

Greatmouth Mob:
After countless hardships and struggles, after countless victories and defeats, Kazimierz will, tonight, crown yet another champion after three long years!

Greatmouth Mob:
Don't expect much sleep in the land of Kazimierz tonight! A new hero and a new legend will be born!

Greatmouth Mob:
Countless eyes are on us from all over the world! Knight enthusiasts from Columbia, Victoria, Leithanien, you name it, all are paying rapt attention to tonight's match!

Greatmouth Mob:
And tonight's match, yes, in a single night, will shatter countless records! The number of concurrent viewers! The total amount of traffic! Single-day sales!

Greatmouth Mob:
––But that's not all! The most, most, most, most important thing of all... are the knights! Take a good look, every single one of you lucky spectators! Tonight, even the Minoan goddess of war will have to concede!

Greatmouth Mob:
For the first time in over two decades, two champions will clash in the grand finals!

Greatmouth Mob:
Two champions! Two of the greatest knights Kazimierz has ever seen!! Anybody lucky enough to be here to witness this historic event—make sure to etch every moment of this night into your memory!

Greatmouth Mob:
Because from now on, you all will be a part of the greatest moment in the history of the Kazimierz Major!

Greatmouth Mob:
The two contenders for the championship require no introduction! But rules are rules, so I've got to waste a few of your precious minutes! First, let me introduce you to––

Greatmouth Mob:
The defending Champion of the Major, 'Kazimierz's Blood-Red Chalice,' the Blood Knight of the Crimson Chalice Knightclub –– DIKAAAAAAIOOOPOLIIIIIIS!

A suit of crimson armor emerges from the shadows and takes its place beneath the light.

The hero has no flashy moves. He simply stands in the arena, feeling the temperature of the soil and the humidity of the air.

The Blood Knight lifts his head slightly. He can hardly see the night sky from beneath the blinding array of light.

The Blood Knight:
......

An Infected Knight:
The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight!

A Spectating Knight:
The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight! The Blood Knight!

Amiya:
The Blood Knight. He is the one who created a path to knighthood for the Infected?

Amiya:
I had no idea... he was this kind of warrior.

Shining:
Just listen to those deafening cheers.

Nightingale:
Shining, he's the one they call their hero?

Greatmouth Mob:
And on the other side!

Greatmouth Mob:
The young legend! The heir of a great hero! Bearer of a thousand glories and former occupant of the Throne of Champions, only to be exiled in the blink of an eye! A tragedy in the hearts of countless people!

Greatmouth Mob:
But none of that matters now! She is the youngest champion in the history of the Major, the quickest to achieve the rank of Grand Knight, an independent knight who rose to the highest honor in the land––

Greatmouth Mob:
The legend on everyone's lips... now walks before us once more! Please welcome the light-bringing pegasus, the Radiant Knight––MAAAARGAREEEEEET NEEEAAAAAAAARRRLLL!!

Margaret:
......

The Blood Knight:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
Two Infected, two champions, two Grand Knights! This match will be one for the history books! A matchup so exciting your heart might leap out of your chest!

Greatmouth Mob:
It's now my pleasure to announce...

Greatmouth Mob:
The deciding Grand Finals of the 24th Kazimierz Major! BEGIN––

Greatmouth Mob:
––NOW!!!

Margaret:
......

The Blood Knight:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
Wh-What's going on?! The Blood Knight suddenly took off his helmet! This usually only happens after the match is decided––!

The Radiant Knight:
You...

The Blood Knight:
The Radiant Knight. I'm very glad you've made it here.

The Radiant Knight:
Thank you.

The Blood Knight:
A lot of people do not understand your choices, but I do.

The Blood Knight:
You wish to become a beacon. You know that you alone cannot tear down this era–– And if you could, it would be meaningless.

The Blood Knight:
Therefore, you cast your own light forth to illuminate a path forward for others, in the hope that those who are forced to kneel will straighten their backs, to let the oppressed choose their own destinies.

Margaret:
......

The Blood Knight:
Your dedication is most honorable, Radiant Knight. From your eyes, I cannot see even a speck of the so-called dust of ideals.

The Blood Knight:
Many heroes do strive to act out of justice, but do it too hastily, in a way that is only self-serving.

Margaret:
No, I was surprised.

Margaret:
After I returned to Kazimierz, I met a number of knights who still held onto their faith.

Margaret:
They haven't lost themselves to modernity. From them, I can still see the embers of glory flickering.

The Blood Knight:
Virtue will always exist. This city is not so rotten to that extent, but––

The Blood Knight:
––Virtue alone cannot change this era.

Margaret:
On this decadent knights' stage, there is only one thing I want to prove.

Margaret:
That even now, true knights still exist.

Margaret:
That beauty, honor, and justice... still exist here––

The Blood Knight:
––Indeed, those things, that spirit, are like gems. You illuminate those gems, and wait for others to pick them up again.

The Blood Knight:
That is your greatest limitation, Margaret.

The Blood Knight:
Dedication, sacrifice, and fighting for justice are of course noble and righteous. For this, I admire you.

The Blood Knight:
But these things, the spirit of knighthood, may not be enough to save this complex era.

Margaret:
......

The Blood Knight:
You handed a pickaxe to the weak and taught them to break down walls of stone. But you never taught them how to build a new home.

The Blood Knight:
Or rather–– You never told them: While they can choose a new path, there are many different paths they can take.

Margaret:
Nngh––!

Greatmouth Mob:
The Blood Knight suddenly launches the first attack! In terms of range, the Radiant Knight's swordspear should undoubtedly have the advantage! But right now–– Wait a minute!

Greatmouth Mob:
It's Blood Arts! After the axe swing, he's immediately following up with a spear of blood from his left hand––?!

Margaret:
—

The Blood Knight:
(She blocked it––?)

The Radiant Knight:
I'm not done yet!

The Blood Knight:
Guh!

Greatmouth Mob:
A burst of light! It's the Radiant Knight's Arts! In the opening moments of the match, it's an Arts against Arts showdown! I can't see what's going on, but the two are clearly already going at it hard!

The Candle Knight:
What precise Arts control, and to throw it out so instantly... Unbelievable.

The Candle Knight:
This couldn't have been achieved through ordinary training... No, there's no way you can learn skills like this from the arena...

The Candle Knight:
Is it military training? Fighting rampaging beasts on the wastelands?

The Candle Knight:
I can say this for sure, Margaret. You now shine like the sun in the sky.

The Blood Knight:
––In every duel you fight... Against the Nightzmora, against the Candle Knight... Are you always this calm?

The Blood Knight:
Look at you. This is the first time I've seen your expression on the battlefield––

The Blood Knight:
You—

Margaret:
My expression?

Margaret:
Much less burdened than I expected, Blood Knight.

The Blood Knight:
......

Margaret:
I've given it some thought as well. If I returned to the arena only to see decadence and decay, whether or not I'd be shaken.

Margaret:
But now, I am firm in my beliefs.

Margaret:
Though we should probably put that conversation aside for another time.

The Blood Knight:
Agreed.

The eyes of the two knights meet.

The power beneath their armor roils restlessly, strong convictions flaring in their hearts.

Now is not the time to talk about the future.

Now is the time to decide a winner.
