'The city is a man-eating behemoth, but still we must dwell in its bowels gratefully.'

Greatmouth Mob:
Welcome to the Kazimierz National Arena! Welcome... to the Kazimierz Major! I am none other than your old friend –– Greatmouth Mob!

Greatmouth Mob:
After a long qualifying stage, this is the moment all of Kazimierz has long been waiting for –– the first match of the Kazimierz Major starts today!

Greatmouth Mob:
Dueling, jousting, and assorted miscellany! Three categories, eight major events, forty-three minor events! Countless knights and knightclubs will take their share of gold and glory!

An Audience Knight:
How did Mob end up as the MC? Think he greased some palms behind the scenes?

A Popcorn-Clutching Knight:
Like he bribed his way in? How much do you think something like that would cost?

An Audience Knight:
Mob's never been the type to keep his mouth shut. What if he let something slip, right here on the big stage?

A Popcorn-Clutching Knight:
Hah. You hear about that loudmouth, the Bearded Cage? Heard he 'badmouthed' a pretty big deal of a knight during the Major...

A Popcorn-Clutching Knight:
...and that was the last anyone saw of 'im. Want some popcorn?

An Audience Knight:
Pssht. Probably just took the fall and resigned. A by-the-book trick.

A Popcorn-Clutching Knight:
*munch* I shed... dish-appeared... *munch*... not resigned. You get it?

An Audience Knight:
Huh... No shittin'?

Greatmouth Mob:
Today's Major features eight big knightclubs, sixty-four of the normal ones, and two unaffiliated, independent knights!

Greatmouth Mob:
The Kazimierz Major is a showcase of the beauty and majesty of our knights for all of Terra to enjoy!

Greatmouth Mob:
Our first match will pit the Bladehelm Knightclub against the Cloudhaze Knightclub! How many points will the ten knights from each side take home to their clubs?!

Greatmouth Mob:
A big prize pool is getting bigger as I speak! A portion of everything you spend at this arena will be added to the tournament prize for the knights to fight over!

Greatmouth Mob:
Which knightclub will take the most trophies? Which knight will stand above the rest and become this Major's Knight-Champion?

Greatmouth Mob:
Now... LET US SEE FOR OURSELVES––!

The Grand Knight Territory Kawalerielki, Wall of Champions

Spokesman McKee:
How's the fit, Mr. Malkiewicz?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Good, thanks to you.

Spokesman McKee:
That's enough of that. Custom-tailored formalwear is a must for maintaining our image.

Spokesman McKee:
Do you still have the tailor's contact information? I believe you'll find his services most helpful.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman McKee:
Sir, could you please get me a glass of wine? Thank you.

Spokesman McKee:
What's on your mind?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Nothing in particular...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Maybe... This banquet is just too much for me.

Spokesman McKee:
Ah, 'maybe.'

Spokesman McKee:
Maybe you haven't gotten over the incident with Mr. Czarny. Quite the shame, for all of us.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......!

Spokesman McKee:
He was a conscientious one, who always put his best foot forward, whether as a company employee or as a spokesman for the K.G.C.C.

Spokesman McKee:
In fact, I only met him after becoming a spokesman myself. In terms of our work in the Majors, he was far senior to a fresh face like me.

Spokesman McKee:
He always treated those he respected well, yes?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Maybe...

Spokesman McKee:
Let's do away with these maybes, and lift our spirits instead.

Spokesman McKee:
Today is but the second day of the opening ceremonies, and a great day to open the Wall of Champions to the outside world. It would hardly fit the occasion for the resident manager to wear such a dour expression.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Yes, you're right... Sorry...

Spokesman McKee:
You should speak up more, Malkiewicz. And there's no need to be so stiff around me. It's certainly not conducive to our working relationship.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
What was that? Did something happen outside?

Spokesman McKee:
Hmm.

Spokesman McKee:
I believe it's a guest of honor, a very important knight. Let me check the time... See, look how punctual she is. We need more knights like her.

Spokesman McKee:
Pardon me, I'll be right back. In the meanwhile, do avail yourself of your right to the open bar.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
S-Sure...

Spokesman McKee:
The sweet release of libation is wonderful indeed. You ought to indulge in it.

Spokesman McKee:
Madam Droste, we meet again.

Droste:
Good evening. Am I late?

Spokesman McKee:
Not at all. I'm glad you could make it.

Spokesman McKee:
I do believe the glow of the Candle Knight will add a beautiful touch to tonight's opening banquet.

The Grand Knight Territory Kawalerielki – General Chamber of Commerce, Reception Room

Platinum:
......

Platinum:
............

Platinum:
I—

???:
Ah, no need to explain yourself, Platinum. We didn't expect this to happen either... Just doing your job, of course?

???:
You do what you have to do.

Platinum:
......

Platinum:
I screwed up.

???:
Ah yes, a screwup... But we aren't exactly nine-to-five office drones here. In our line of work, 'screwups' are very serious.

???:
Deadly serious, even.

Platinum:
......

???:
Luckily this time, you only let the Radiant Knight barge into the Infected quarter... Oh, but that did throw a wrench into Monique's work.

???:
Her job was to make a little fireworks show out of those illegal settlements, and then bring the Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub to Area 0.

???:
It was going so smoothly, but suddenly... from the slaughter came the Radiant Knight, and there went all our plans.

???:
She's very unhappy now, you understand? We all know her temper, and if someone was to get in the way of her bounty, you know how troublesome that'd be.

Platinum:
I didn't know what Monique was doing.

???:
No, you did know. Besides, whether you knew or not is no excuse.

???:
After all, your job was to 'track the Infected.' Did I not say a long time ago that our jobs would be changing?

Platinum:
......

???:
Now now, what's with that icy expression? Oh, were you perhaps born with that face, little pegasus?

Platinum:
......

???:
How seriously can I take someone who submits seventeen or eighteen time-off requests a month? ...Ah, forget it.

???:
Count your lucky stars that the whole thing about the Radiant Knight rushing into an Infected quarters to fight off a group of mysterious assassins didn't make headlines in the major news outlets.

???:
Though the media are still our valued partners, suppressing these kinds of things costs a lot of money. And let me tell you, they don't pass up on these juicy opportunities.

Platinum:
...I'll accept responsibility for these losses.

???:
Your self-awareness is commendable, but you can't afford to 'accept responsibility' for many more mistakes. After all, the Board of Directors only pays you so much, yes?

Platinum:
Sorry.

???:
Hah. Enough of that. Playing the villain isn't exactly my strong suit.

???:
We're still work partners, right?

Platinum:
If you think so, then so it must be, Lord Roy.

Roy:
Tisk tisk. When you call me that, doesn't it seem like we're strangers? 'Platinum' Centaurea... See, doesn't hearing that make you feel uncomfortable? Why don't we go with a nickname instead, my little pegasus?

Platinum:
Kazimierz has many pegasi.

Roy:
It's fine as long as you know I'm referring to you... Oh, right. There's just one more thing, though it's not a very big deal.

Platinum:
If you're talking about it, there's no way I can treat it as anything less than a big deal.

Roy:
Then it appears that you misunderstand me. I'm willing to talk to you about all sorts of things, from small talk to important matters... Haha.

Roy:
Mm. I heard you spared the life of Szewczyk's runt?

Platinum:
Czarny was already removed from his post at that time. I wasn't in the mood to listen to him and kill a kid.

Roy:
Ah, so frank. That's fine.

Roy:
Though I also feel bad for Czarny, that isn't the real issue here... Put simply, Szewczyk has gone missing.

Roy:
Plastic Knight does not come from an esteemed lineage. He's just another tournament upstart.

Roy:
Though we didn't have any plans to remove him from the picture, he is the property of the Roar Guards Co., and it never bodes well to let someone else take the initiative. We'll definitely get complaints from the K.G.C.C.

Platinum:
Did you find out who did it?

Roy:
The Infected.

Platinum:
I don't understand. How could a few Infected knights accomplish all this?

Roy:
Who knows, little Platinum? That's exactly what we're trying to figure out right now.

Roy:
But there's one thing you shouldn't misunderstand.

Platinum:
Oh do please illuminate me.

Roy:
What we face... is not just a few meager Infected, but rather all the Infected of Kawalerielki.

Roy:
Mieszko Industries just delivered eight new plates. The purpose of the plate called Area 0 will soon be brought to light.

Roy:
I've mentioned this before, right? We're going to be real busy.

Platinum:
I understand.

Roy:
Good, as long as you understand. *cough* *cough* Hmm...

Platinum:
......

Roy:
*hiss*... It's too damn hot today, don't you think? How nice it must be to not have to wear a helm...

Platinum:
.......?

Roy:
Hm, you can't see what's different about me?

Platinum:
Oh.

Platinum:
You dyed your hair?

Roy:
Everything, including my tail. What do you think? Looks good, huh?

Platinum:
Yes, it suits you well.

Roy:
What's the meaning of that annoyed look in your eyes?

Platinum:
Don't think I have to answer personal questions, do I?

Roy:
But you see, you hold the title of 'Platinum.' White hair, clad in pure white. Monique is Victorian, natural blue hair, lazurite attire. An absolutely perfect fit.

Roy:
But look at me, all dark and drab. Standing next to Monique, I'm so out of place, like I'm a janitor or something.

Roy:
So out of consideration for our public image, I also decided on a color for myself, heh.

Platinum:
...You...

Roy:
Hm?

Platinum:
As long as you're happy.

The Grand Knight Territory Kawalerielki – Urban Crevices, Infected Gathering

Sona:
I'm back!

Justyna:
Took you a while, Sona.

Sona:
Rude. Some stuff happened along the way.

Justyna:
......

Justyna:
Ashlock's mentioned it before. Back then, during that 'Industrial Incident,' was it the Radiant Knight that helped you?

Sona:
Ahaha... Is this the celebrity effect? Feels like everyone already knows...

Justyna:
She...

Justyna:
What kind of person is she?

Sona:
Oh, that's adorable. I thought you weren't interested in gossip.

Justyna:
My hometown...

Justyna:
Back home, there's an arena.

Justyna:
There were never any tournaments in that small arena. It was just built because that's what you do, you have an arena in a town.

Justyna:
But back then... was when I started to look up to the knights. It was also where I grew up hearing legends of the Radiant Knight.

Justyna:
It's been many years.

Sona:
Really? You never mentioned that before.

Justyna:
And when did you tell me about what you were like as a kid?

Sona:
Fair. Maybe that is something we should talk about later.

Justyna:
It was a long road.

Justyna:
The road to the Grand Knight Territory was so very long. I didn't come all the way here to reminisce about my old home.

Sona:
We're just chatting, alright? No need to be so uptight.

Justyna:
Just chatting, huh...

Justyna:
When the day comes that we can sit around a patisserie with nothing to fear, we can grab Ashlock and Wild Mane and chat the afternoon away.

Sona:
Good idea.

Justyna:
So... What kind of person is she?

Sona:
Well... To be honest, ermm, we only made eye contact. I have no idea if she even saw my face, busy as we were.

Justyna:
......

Sona:
H-Hey, don't look so down! It's not like I could just strike it up with the champion in front of the Armorless assassins.

Sona:
But, she still rescued an Infected like me, even with eyes on her.

Justyna:
Hmm...

Justyna:
Maybe she really is the Radiant Knight. The very same... as the Infected dream about.

Sona:
The what now–– Eh, whatever. How about the poor guy you rescued? The old one?

Justyna:
He...

???:
You asking about me?

Plastic Knight:
My arrow's nocked, Infected.

Plastic Knight:
You'll help me make those lowlife assassins pay the price.

An Aged Knight:
Amiya, and the Doctor of Rhodes Island, please come in. Treat this place as your own home.

An Aged Knight:
Your rooms are upstairs. The doctors are working up on the twelfth floor.

Amiya:
Thank you, kind sir.

An Aged Knight:
Haha... There's no need to be so formal, Miss Amiya.

An Aged Knight:
I never expected the leader of Rhodes Island to be such a lovely, young Cautus girl. Ah, to be young and full of promise.

Amiya:
Th-There's nothing special about me...

Amiya:
D-Doctor...

An Aged Knight:
Haha, are you embarrassed?

An Aged Knight:
What an adorable girl. If I had a granddaughter, I reckon she'd be about your age.

Amiya:
Oh...

An Aged Knight:
My my, her face is beet red.

An Aged Knight:
But, I must apologize. Considering your unique status, I can't arrange an in-person meeting for you two.

Amiya:
Mhm... Don't worry, that's perfectly understandable.

An Aged Knight:
So... 'Gravel.'

Senomy:
Your orders.

An Aged Knight:
This young lady here is a fourth-order campaign knight. You can call her 'Gravel.' She's very promising.

Gravel:
Hello.

An Aged Knight:
She will personally take charge of your safety while you are in Kawalerielki. Should you need anything, just let her know, and she will be of service.

An Aged Knight:
We cannot allow any misfortune to befall our distinguished guests from abroad, not to mention such excellent partners as yourselves, during the Major.

Amiya:
We understand, sir.

An Aged Knight:
Thank you for your understanding. I've prattled on for long enough, so I'll leave you young people to your business.

An Aged Knight:
Gravel, please take good care of the Rhodes Islanders.

Gravel:
As you wish.

Gravel:
Now then... I'll be standing outside the door. If something comes up, just call for me.

Amiya:
Right, okay. Thanks, Gravel.

Gravel:
......

Gravel:
There is one thing... Do you mind if I come a little closer? Yes, just like this, good.

Gravel:
......Mmwah.

Amiya:
—?!

Gravel:
Hm? What's wrong? Your face is beet red. That's just how I say hello, so don't think too much about it.

Gravel:
Anyway, I'm Gravel, a knight of Kazimierz. It's a pleasure. Hehehe.

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
What... What was that all about...?

Amiya:
Err, umm... I have heard that sometimes nobles will indeed greet each other with a kiss... And, umm, seeing as how she's a knight...

Amiya:
That's probably all she meant with it, right? Probably...

Amiya:
...Haah...

Amiya:
Yeah... I guess I have been a bit nervous.

Amiya:
But, that old lady seemed a lot more easygoing than the other Adeptus knights we met earlier.

Amiya:
How about you, Doctor? Are you tired?

Amiya:
Of course you are. We've been tied up with business and all kinds of formalities since we got to Kazimierz.

Amiya:
At least you can catch your breath now.

Amiya:
Ahaha.... Doctor, were you able to take a breather as well?

Amiya:
It would be nice if all the people in charge of the medical mission were as reasonable as that old lady.

Amiya:
But, this is a rare opportunity for us.

Amiya:
It's said that every few years, the Grand Knight Territory will select a few of the most rapidly developing cities to merge with its own core city.

Amiya:
It's a remarkable feat, if you think about it.

Amiya:
Mm... It's been a bit of a shock for me as well.

Amiya:
Even though... I've always heard Nearl talk about her homeland, I never expected the heart of Kazimierz to be like this.

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
Hwuh? Ah, um, n-not really... I just don't get to visit big cities like this very often.

Amiya:
After all, how many Infected get to look out over a thriving city from atop a high-rise hotel...

Amiya:
If Rhodes Island didn't manage to secure a medical business contract, we'd never get to enjoy this luxury.

Amiya:
The only thing is...

Amiya:
I can't stop wondering about Nearl... and how she's doing right now.

Amiya:
Mhm...

Amiya:
Ultimately, we should trust her. This is her decision to make.

Amiya:
I just hope she's safe and sound...

Amiya:
But, since Shining and Nightingale are with her, she'll be fine, right?

Amiya:
Yup! Let's put our faith in Nearl.

Amiya:
After all, she is the Radiant Knight—a pinnacle of Kazimierz knighthood, right?

Amiya:
Oh, Doctor! Quick, look at that big screen outside!

Amiya:
Is that... Nearl?

Maria:
Margaret, I'm done!

Maria:
Based on the suggestions you made last time, I adjusted the center of mass and added a retracting function. Now, it should be able to...

Maria:
...Margaret?

Margaret:
......

Maria:
What's on your mind?

Margaret:
Oh, Maria... Sorry, what were you talking about?

Maria:
You don't usually space out like that. What's wrong?

Margaret:
I heard some of the rumors while I was at Rhodes Island...

Margaret:
But this place... really has changed a whole lot.

Maria:
Yeah... We've sold off a lot of the furniture.

Maria:
You know Uncle. Were it not for him, we might've moved somewhere else last year.

Maria:
Yesterday, someone from the Knights Association came by again to harass us. Both you and I, we're always representing some knightclub, or the family. Otherwise...

Margaret:
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

Maria:
Hehe, now that's how a big sister should be.

Maria:
Oh, right, here's your weapon. Master Kowal and I tuned it up for you.

Maria:
But, you haven't had any matches lately, right? How'd it get worn out so badly? It's like a bomb went off next to it.

Margaret:
I never realized it before. The sheer number of Infected living in the Grand Knight Territory.

Maria:
...Margaret?

Margaret gazes wordlessly at the skyscrapers in the distance.

She can't forget the dark, garbage-choked underground, or the flickering glow of flames.

Margaret:
Now, the Infected can become knights. The Blood Knight did something incredible. Judging by the results, he saved many Infected from misfortune.

Margaret:
But, this is not what a 'knight' should be. The Infected should not be callously treated as playthings just because they suffer from a disease.

Maria:
......

Maria:
Sona... might've just wanted to help those Infected as well.

Maria:
The factory is running, the mines haven't stopped. The city is still developing, and more and more Infected will end up at the bottom.

Maria:
They were all going to be exiled into the wilderness... but Pinus Sylvestris paid for them. Bought all those Infected with no home of their own.

Maria:
That's what Master Kowal told me.

Margaret:
Except, that doesn't change anything. They still don't have a place in this city.

Maria:
Right... some Infected knights have done similar things before, but there's a limit to how many of the Infected poor the General Chamber of Commerce will allow to hide in the city.

Margaret:
...and the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi Kazimierz will?

Margaret:
The ruling class is even more reluctant to watch the Infected walk openly in their city, and they'll also take measures.

Maria:
All the news talks about lately is the Infected, and Oripathy research conferences...

Margaret:
They're whipping up hysteria.

Margaret:
They media's trying to make ordinary people fear the Infected, even if it threatens to undo the stabilizing effect that the Infected Knights Act has had––

Margaret:
––and the scary part is, this kind of rhetoric from the media... almost always succeeds.

Młynar:
......

???:
Don't always look so glum. No money falls into the pockets of the despondent.

???:
The Radiant Knight is answering a higher calling, helping out the Infected hidden throughout the dark alleys of the city. How noble––

Młynar:
And then what?

Młynar:
Can she give them their lives back? Can she treat their Oripathy? Can she help the Infected fight back against the rest of society?

???:
Who knows? Maybe she can.

Młynar:
Cut the crap, Toland.

Młynar:
Do you have nothing better to do? Why don't you leave the Grand Knight Territory and crawl back to your den of thieves?

Toland:
Now that the two sisters are safe and sound, there's no more room for me here?

Młynar:
You've already been paid back.

Toland:
That little bit of cash was just a formality. You know exactly the currency we deal in, Master Młynar.

Młynar:
Who gave you permission to come in?

Toland:
Mmhmm, this carpet isn't half bad.. The Leithanian textiles are being auctioned off tomorrow, yes?

Młynar:
That's none of your concern.

Toland:
The origins of those two Sarkaz knights certainly raise eyebrows. As a Sarkaz myself, I do pity the fate of those 'knights.'

Toland:
But I must remind you, this is no longer part of our business arrangement. My work here was done long ago.

Toland:
I had my own reasons for coming to Kawalerielki, since it's not something I do often. I wanted to see if we could come to a mutual understanding–– but it seems that isn't possible.

Młynar:
......

Toland:
Now now, don't make that face. Our relationship is already much better than it was before, Your Excellency.

Toland:
After all, I'm just a no-name bounty hunter. To the Grand Knight Territory, I'm nothing at all. As for you–– Oh my, haha. Sorry.

Toland:
It would seem that you're nothing as well. I guess that makes us two peas in the same sickly pod.

Młynar:
......

Młynar:
