An Infected Knight:
Hyaaargh!

A Competing Knight:
Damn you, Infected—with the nerve to—

An Infected Knight:
Go on, leave. You don't deserve to be here.

A Competing Knight:
Peh! I'll drag you out of the scoring pen at the least!

An Infected Knight:
—! Ugh!

An Infected Knight:
That's fine, I've still got my points—

Brassrust Knight:
Is that right? Oripathic filth?

An Infected Knight:
Ungh?!

Iwona:
Tch, Ingra...

An Excited Spectator:
That's it! Brassrust! Keep it up! Get him out of the scoring pen!

An Excited Spectator:
Break his hand! Keep going! Don't let that Infected get away!

A Sensible Spectator:
Shh! Keep it down! Look at the seats over there...

An Excited Spectator:
Huh? Why's she all alone there...? 'Infected Knight seating?'

Iwona:
......

A Sensible Spectator:
Not too loud. She was looking this way earlier.

An Excited Spectator:
Hah, aren't there divider walls between the seats? She can't hear anything, right? Besides, you think an Infected would have the guts to climb over here to get at me?

An Infected Knight:
This is a knight's swordsmanship, Ingra. All that blunt movement of yours really is unwatchable.

Brassrust Knight:
*Spit*... Infected refuse... daring to lecture me? Wait until I've flayed you and pulled your bones apart... then you'll regret it.

An Infected Knight:
(He really is no brains, all brawn. I just need to wait while he loses his cool.)

An Infected Knight:
(Oh, here it comes!)

Brassrust Knight:
Goddamned Infected trash—

An Infected Knight:
—Trash? Why do I feel like it's you knights, resting on your laurels, who can't stand the heat?

Brassrust Knight:
Grgh! He can push me off?!

Brassrust Knight:
No, your tiny little playsword could never... is it Arts technique? Wind Arts? Or just pure driving strength?

An Infected Knight:
Would I ever tell you? Olmer Ingra.

Brassrust Knight:
You—take this!!

An Infected Knight:
(Wait, what—?!)

Brassrust Knight:
Tch, it really was wind.

Brassrust Knight:
It seems it's only good enough to bolster your movements. Far short of what deranged things the Wind Knight can pull.

An Infected Knight:
(Analysis? So he isn't just a simple-minded moron...)

Brassrust Knight:
Hmph, Infected. That sword of yours has no Arts unit, yet still cast... disgusting. The Arts given to you by the Originium in your organs will not change the outcome of this.

Brassrust Knight:
That rotten Blood Knight is the same. Just because some Infected knights have cobbled together a false renown, he forces the common folk to recognize the Infected?

Brassrust Knight:
The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi have been just too kind to you all. Know how grateful you should be, Oripathic filth.

An Infected Knight:
Grateful?

An Infected Knight:
To you lot?

Brassrust Knight:
Hah, such attitude? The Infected crawling and struggling along Kazimierz's lowest layers, you genuinely dare to cast contempt on the knight nobles?

An Infected Knight:
Do you know the price the Infected pay for our legal emancipation?

Brassrust Knight:
Hah, why should I know? I only know your coming death will be wretched—

An Infected Knight:
Do you know how brutal a female gloompincer is when it's been snatched from its egg? Do you know, when Infected knights are selected... the tacit homicide that happens?

An Infected Knight:
Oh, 'your coming death will be wretched.' Big words, Olmer Ingra. You just relish in bullying the weak. It's a miracle you have the guts to step into a deathmatch.

An Infected Knight:
—Have you seen what happens to all the lives deemed cheap? You knight noble filth?

An Excited Spectator:
There's only five still standing their ground in the scoring pen?!

An Excited Spectator:
Kurde! I spent all my savings on this bet, and that idiot doesn't even touch the pen for half an hour?

A Rowdy Spectator:
Why's there still an Infected? Are they fighting 'Brassrust' Ingra?!

An Excited Spectator:
Hey! Get rid of that filthy asshole! Ingra!

An Excited Spectator:
Ingra! Ingra! Ingra!

An Excited Spectator:
Wh-What was that? An earthquake?

A Rowdy Spectator:
No, no, it's that Infected knight over there... she stomped the ground something fierce just now...

Iwona:
...Tch.

Iwona:
These dumbasses... starting to gang up on the Infected, huh.

An Infected Knight:
How's that?! Are you hurting now, Ingra?!

An Infected Knight:
Wha... am I being surrounded?

Brassrust Knight:
...Infected...

Brassrust Knight:
You have no right to be here.

An Infected Knight:
Ugh—?!

A Staid Knight:
Forfeit, Infected.

A Staid Knight:
I don't like how Ingra does things, but neither my Knightclub nor my family would stand for the humiliation of an Infected sharing the podium.

An Infected Knight:
You... love a good excuse, don't you...

A Staid Knight:
Don't get me wrong. Only one can stand in the scoring pen in the end.

A Staid Knight:
This is a brawl, Infected, but right now, you've made yourself the prime target.

An Infected Knight:
...Feh.

Brassrust Knight:
Heedless wretches... once I dispose of this Infected, you're all next.

An Ingratiating Knight:
Sir Ingra... I'm wounded and would be hard-pressed to vie for the title, but at least for the moment, we should work together to topple that Infected slave.

An Ingratiating Knight:
These depraved Infected with the gall to talk their tripe at knights. You all know of the disturbance the Infected caused before, don't you?

An Ingratiating Knight:
Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub always was a suspicious lot. Rumor has it they orchestrate the illegal Infected congregations.

An Ingratiating Knight:
Exploiting the riches from winning alongside us to harm the safety of Kawalerielki, and even Kazimierz in whole? Should we be indulging such action?

An Infected Knight:
...Illegal Infected?

An Infected Knight:
All I saw was a tragedy of people without a home! A tragedy of people dumped out of the factories, the farms and the beast ranches!!

Brassrust Knight:
Less of the row, Infected.

Brassrust Knight:
If that's how you truly see it, you ought to go on your merry way back to the Infected shelters. No need to stay here, overwhelmed as you are.

Brassrust Knight:
Let's be brutally honest. You ache to put every knight to death, don't you? You're welling with rage, gasping for vengeance, aren't you?

Brassrust Knight:
Then what are you waiting for?

An Infected Knight:
—You!

An Infected Knight:
Ghakh—hah, hah—

Brassrust Knight:
Cur! I'll cleave your hand off and slap you awake with it!

An Infected Knight:
(No, I can't stay any longer in this fight, I need to—)

A Staid Knight:
......

An Ingratiating Knight:
Not today.

An Infected Knight:
You lot... Get out of my—

An Infected Knight:
Ungh?!

An Infected Knight:
Dammit... What are you people doing?!

An Ingratiating Knight:
Naught but standing here.

A Staid Knight:
......

Brassrust Knight:
You have nowhere to run this time!

An Infected Knight:
Gargh...!

Brassrust Knight:
Oh-ho, your armor's up to snuff. That blow should've cleaved your spine in twain.

An Infected Knight:
Gakgh... gakgh... *cough*, *cough* *cough*...

An Ingratiating Knight:
I don't understand why the Knights Association would allow your lot into the Major. Isn't your blood a deadly toxin?

A Staid Knight:
Enough.

A Staid Knight:
Infected, get out of here. Just give up.

A Staid Knight:
You've already been gravely wounded. Any more, and you'll never win another match.

An Infected Knight:
—Shut up!

An Infected Knight:
You... you people... sanctimonious thugs...!

An Infected Knight:
Ugh?!

Brassrust Knight:
Sanctimonious. Is that what you think of me?

Brassrust Knight:
We'll see how long you can keep up the sniveling little traitor act. You'll be kneeling, begging for forgiveness...

Iwona:
—!

Iwona:
Hey, where are the judges? What the hell is this?!

Iwona:
Are these knights gonna just rig up their own shitshow right here?!

Iwona:
I—

Iwona:
—

An Excited Spectator:
Ingra! Ingra! Ingra!

An Excited Spectator:
Long live Brassrust! Long live Kazimierz! Long live the knights!

Iwona:
......

A Rowdy Spectator:
Get that Infected up! Make him get up!

A Rowdy Spectator:
Get him on his feet! Keep him fighting!! Let's see how tough he really is!!

Iwona:
...*Hiss*!

An Excited Spectator:
What? What the? St... Stay away from me, alright??

Iwona:
What say I toss you down there? Get you closer to the action? Huh?

An Excited Spectator:
Wait.. you...

An Excited Spectator:
What are you doing?! You're a KNIGHT and you're gonna assault the audience?

Iwona:
...What...

A Rowdy Spectator:
Where's security?! Security! There's an Infected assaulting civilians!!

Iwona:
You sonnovabitch!

An Infected Knight:
Gagh...

An Infected Knight:
Y... You...

Brassrust Knight:
Still have strength in you?

An Infected Knight:
Guh—ulgh... blugh...

A Staid Knight:
That's close enough, Brassrust, he's liable to die.

A Staid Knight:
He might be Infected, but still a registered knight. We don't need the National Council pestering us over an Infected.

Brassrust Knight:
Tch! What are you gesturing at me for?! Huh? Who do you think you are?

A Staid Knight:
One of us has to lose, Brassrust. There's only one victor in this match.

Brassrust Knight:
Exactly what I—

Brassrust Knight:
What is this? Wind? You still intend to resist?

An Infected Knight:
...You...

Brassrust Knight:
Hah. You know, an electric fan destined for junk blows more of a breeze than you do, Infected. What's the matter?

An Infected Knight:
...You'll... regret this...

Brassrust Knight:
Hoh...

An Ingratiating Knight:
Has he a death wish?!

A Staid Knight:
The wind's—picked up? He's still got strength?

A Staid Knight:
Ngh—

An Infected Knight:
You!

An Infected Knight:
All of you...

An Excited Spectator:
Hey, hey, look at the Infected!

An Excited Spectator:
What's he doing?! Is he casting Arts?

Iwona:
You—

Iwona:
—Arts? No! He can't keep this up—

An Infected Knight:
Ingra... and the rest of you!

An Infected Knight:
None of you have the first idea what the Infected have to go through... Did we get Oripathy because we wanted it?!

An Infected Knight:
Families abandon us. Fellow soldiers abandon us. You people throw us into the beast arenas like trash, to bleed alongside starving gloompincers.

An Infected Knight:
I'll have you—

I'll die here.

Right. This is an arena. A Major arena. But in the end, it was only ever built to hold greater and greater show tournaments.

No.

No matter where it is... what does it matter when an Infected 'has an accident?'

Don't resist, and I really will be beaten, wide awake, to death.

That's right.

I need to resist.

There's nothing left but to resist.

An Infected Knight:
I'll make you... pay in blood...!

A Staid Knight:
Ugh, the wind's getting stronger...

An Ingratiating Knight:
Hmph. If I hang around here, come soon enough, I won't be beating any of you. My Knightclub superiors will understand.

An Ingratiating Knight:
I was thinking I'd win by playing the bystander. If there's no chance, I'm out, I'm out! You deal with this yourselves!

A Staid Knight:
Infected can cast without an Arts Unit. That's unfair.

A Staid Knight:
I'll be reporting to Northwood Knight Order, Infected have to be constrained... We should withdraw for now, Brassrust.

Brassrust Knight:
......

A Staid Knight:
Brassrust?

Brassrust Knight:
Not a sound... He wants to kill me, waste his very life on these Arts so he can humiliate me...

An Infected Knight:
No! You can't run!

Brassrust Knight:
Hah! Why would I ever run?

Brassrust Knight:
I'll tear your miserable Arts and that face of yours into pieces, and dance with your blood under my boots—!

Brassrust Knight:
Come! Unmentionable Infected!

An Infected Knight:
I'll... do you in.. I'll...

Oh.

When we divorced, was she the one who got the photo album?

Shame. I won't get to see my precious—

An Excited Spectator:
......

Iwona:
......

An Excited Spectator:
Wha—What happened, right at the end there? Did the wind stop?

An Excited Spectator:
Then...

An Excited Spectator:
Then Brassrust's hatchet... it...

Iwona:
No! Shit!

Brassrust Knight:
*pant*... *pant*... Such a floundering outburst, and where did it get you?

Brassrust Knight:
What's the matter, Infected?! Spent at the last moment?!

Brassrust Knight:
You mockeries of—

Brassrust Knight:
—

Brassrust Knight:
Hold on... is he...

Brassrust Knight:
Dead?

An Ingratiating Knight:
The Infected... died?

An Ingratiating Knight:
But––

A Staid Knight:
Get the medics here! Now! This is an arena! An infection on this scale—

A Staid Knight:
Brassrust! Get away from him!

Brassrust Knight:
He died...?

Brassrust Knight:
Hahah, hahahah... he tried casting that piffling burst of Arts, and died?!

Brassrust Knight:
This is why you Infected all—

A Security Officer:
Please vacate the arena, Brassrust Knight, sir.

A Security Officer:
The medics are stepping in. When we're sure there's no risk of contagion, we'll transport him in a sealed container.

Brassrust Knight:
...Tch.

Brassrust Knight:
—?!

Iwona:
—

Brassrust Knight:
Pinus Sylvestris—! Do you want every knight here your enemy?! Well?!

Iwona:
—Put him down!

A Security Officer:
We're taking these precautions for the safety of the rest of the knights as well as the audience. Please comply.

A Security Officer:
Brassrust, sir, please make your way out.

Brassrust Knight:
Hmph, filthy knight... I certainly don't want my life ruined by Oripathy...

A Security Officer:
Are you Infected too? Please calm down, this is a Major...

An Infected Knight:
Ugh...

Iwona:
Can't you see he's still got life in him?! Move!

Iwona:
Now!

A Staid Knight:
Steady. Are you looking to provoke the Knights Association?

A Staid Knight:
Leave this to the medical personnel—

An Infected Knight:
*cough*! *cough* *cough* *cough*—!

An Infected Knight:
*gasp*...

Iwona:
Let me over!

A Security Officer:
Leave her be... she's Infected too. Get the audience evacuated first.

Iwona:
Are you alright?

An Infected Knight:
Heh... not exactly...

An Infected Knight:
Blood loss... least of my problems...

An Infected Knight:
Aches in my infected spots... they're spreading... hurts...

A Voice on the PA:
Dear visitors: there has been an incident in the arena. We ask that you follow staff instructions for a prompt evacuation. The award ceremony will be postponed by two hours.

A Voice on the PA:
We repeat—dear visitors...

An Infected Knight:
Wild Mane.

Iwona:
Go on.

An Infected Knight:
...Please... you have to...

Iwona:
Sona'll find your wife and girl.

Iwona:
Don't worry.

A Security Officer:
Look! The Originium is spreading across him! We can't wait any longer, put him in the container now!

Iwona:
What are you doing?!

A Security Officer:
Preventing infection.

An Infected Knight:
...You... damned...

An Infected Knight:
Iwona!

An Infected Knight:
Remember their faces!

An Infected Knight:
Remember... These knights... These Kazimierzians... These cold-blooded murderers...

An Infected Knight:
Don't let them get away with it!

Old Craftsman:
It's your turn. Deal already.

Old Knight:
What's your rush? Just let me think.

Old Craftsman:
What've you got to think about with this few cards left?

A Voice on the Television:
We now report on an urgent news story—

A Voice on the Television:
An accident occurred at a capture the flag event held today as part of the Major Show Tournament—

A Voice on the Television:
—an Infected knight concealed his condition before the competition and sustained heavy injuries during the match, all while forcing Originium Arts—

A Voice on the Television:
—went into shock partway through the event, and passed away after aid proved ineffective—

Old Knight:
...Infected...

Old Craftsman:
Passed away? Died? Died on the field?

A Voice on the Television:
According to reports, medical personnel on the scene have finished cleanup of the field, and the arena will return to normal use tomorrow following decontamination.

A Voice on the Television:
With only three hours since the incident, the National Council have already received mass complaints, and look to revise the Infected Knights Act—

Old Knight:
Revise the act? Pull the other one, they're just petrified of owning up!

Old Craftsman:
When the Blood Knight came about, they were pressured to recognize Infected as legitimate. If they fiddle with the laws now, how are they going to save their reputation?

Old Knight:
The question of the Infected's no child's game... you think 'reputation' could affect their policymaking?

Bald Marcin:
Was the knight nobles' 'reputation' ever any worse? Decades ago?

Bald Marcin:
Times are different. I can't say I know what they're thinking now, but no matter whereabouts, enforcing the rules takes priority over any objective results.

Bald Marcin:
We've all suffered for it.

A Voice on the Television:
Cleanup has been completed. All knights who took part will be given a medical examination within the next three days—

A Voice on the PA:
With regard to this incident, the Knights Association is paying a correspondingly high amount of attention.

A Voice on the PA:
Currently, several Knightclubs have cosigned a statement to the Association on the accidental deaths of Infected, uncontrollable Originium Arts, as well as the risk of large-scale infection breaking out during the Major...

Margaret:
Haah—!

Margaret:
No problems, Maria.

Margaret:
Your adjustments to the weapon core are perfect. It's been a long while now since I've wielded something so effortlessly smooth.

Maria:
Ah... mm-hm!

Maria:
I made them especially based on your past fights after all, heheh.

Margaret:
I will.

Zofia:
If we're done with all the theory, we'll want a little practical combat to try things out.

Zofia:
Maria, keep to one side.

Maria:
Ah... okay!

Maria:
You take it easy now, both of you!

Margaret:
I will.

Zofia:
My, that's a good look in your eyes, Margaret.

Zofia:
This is for real now. If you throw, my self-respect will be very sore for it.

Margaret:
Of course.

Margaret:
Now, then—

A Voice on the PA:
—Accordingly, we have invited numerous experts on knight competition to publish their own views. We now go to the Knights Association Officer-in-Charge.

A Voice on the PA:
Ah. Good morning, people of Kazimierz—

Maria:
......

A Voice on the PA:
—Infected can cast without an Arts Unit; this is known to medical science—

A Voice on the PA:
But in the arena, such an ability is 'exceedingly unfair'—

Maria:
(Fairness.)

Maria:
Fairness, huh.

Młynar:
And surmounting the rulesetters within their own rules? Lunatic ravings.

Maria:
......

Zofia:
Ugh...!

Margaret:
Careful.

Margaret:
Are you alright?

Zofia:
Oof... I—I'm fine, now let go...

Margaret:
I'm sorry, it's been a while since I used a weapon with a handle this long. I'm still not quite perfect at exercising it.

Zofia:
*Sigh*...

Zofia:
—Ma-ri-a? What are you laughing at?

Maria:
Eh? Ah, I'm sorry, sorry.

Zofia:
Margaret.

Zofia:
You really have changed.

Margaret:
Hm? Have I?

Zofia:
I don't mean your appearance. Your hair's all messy now. Come here, I'll comb it straight for you.

Zofia:
Maria, bring the comb over. It's behind your worktable.

Maria:
Ah, okay.

Zofia:
Let's sit and take a moment to breathe.

Margaret:
Alright. Thank you.

Zofia:
Honestly... it feels like it's only been the blink of an eye since you left.

Zofia:
(The blink of an eye... and you'll be even farther away from us.)

A Voice on the PA:
—According to reports, the deceased Infected appeared to be implicated in the illegal Infected incident. The relevant circumstances are still under investigation.

A Voice on the PA:
The Knights Association promises that an incident this minor absolutely will not affect the course of the Major's schedule—

Maria:
Zofia... that's...

Zofia:
Ingra again, is it? For him to be killing on the field, though...

Margaret:
......

A Voice on the Display:
—Currently, visitors to events involving Infected knights are asking for the Knights Association to resolve the situation.

A Voice on the Display:
At the same time, 'Brassrust' Olmer Ingra and several other knights who were directly involved in this event have taken interviews—

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

A Corporate Employee:
Are you listening? Mr. Malkiewicz?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Oh, sorry, Jewell. Carry on.

A Corporate Employee:
Yes, sir. Actually, they're forms from the Knights Association, with the personal details and noteworthy points for all Grand Knights taking part this time.

A Corporate Employee:
The General Chamber would rather not ruin relations with these stars, so they're hoping we can be more attentive...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Let me see...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
(They're all established athletes... oh, the Radiant Knight really is in here, too.)

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Hm?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Does this 'Nightmare Knight' not have a Knightclub affiliation? I thought the Radiant Knight was the only case of an independent qualifying for the Major?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
And besides, 'Nightmare Knight'... Aren't the Grand Knights' titles usually less of a mouthful? And he doesn't have a 'The' either?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
He's not one of the Grand Knights, then? So what's so special about him?

A Corporate Employee:
Ah, this one... haha. He's been a great pain for the Knights Association to handle. I don't entirely know what's up, but...

A Corporate Employee:
He doesn't care a single bit about knight titles or any such thing, and brushes off all arrangements the General Chamber makes, but he isn't deliberately disobedient either.

A Corporate Employee:
He's a weird one.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
A weird one, huh?

A Corporate Employee:
Yes, sir, but there's no doubt about his strength. And besides, I don't know why, but it seems some knight families are extremely curious about his identity. They've tried asking the Association countless times already.

A Corporate Employee:
But we're not too clear on what's going on with him either. Things suggest he came from some rural area near Sargon?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

A Corporate Employee:
Mr. Malkiewicz?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
...I understand. You're free to go.

A Corporate Employee:
Yes, sir.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Oh, one thing, Jewell.

A Corporate Employee:
Hm? What is it?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm still the same Malkiewicz you know... so no need to be so reserved with me. I'm not used to it.

A Corporate Employee:
Ah... as you wish, I mean, understood, Mal—Mr... Malkiewicz.
