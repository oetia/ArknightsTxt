Spokesman Malkiewicz:
What's happening? Where are the campaign knights headed? The Adeptus?

Spokesman McKee:
No...

Spokesman McKee:
They went to the Wall of Champions exhibition hall, where the champions of years past are granted their awards and have their portraits displayed.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Why...? Shouldn't they be going after the government?

Spokesman McKee:
The Board of Directors is discussing that right now. The way I see it, the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi's trying to save face, and this is their first step.

Spokesman McKee:
As for their next step... well... they might try to impose martial law with the garrison.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman McKee:
But in this day and age, things aren't going to be as simple as holding a knife to somebody's neck... The foolish knights haven't realized that.

Spokesman McKee:
The era of violence is long behind us.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Hm...

Spokesman McKee:
Sorry, but you'll have to pay Area 0 another visit. The blackout will take a toll on the Infected shelter and treatment center.

Spokesman McKee:
See if it's run into any problems.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Okay.

A Corporate Employee:
Report, Mr. Spokesman. The power grid... is starting to recover! We're working to restart it now!

A silver ray of light makes its way through the darkness.

The extravagant appearance is surrounded by a boisterous audience.

The streetlights flicker, before the colorful neon lights start to rouse the city from its brief slumber.

The Silverlance Pegasus seems out of place against the backdrop of the neon billboards.

However, all those who are present: tumultuous passersby, the panicking knights, and the excited tourists...

All of them have the same misconception. They think the Pegasus is the source of the light.

And the city is slowly coming back to life behind them.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Grandmaster Ioleta.

Ioleta Russell:
It's been a while, Liam.

Ioleta Russell:
You've ventured far. Alas, it doesn't seem we have much time for rest.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
We don't need rest. There is nothing more urgent than cleaning up the filth for Kazimierz's sake.

Ioleta Russell:
Heh, look at you... Impatient as always.

Ioleta Russell:
Would you like to see tonight's main course?

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Margaret Nearl...?

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
She should not have refused your invitation. She could have been the finest among our ranks and avoided her fate.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Yet she's back in Kazimierz now, even stepping into that false arena... Did exile really change Margaret Nearl?

Ioleta Russell:
You fought her before. Do you think that's the kind of person she is?

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Hmm... Time can change everything. It might have changed her too.

Ioleta Russell:
Look at the wall behind you, Liam. Look at the champions of Majors past.

Ioleta Russell:
Why do you think these knights of this slowly collapsing era shine so brilliantly, even now?

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
An exceptional knight or two means nothing, Grandmaster.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
The knight competitions are still blasphemous and the root cause of Kazimierz's downfall.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Each of my journeys back to the Grand Knight Territory fill me with sorrow. Our people are losing respect, and our noble ideals have become a tired joke.

Ioleta Russell:
Perhaps... but that has always been the case since the campaign knights left the Grand Knight Territory.

Ioleta Russell:
Alas, the times belong to the young ones. Our conclusions no longer matter.

Shining:
So you too have realized as much, Doctor.

Shining:
I should have expected no less.

Shining:
I understand... Nearl didn't want us to return to your side during the Major to begin with.

Shining:
But I couldn't ignore the information I got from the local Infected. It was getting more and more dire by the minute... I thought I had to let you and Amiya know.

Amiya:
No, you made the right decision, Shining.

Amiya:
If the Infected are really facing... inhumane treatment in Area 0, then we can't stand idly by for the sake of our own 'safety.'

Shining:
......

Amiya:
Still... the Doctor's concerns are reasonable too... Kazimierz, Ursus, and Lungmen are all different...

Amiya:
Violence is out of the question.

Amiya:
If we cross that line, Kazimierz has the power to knock us over in a split second.

Amiya:
We're in the dead center of the Grand Knight Territory. This country might be fundamentally different from Ursus, but... this is still a nation of knights.

Amiya:
No matter how intense its internal conflicts have gotten, this is still Kazimierz.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island can't make an enemy of this place.

Amiya:
Uhh... W-We probably can't do that...

Amiya:
Even if we could buy all the Infected with money... what happens after that? You think the people of the Grand Knight Territory will just stop getting infected?

Amiya:
Besides, that would only turn the Infected into a commodity.

Amiya:
And that wouldn't solve anything.

Amiya:
The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi... We still don't know the whole truth of Area 0.

Amiya:
The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi and the K.G.C.C. are not on the best of terms, and the Adeptus's attitude towards the Infected is ambiguous at best... It's possible they've been tolerating them right from the start.

Amiya:
If that really is the case... what could Rhodes Island do?

Shining:
Doctor...

Shining:
What will you do?

An Armorless Union Member:
Over there! After her!

Greynuty:
Gah!

Greynuty:
(The power's back already... Knowing Sona, she'll find a way to rendezvous.)

An Armorless Union Member:
Call for backup right now—

Greynuty:
Turn the corner here—Nng!

Platinum:
Just as I'm enjoying my time lounging around Area 0... the lights go off on me.

Platinum:
I almost got the impression the Armorless Union was finally so stingy they stopped paying their checkpoints' power bills. Up until I got the backup request, that is.

Greynuty:
Platinum...!

Platinum:
You again...?

Platinum:
This really makes me wish you and Flametail Knight got a harder beating last time.

Greynuty:
Too bad... harder I'm beat, the harder I fight back.

Greynuty:
Now out of the way—!

Platinum:
You never learn, do you...? Guess I'll have to teach you another lesson.

Greynuty:
(She's keeping her distance—As long as I block her shot, I'll have a chance to return her attack!)

An Armorless Union Member:
She's here! Help Platinum!

Greynuty:
(Crap! Behind me—?!)

An Armorless Union Member:
Urgh!

Platinum:
What...?

Platinum:
Ngh...! Did she shatter the streetlight?

Platinum:
What if the shards cut my face? Sheesh...

Greynuty:
Justyna!

Justyna:
Ashlock, get out of there.

Justyna:
We'll hold her back somehow.

Greynuty:
Alright!

Platinum:
Don't even think about it!

Platinum:
Grr... what a pain. Let me take cover first. I'll find you...

Platinum:
......!

Platinum:
A standard-issue light crossbow doesn't have that range...

Platinum:
No, are there two of them—?

Szewczyk:
Fartooth, looks like she's on to me.

Justyna:
Time to move, then.

Justyna:
Never get into a sniper war with the Armorless. Then again... It's two-on-one right now.

Platinum:
(They stopped... Did they change positions? Smart.)

Platinum:
(If I'd known this would be such a pain, I would've ignored the call for backup...)

Platinum:
(Still...)

Platinum closes her eyes.

She thinks back to something her parents told her long ago.

They told her that her sharp eyes would bring honor and glory to the family.

Has she found glory yet?

Platinum:
I got you now, Szewczyk.

Szewczyk:
Urgh—?!

An arrow brushes past Szewczyk's face, fierce as a windstorm.

A few centimeters' difference and his brain would be torn to pieces.

Szewczyk:
—She's fighting from such a distance?!

Justyna:
Talk to me, Szewczyk!

Justyna:
Dammit! Don't stop! Keep moving!

Platinum:
Hnn—

Platinum:
This arrow's a present for you... Merry Christmas.

Justyna:
—!

Justyna:
Special arrowheads... And they go hard.

Justyna:
She can pin down our positions even in complex urban terrain like this?

Platinum:
They're gone...

Platinum:
Did they get away?

Plastic Knight:
I'm not one to run like that, Platinum.

Platinum:
......

Plastic Knight:
You... What did you do to my family?!

Plastic Knight:
What did you do to them?!

Platinum:
You realized you can't fight me at range, so you're making this a melee?

Platinum:
Good thinking.

Plastic Knight:
Ngh—

Platinum:
Pathetic... A father ending up like this because he crossed the Armorless Union.

Plastic Knight:
You little—!

Platinum:
I didn't kill your wife and child.

Plastic Knight:
—Where are you hiding them?!

Platinum:
If you just did what the Armorless Union wanted, I could get you on the phone with them..

Plastic Knight:
You...

Plastic Knight:
You want me to betray Pinus Sylvestris?

Platinum:
Are you a father... or are you a knight?

Platinum:
Do you have to go so far for the Infected, Szewczyk?

Plastic Knight:
......

Justyna:
Don't move.

Justyna:
That's as far as you go, Platinum... At this range, your reflexes are no match for my bolts.

Platinum:
Make your choice.

Plastic Knight:
Grr...

Plastic Knight:
None of you... give a damn about us knights...

Platinum:
Anyone can become a knight by joining the competitions. It's easier if you're born into knight nobility, though, yeah.

Platinum:
The knighthood... is kind of just a disappointing dream.

Plastic Knight:
Tch...!

Platinum:
—Is pride more important than your family?

Plastic Knight:
I was never going to trust you anyway, you dirty assassin!

Plastic Knight:
Do it, Fartooth!

Justyna:
—

Bald Marcin:
Looks like order has returned to the streets.

Bald Marcin:
That was a huge ruckus...

Maria:
Did Sona and her friends do all that?

Margaret:
Perhaps... there are others fanning the flames.

Margaret:
Their hearts are filled with anger. They want to rise up against their unfair treatment, and the Infected's fight... will end up exploited by another party for another purpose.

Margaret:
I've seen tragedies like this time and again.

Zofia:
Are you thinking about helping them?

Margaret:
......

Zofia:
Your choice is between fighting for the Infected and fighting as a knight. Those choices couldn't be more mutually exclusive these days—

Margaret:
—The injustice that the Infected face is just the tip of the iceberg. Suffering takes more forms than our eyes can see.

Margaret:
I believe there will be those who will uphold justice for the Infected, and I trust that they will achieve just that.

Maria:
Margaret...

Margaret:
But it's not up to us to rescue them. It'll all be meaningless if they find themselves rescued by those who already have a firm conviction.

Młynar:
A rare visitor.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
It's been some time, Sir Młynar.

Młynar:
Don't 'Sir' me. You're the only knight here.

Młynar:
If you're here for Margaret, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
It has been years since I last came back to the Grand Knight Territory. I am shocked to find our hero's estate... in this shape.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Have the sisters moved out?

Młynar:
......

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
My apologies... That is your family issue.

Młynar:
Was there something else...?

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Sir Młynar—

Młynar:
Stop calling me that.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Others may look down on you, but we will not.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Even if Margaret strayed onto the wrong path and her younger sister is still young, the Nearl family didn't earn our respect riding on a legacy of fame.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
The boastful merchants have not realized this fundamental idea, and that is why they do not understand the actions that knights take.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
And, truly, just seeing you in good health eases my mind.

Młynar:
You mean my appearance? Spare me the pleasantries, sir.

Młynar:
If you truly have any respect for me, please leave.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Sir Młynar.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
We have the utmost respect for you... no, for the Nearl family.

Młynar:
The age of heroes is long behind us...

Młynar:
Does a mere citizen of Kazimierz like me really deserve such respect from a Silverlance Pegasus?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
What a bizarre evening, Doctor...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
It'll be daybreak soon. I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner. The K.G.C.C. has a lot on its hands, after all...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'd like to think... there's no hidden meaning in that question.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You are a clever one.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Right...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Do you think that... the way the Grand Knight Territory treats its Infected is a reasonable measure?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You don't need to answer me. Both you and I know the answer—It's only a compromise.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
We could neither make the perfect, humane solution nor bring ourselves to go with the bloody, primitive answer, and this is the result.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm not sure if you've noticed, but our society today is built on top of all kinds of unreasonable things. You might want to poke through our history books a little.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You may not know this... but after the nation of pegasi was overthrown in the upheaval wrought by the Nightzmora and this country of knights came to be, it was the affinities who actually banded together first.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The affinities toiled away for the knights' profits and tended their lands. Then, they came together, and chased the tyrannical knights off the stage.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
And now? The K.G.C.C. controls both a hitman agency and the competition knights, and those who are being controlled will always try to rise up and break free of tyranny—

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
History repeats itself, Doctor.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The spokesman before me had some dirty dealings too. He paid the price for them, and now it's my turn to step into this position, pressing forward no matter how hard the job.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Does all this fit your concept of morality? Is it 'reasonable?'

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I don't know how you've come to know this, but you've no doubt already noticed...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The way the General Chamber has decided to deal with those who get injured in the arena, those whose Oripathy has progressed beyond control... is to put them out of their misery.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Is it unreasonable? Of course. I want to tell them 'no' myself.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
But do we have to keep treating those Oripathy patients, when this disease is incurable?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Each day that Oripathy remains incurable is yet another day where coexistence is out of reach.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Everyone who found it unreasonable has been eliminated, creating this thoroughly reasonable history. Fortunately, I've accepted this truth. You understand me, don't you?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You're trying to take on Kazimierz... and I suggest you stop.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
We may have other options, and if you can think of anything, I'll be more than willing to help.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
But not right now.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The prime suspect in last night's blackout is none other than the Infected knights.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Let's suppose the blackout caused a traffic accident... or an elderly person who relies on a ventilator stopped breathing because of it—

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Will we have to turn a blind eye to tragedies like these in the name of helping the Infected?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Allowing the Infected to participate in the competitions in large numbers has been a source of stress to everyone—

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
And this stress comes not from some organization or people out there. It comes from society itself, Doctor.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
There are many people dying of unnatural causes right this moment. Disease, Catastrophe. We can't help everyone.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm sorry.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
True...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
If you have an idea... I'm sure you'll get it done.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
But please remember what I just said. Don't treat this whole affair like you're helping the elderly cross the street.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The contradictions that persist in Area 0 are complicated.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Sorry... Perhaps I've gone too far with my words.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
It'll benefit the both of us if you could calm down and think all this over, carefully.

Gravel:
...Doctor.

Gravel:
Someone here to see you.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'll get out of your way...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
And don't get the wrong idea... If possible, I would like to be on your side.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
That said, it's difficult to find the one best answer out of all the unreasonable things we can do nothing about.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You're right... The blackout, the Radiant Knight, and the Blood Knight... It all fueled the Infected knights' will to resist.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Before everything gets out of hand, I hope both you and I can keep casualties... to a minimum.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
'Goodness pays off,' or so it's often said, but I'm afraid this no longer holds true in our society. Unless, that is, you reach out and grab hold of the payoff yourself.
