An Infected Knight:
Topple the Chamber! Topple the nobles! Death to Olmer Ingra!

An Infected Knight:
Topple the Chamber! Topple the nobles! Death to Olmer Ingra!

Justyna:
......

Justyna:
Wrath is spreading between us.

Justyna:
I get it, but...

Sona:
Wrath. We're all used to that state of mind.

Sona:
But it makes a person short-sighted. We've already suffered for it.

Iwona:
Hah. Keeping a clear head sure ain't my style.

Sona:
You don't need to keep it, just charge ahead with it, that's all.

Iwona:
I can roll with that. Sure, I'll leave the complicated stuff to you guys, and the fights, you leave to me.

Iwona:
I've been holding this in forever, Sona.

Sona:
I know.

Sona:
Before Szewczyk and Ashley come back, we need to find people who were there... reporters work, heck, eyewitnesses work. The more, the better.

Justyna:
...The Great Kawalerielki Separation.

Justyna:
External reports said it was an industrial accident caused by damage from Leithanian extremists, to shatter the smooth running of the Major.

Sona:
No city comes that weak. More than likely it was everyone dragging each other down.

Sona:
But what's clear is the whole shake-up showed people just where Kawalerielki... this 'City of Greatness' was rotting through.

Greynuty:
......

Greynuty:
Never mind me, you're sort of a famous knight too, aren't you? Won't strutting around like this get you recognized?

Plastic Knight:
Who'd care about a nobody like me while the Major's on?

Plastic Knight:
Why are you the one going with me? I thought it'd be that sniper. She's a better fit with this sort of thing.

Greynuty:
Justyna? She's more liable to get exposed than I am, actually, not to mention she's already the one who dared to rescue you.

Greynuty:
No need to keep dangerous elements together, and you're both bow knights. If you did get attacked in the streets, it'd be tough to handle.

Plastic Knight:
Isn't that nice. No, you just wanted to keep an eye on me, didn't you?

Greynuty:
Hmph.

Greynuty:
A knight-noble wouldn't make peace with the Infected, even if he clashed with the Armorless. Do you really think I'd let my guard down around you?

Plastic Knight:
Rubbish. I worry I'll get infected, and I worry my family will. What's wrong with that?

Plastic Knight:
Don't think you're my lone disbeliever, Ashlock Knight.

Greynuty:
Really? Then now seems like your best chance to escape, Plastic Knight.

Greynuty:
So long as—

Plastic Knight:
—You shut up, you petulant brat.

Greynuty:
......

Plastic Knight:
I didn't come to play rise of the weak with you. I don't give a damn about your demands, or whether you need your trust in each other to live—

Plastic Knight:
—I only came to hunt those audacious bastards down. I guarantee the Armorless will give me hell, and they'll put my family through worse doing it, so I'm making the first damned move.

Plastic Knight:
That's why I'm here now. My wife, my child, and no one else. Believe me, I don't have the slightest concern for your ridiculous cause.

Plastic Knight:
Don't get so full of yourself, Infected. You think the only thing that makes up this city is 'your enemies' and 'your friends?' What a model victim complex...

Plastic Knight:
Let me tell you, in Kazimierz, in this society of ours, the majority are 'not concerned with you at all.'

Greynuty:
It's quiet around here.

Plastic Knight:
This is the General Chamber's ground floor. Only nomadic city engineers and maintenance crew are allowed into the structuring below us. We'll have to stop here.

Plastic Knight:
Hmph.

Greynuty:
......

Plastic Knight:
Relax, no need to be so cautious. No cameras here.

Greynuty:
But can you guarantee there's no Armorless?

Plastic Knight:
Hilarious. The Armorless wouldn't choose a public venue—especially not a hub of the elite like this to start killing.

Plastic Knight:
It'd give the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi too much of a hold on them. That's where they draw the line, and we're going to toe that line for all it's worth.

Plastic Knight:
Realistically, how many knights does Kazimierz have? They've got nothing but ID-type fodder to judge who's who... it's child's play to disguise.

Greynuty:
So what is your family going to do?

Plastic Knight:
Aside from my missing wife and child, they've been sent out of Kawalerielki already.

Greynuty:
The Armorless Union has its informants far beyond where Kawalerielki ends.

Plastic Knight:
I know that.

Plastic Knight:
Maybe if I get another chance, I'll cut back on the recklessness. At least until my child grows up, and can take care of himself.

Plastic Knight:
But the K.G.C.C. don't sell remedies for regret. This is where we are, Infected, so we'd better put the complaining to rest.

A Corporate Employee:
Huff... dammit, the supermarkets and restaurants are all shut. Why did they set a meeting for this time.

A Corporate Employee:
*Sigh*... If I revise the draft early morning, maybe they won't chew me out so hard in editing—

A Corporate Employee:
—Huh?

Sona:
Sorry to bother you. You must be pretty beat after a long day of work, huh, Mister Reporter?

A Corporate Employee:
A... A knight? Where did you come from?!

Sona:
Easy now, sir.

Sona:
Want a sandwich?

A Corporate Employee:
H—Huh?!

Sona:
C'mon. I'm asking because you look like someone dragged you through a car wash.

A Corporate Employee:
Please leave immediately, or I'll sound the alarm! Even if you're a knight, this is...

A Corporate Employee:
Eep?

Sona:
Your phone lines are cut.

Sona:
Here's the deal. Both your neighbors are out far away, and right now, my partners in crime are pretending to be renovation workers, carrying out rush repairs on this building's elevator and entrance.

A Corporate Employee:
Wh... What the hell are you trying to do? I don't have any money, I don't know anything...

Sona:
Easy, there, wind it down. You make me out like I'm a robber here.

Sona:
You. There was a report on the 'Great Kawalerielki Separation' a few years back. You wrote that, right?

A Corporate Employee:
M... Me?

A Corporate Employee:
With an incident that huge, every outlet in the whole country would be reporting on it. There's no way I didn't write something...

A Corporate Employee:
B—But, I'm just a net editor... I was still working at The Illuminator then, and by now that whole paper's been bought out.

Sona:
Mm-hm, I know, which is why you only need to answer a couple questions for us, and then we're gone. Sound good?

Sona:
We just want to get an idea of the situation. And we got you supper on the side.

A Corporate Employee:
(Err... is she actually carrying a bag of sandwiches?)

Sona:
You had an interview in your report with a pretty unassuming janitor, who said 'I thought there was an earthquake, and I climbed out of the transport pipes, I was so desperate.'

Sona:
Looking at the picture, this is the General Chamber of Commerce Tower, right? During the Great Separation, the electricals were all out, but the Chamber has a standalone power source.

Sona:
Can you give me some details about what you... saw of things?

An Armorless Union Member:
Reporting in, 'Lazurite' Monique.

An Armorless Union Member:
We have traces of movement from a few targets here. They've split up to investigate something. And the Kuranta 'Wild Mane' Iwona Krukowska is nearby guarding the Infected.

Monique:
They've set up an Infected community.

Monique:
But they're still hoping their own strength, their own violence will protect it from falling apart?

Monique:
Is this how stupid knights have gotten these days?

An Armorless Union Member:
Right. Here's their list of contacts... and some calls we've intercepted from them.

An Armorless Union Member:
They're very cunning, steering clear of wireless communication. There's a good chance these messages are all a smokescreen.

Monique:
Forget anything else, they're investigating the 'Great Kawalerielki Separation.'

An Armorless Union Member:
Er... how do you...

Monique:
If your deductions are as convoluted next time, either you're dead, or you're out of a job. Learn a thing or two.

An Armorless Union Member:
R—Right! Please give your instructions!

Monique:
(Exasperated sigh) With Wild Mane Knight left alone, what instructions could you even need?

An Armorless Union Member:
S—Sorry, I'll go give the order to surround—

Monique:
If anything happens with the media or Adeptus Sprawiedliwi, will your heads on the chopping block even make up for it?

An Armorless Union Member:
I... I can't...

Monique:
Forget it. I'll go myself.

An Armorless Union Member:
Y—You don't need to go to the trouble!

Monique:
It's not right to pull off that big of a maneuver before any official orders come from up top.

Monique:
Taking out an Infected knight's nothing difficult, but it has to be silent, no hide nor hair. Can any of you do that?

An Armorless Union Member:
Well...

Monique:
If you get it, then zip it, and while it's zipped, drag Roy back for me. They could've picked anyone to keep watch on the Nightzmora. Why waste a Lazurite's time on the clock?

Monique:
Seriously...

Monique:
Target, confirmed. Wild Mane Knight, Iwona Krukowska.

Monique:
Date, weather, present state of mind... but this isn't an official assignment. I shouldn't need to record so much detail.

Monique:
Hmm. And no need to kill too many Infected. It'll be terrible on the million-to-one I get infected myself.

Monique:
Anyway...

Iwona:
Huh, wonder what that sweet smell's about.

Iwona:
Flowers? Who's planting flowers here?

'Justice Knight':
(Relaxed beeping noises)

Iwona:
Whaaat?! Who knew you could do this stuff too, Justice!

'Justice Knight':
(Hurried beeping noises)

Swoosh.

Loosing a rubber arrow, Justice Knight knocks over the plastic water bottle beside it, fresh water hydrating the flowerpot in front of them.

'Justice Knight':
(Loud beeping noises)

Iwona:
Justice! You're amazing! Did you learn to do this yourself?!

'Justice Knight':
(Loud beeping noises)

Iwona:
—What?!

Iwona:
Whoa, watch out! The wall's come down!

'Justice Knight':
(Hurried beeping noises)

Iwona:
No questions! Move!

'Justice Knight':
(Hurried beeping noises)

Iwona:
Tch—

Monique:
(Couldn't confirm my position, so she immediately began vacating. Solid intuition.)

Monique:
(But... this is too slow of a pace.)

Monique:
I'll be seeing you.

A Gofer Armorless Union Member:
So we just come back like this? And, uh, the Union shouldn't be randomly waltzing into the General Chamber's building, should it?

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
*Sigh* Of course we can't, logically.

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
But you can't ignore a Lazurite's orders... ugh, I didn't have a boss this annoying back when I was a merc.

A Gofer Armorless Union Member:
Won't it be a little... unsafe, leaving Monique alone in the Infected ghetto?

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
Ha, you're worrying about her? What, us? Worried about a Lazurite?

A Gofer Armorless Union Member:
Well... the Lazurites are people too, and she looks pretty young...

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
*Sigh*... You've never seen the Lazurites get serious first-hand? You'll wanna make sure to prepare yourself, then.

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
Have you heard how it goes? 'Platinum' needs to be someone with the leadership to guide a team, the brains to plan out the big picture in the most involved operations.

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
As for the 'Lazurites'... they say the ones of the past, whether one or two... were all chosen because they could 'kill any one target in Kazimierz.'

A Gofer Armorless Union Member:
Uh... you're kidding, right? Any? Including all those campaign knights?

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
Well, that's lost to history... I'm not sure if it's true or not. They say even a few campaign knight leaders were—

Roy:
Oh, hey, what's got you two so excited?

A Gofer Armorless Union Member:
Erk...

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
R-Roy, sir!

Roy:
You know something? People will suspect the Armorless Union, showing up publicly at the K.G.C.C.

Roy:
It might be comedy to you, but you guys should take a guess. There's a reason they don't let the Union wander in and out of here... why?

A Gofer Armorless Union Member:
(Shudder) I—It... it's not like that...

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
Sir, this is a misunderstanding. Monique wanted us here to notify you. Otherwise, we would never—

Roy:
Ahahaha, why so tense? What, you scared I'm gonna eat you?

A Gofer Armorless Union Member:
......

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
As... long as you understand. Monique's carrying something out in the Infected ghettos, and she wanted us to inform you.

Roy:
Infected, huh.

Roy:
Alright, got it. Thanks for the notice.

Roy:
Now get out of here quick, it smells of sterilizer everywhere. Hm, but the coffee downstairs is pretty good. You can steal a cup before you go.

Roy:
See you. Hope you have fun with work~

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
Phew.

A Gofer Armorless Union Member:
......

A Gofer Armorless Union Member:
...Ulk... *cough* *cough*... urp...

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
Where's the bathroom... *sigh* I told you to prepare yourself.

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
I'm lucky enough I was a merc, but most others who switch jobs to join us are in for a little roughness. Just ride it out.

A Gofer Armorless Union Member:
Urgh... hah, hah... am I still alive?

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
You are, you are. Now you get it, don't you? We shouldn't get mixed up with their work.

A Seasoned Armorless Union Member:
And Monique wouldn't mess up.

Iwona:
—?!

Iwona:
(Another wide shot? What's the deal?)

Iwona:
(But this force—I still can't clock the position—is the enemy messing with me?!)

Iwona:
Dammit—

Iwona:
Is this all I can do?! Run?!

Monique:
Missed... grr.

Monique:
You...

Toland:
Hey, miss, don't give me that look. I just wanted to ask you about something.

Monique:
......

Toland:
Am I disturbing you? If you're not up to answer, I'll go on my way.

Monique:
What is it?

Toland:
Ah, thank you. Actually, I'm looking for someone—

Toland:
—'Lazurite' Monique. It's a pseudonym, of course. Heard of her, if you don't mind me asking?

Monique:
As it happens, I'm looking for someone too.

Toland:
Oh? Sorry to confess, I'm fresh on the boat here. Can't say I recognize all that many heads or tails yet.

Monique:
That's alright, he's a plenty infamous bounty hunter. Seeing him once would be enough to remember.

Toland:
Hoo. Go on, do tell?

Monique:
The 'Guildmaster', Toland Cash.

Monique:
Thirteen counts of murder, eight of robbery, twenty-three of disturbing the peace, six of illegal Originium dealing... and to top it off—conspiracy, on one count.

Monique:
Also, most importantly, he's gotten in the way of my work... twice, now.

Monique:
I hate people who get in the way of my work. Despise them.

Toland:
Well, well... Say, ever think you've gotten the wrong idea about him?

Monique:
All of us turn a blind eye to the bounty hunters' influence by default... but they shouldn't have organized, let alone grown large-scale.

Toland:
That's not fair to say. With 'Flamelung' and 'Yellow Smog' suddenly AWOL—poor brothers—that big of a territory without any boss, of course there's gotta be an organization. Work needs it to go smooth.

Monique:
......

Toland:
Go ahead. Calls always come at the worst times, don't they?

Monique:
It's me. I'm working.

Monique:
...Got it.

Toland:
It seems you're leaving. What an awful shame.

Toland:
Tell Miss Monique I said hi.

Monique:
Likewise, then. Tell Toland this for me.

Monique:
Tell him—

Monique:
—That slippery little clown face of yours spoils my appetite.

Toland:
We really had a close shave there, Kuranta.

Toland:
She might not catch up to me, but I'm sure she'd win the fight.

Iwona:
Who... the hell are you?

Toland:
I'll introduce myself again. Toland Cash, just a bounty hunter.

Toland:
I come in good faith—that's my real name, you know. My old daddy gave it to me before he drank himself to the other side. True story.

Iwona:
Bounty guy, just now, that was the Armorless Union's...

Toland:
The Armorless Union's Lazurite. Put away any funny ideas of chasing her—you'd all be done for then.

Toland:
But if even the Lazurite's showing up to this party, that means I'm in the right place.

Iwona:
You're mad off the mark if you want treasure. Only the Infected, homeless and penniless living out the days here.

Iwona:
What are you here looking for? Huh, bounty hunter?

Toland:
The will to rebel.

Toland:
I came on this informant's info, see... heard you guys were planning something real extraordinary.

Toland:
I don't want you to jump the gun, now. There's no traitors in your gang, and I can tell you they didn't have the loose lips to blab to me.

Toland:
But when the city moves forward, it sucks everyone into the wake. You can't just make believe it's only 'heroes' and 'villains' in the Grand Knight Territory, right?

Iwona:
I'm not Sona. I'm not all good at chewing this stuff over.

Iwona:
But seeing how you just saved my life, I guess I can show you to someone or other.

Toland:
Now THAT'S what I call lifesaving.

'Justice Knight':
(Slow beeping noises)

Toland:
Oh? What's this? A takeout cart?

Iwona:
Takeout, my ass! This is my pet! My pride and joy! You watch what you say!

Toland:
Hah, knights really have gotten interesting.

Monique:
I suddenly understand why I hate seeing Toland Cash so much.

Roy:
Why's that?

Monique:
Because he's too much like you.

Roy:
*cough*... Are you calling me out?

Monique:
Get on with it. What did you interrupt me for?

Roy:
You've been too hard at it lately. Isn't it nice, relaxing every once in a while?

Monique:
I'm heading back to work.

Roy:
No, nuh-uh, you've been getting more and more workaholic lately.

Roy:
See, the curtain's pulled open on the Radiant Knight's Major adventure, and I'm not exactly resting easy with just Platinum on the case.

Roy:
And the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi has been scarily quiet this year. Usually they'd be firing opening shots against the Board of Directors by now, what with all their documents and meetings.

Monique:
And this is your grounds for shirking work?

Roy:
Not entirely. The 'three above' are having us keep this in check lately.

Monique:
Hmm.

Roy:
To be strict about it, the Infected are creating an opportunity for us.

Roy:
Darksteel'll seize that to eliminate the last of those who know what really happened, and shift the blame to the Infected.

Roy:
What we should be doing now isn't harming the Infected. When it comes to it, in fact, we even ought to give them a little help from the shadows.

Roy:
But we can't be too obvious about this, so I let you enjoy the hassle of finding them, seeing it through to the end.

Monique:
Work really does shift under your feet when it wants.

Roy:
We're on the Board of Directors's dime, after all. All we can do is be their people.

Roy:
Provisionally, of course.

Monique:
Heh.

Monique:
How's the Nightzmora business going?

Roy:
Not much to be concerned with, just a moron tracing the footsteps of old-timey legends.

Roy:
We'll fix up a match for him to face one of the Grand Knights later. After the 'Nightzmora reenactment' thing gets enough buzz, it can get dumped.

Roy:
That's 'knights' for you, after all. A Nightzmora orphan living in the present day—it's gotta be hard on the soul.

Old Knight:
......

Nightmare Knight:
Batbayar, what are you following me for?

Old Knight:
You can drop that tone with me like you're on your victory lap. There's youth in your voice. Odds are you're younger than me.

Old Knight:
Are you always so... aimless?

Nightmare Knight:
......

Old Knight:
Don't you have anywhere to go? A titled Major knight being a tramp in Kawalerielki, really?

Nightmare Knight:
......

Nightmare Knight:
Cities disgust me.

Nightmare Knight:
Walking helps clear the mind. Kurantas always walk the grasslands.

Old Knight:
It ain't no grassland here.

Nightmare Knight:
It should be.

Old Knight:
And you just go on like this?

Nightmare Knight:
......

Old Knight:
How long has it been?

Nightmare Knight:
Ten years or so. Or however many. I can't even remember now.

Old Knight:
Er... but you did get a lift to reach Kawalerielki, right?

Nightmare Knight:
......

Old Knight:
You crossed Kazimierz on foot?!

Old Knight:
R—Rubbish. You've really never 'stopped' before? Don't you even need to rest?

Nightmare Knight:
Batbayar, do you know of the 'Khaganquest?'

Old Knight:
...What...

Nightmare Knight:
It was once... the apotheosis of a Kuranta's glory.

Nightmare Knight:
At the time a warrior comes of age, in order to manifest their glory as a Kuranta, in the company of their mother and father, they would make a promise.

Nightmare Knight:
From the place they were born, they would leave for a distant site of trial. Taking only a weapon gifted by their parents, they would go on foot.

Old Knight:
A site of trial...?

Nightmare Knight:
The site of trial is decided by themselves. True courage must be recognized by themselves.

Nightmare Knight:
The way of the courageous spans a thousand folds of the earth, while the cowardly only dared choose the forests before their own door.

Nightmare Knight:
A distance or lack of it was by no means the sole judge. Some brave brought back the heads of prey; some brave cut off their enemies' ears; some brave were empty-handed, but bountiful with pure gold and spices.

Nightmare Knight:
Our forebears never once forgot this tradition. This was proof of valor. Countless Nightzmora soldiers walked the Khaganquest, as the start of their long journey.

Old Knight:
So, right now, you're... you're completing your rite of adulthood alone?

Old Knight:
Where's your parents?

Nightmare Knight:
Since I can recall, I had no one at all.

Nightmare Knight:
Batbayar, I'm not ashamed to admit. To be with you, one of the same blood, no matter how distant, consoles me somewhat.

Nightmare Knight:
At least, it lets me take in that, in this age twistedly proceeding, my past brethren... are still alive.

Old Knight:
Alright... Are you gonna hang around the Grand Knight Territory like this for the time being, then?

Nightmare Knight:
Kawalerielki... I learned from the travelers, this place is the center of the land of the knights, Kazimierz's glory.

Nightmare Knight:
Yet now I see, it's no more than a rotting fort, trampling the glory, the honor that should shine esteemed.

Nightmare Knight:
Once, my brethren were trialed in their Khaganquests by beast and Catastrophe. And what I face now, is a forward-roaring, grassland-crushing metal titan.

Nightmare Knight:
......

Nightmare Knight:
It happens to block my Khaganquest.

Nightmare Knight:
So I will conquer it, in order to prove my fatedness.

Spokesman McKee:
Each knight in Kawalerielki has their own reason to fight.

Spokesman McKee:
Maybe many of the ignorant beyond Kazimierz would criticize the modern knight competitions as 'defying tradition,' 'renouncing glory.'

Spokesman McKee:
But we're not of that mind at all. The times are changing, industry and finance are expanding. Do you honestly still want the people putting stock in the traditions of killing? Rampant duels paid with blood, in modern society?

Spokesman McKee:
No, the General Chamber of Commerce finds it very hard to sanction such things.

Candle Knight:
Cities springing up, engines rumbling as they turn.

Candle Knight:
This is an age of rapid progress. Yes, wildly unlike it was over a decade ago, Mr. McKee.

Spokesman McKee:
Madam Droste. The General Chamber expects your certain victory.

Spokesman McKee:
The Infected knight crisis is intensifying. Taken as a locus, the Radiant Knight will extol it, and the Board of Directors will lose great face over it.

Candle Knight:
I understand.

Spokesman McKee:
I... *sigh* I don't mean to trouble you—I'm guessing you still won't accept our proposals, will you?

Spokesman McKee:
But I hope you'll realize, you won't actually need to do anything.

Candle Knight:
McKee.

Candle Knight:
I want to decide a victor between me and the Radiant Knight, fair and square.

Spokesman McKee:
......

Candle Knight:
'I won't need to do anything.' These last few years, I've always been solicited as such.

Candle Knight:
Mr. McKee, as a knight, inaction itself is one brand of action. Can you sympathize with that?

Spokesman McKee:
I...

Candle Knight:
Am I not even allowed the satisfaction of a single request anymore? Mr. McKee?

Spokesman McKee:
No... if you really are so determined... I'll try and talk over the Knights Association and the other spokesmen.

Spokesman McKee:
But... can you tell me why? You have no preexisting relationship with the Radiant Knight, as far as we know... What makes you so insistent?

Candle Knight:
Why is the General Chamber so focused on her?

Candle Knight:
Though she's of a famous family, she is no more than a knight once banished, in the end.

Candle Knight:
Tell me, just what is the K.G.C.C. so focused on?

Spokesman McKee:
This isn't something you and I should discuss right now, Madam Droste.

Spokesman McKee:
But... alright. Behind this affair, it's a contest between the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi and the General Chamber.

Spokesman McKee:
In fact, neither the K.G.C.C. nor the Adeptus ultimately care too much who 'takes the championship.'

Spokesman McKee:
Do you understand? I've currently obliged with you... I respect your way of thinking, but your steadfastness is harming the K.G.C.C.'s outlook towards you.

Candle Knight:
I'll explain to the knightclub myself.

Spokesman McKee:
Our Leithanian visitors wouldn't want to see any mishaps befall you in the arena, either.

Candle Knight:
Mishaps? Losing to an Infected champion, you mean?

Candle Knight:
I've no illusions of the way they work. The Candle Knight Viviana Droste is celebrated so because she is a Leithanian.

Candle Knight:
A Leithanian, finding success in the Kazimierz knight competitions, makes them beam.

Candle Knight:
And since the Black Knight, it's a glory they've taken for granted. I became a substitute for the Black Knight by luck, no more.

Candle Knight:
No more than vanity.

Spokesman McKee:
It might be vain of them, yes, but their support for you is authentic. The K.G.C.C. is hoping to sign a trade agreement with the nobles at this moment, and your impact cannot be ignored.

Candle Knight:
McKee.

Candle Knight:
Two knights meet in a contest, hoping to fight a fair battle. Is this something so inherently forbidden?

Spokesman McKee:
No. You're... you're right.

Candle Knight:
Kazimierz, Leithanien. The home that birthed me.

Candle Knight:
In childhood I imagined, that the place I lived was one where romance and glory could coexist.

Candle Knight:
I simply want to... see, with this 'special case,' this Radiant Knight. See who comes out on top.

Candle Knight:
At least this once, I won't need to consider how to 'win beautifully.' I only need to consider how to claim victory.

Candle Knight:
Is that not abideable?

Spokesman McKee:
The outcome won't change.

Spokesman McKee:
The K.G.C.C. will find some way to force the Radiant Knight's loss. Losing to you was the most appropriate decision to make.

Candle Knight:
You support them?

Spokesman McKee:
In order to prevent this situation from degrading further... in order not to give the Adeptus more excuses to revolt, yes, I support this decision.

Candle Knight:
......

Candle Knight:
McKee.

Spokesman McKee:
Yes?

Candle Knight:
I'm somewhat disappointed in you.

Spokesman McKee:
My deepest apologies, Madam.

Spokesman McKee:
But... I believe it is the best option...

Spokesman McKee:
My deepest apologies.

Candle Knight:
There's a celebration feast tonight. I'll need to be on my way soon.

Spokesman McKee:
Right... May you travel safely.

Candle Knight:
McKee.

Candle Knight:
I merely, simply want to be witness in this age to a knight's radiance. True radiance.

Candle Knight:
She's just as if a verse.

Candle Knight:
Nothing more than that.

Candle Knight:
Farewell.

Spokesman McKee:
A verse, was it?

Spokesman McKee:
Perhaps. But those poems you read... I've never once actually managed to make sense of one, Viviana.

A Corporate Employee:
Mr. McKee? Did you order flowers? The doorman's gotten a bouquet of marigolds, and says you ordered them.

Spokesman McKee:
Yes.

Spokesman McKee:
It was your anniversary recently, wasn't it?

A Corporate Employee:
Oh—uh? It was—you remembered that?

Spokesman McKee:
It's my gift to you two. You've been a credit to your job. Don't forget to go home and spend time with your family.

A Corporate Employee:
Wow! Mr. McKee! Thank you! Thank you so, so much!

Spokesman McKee:
That's fine. If you've got nothing important, go on and sign off a little early.

Spokesman McKee:
You can't live without treasuring life.
