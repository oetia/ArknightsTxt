A Voice on the Broadcast:
Our champion, having appeared out of nowhere, has put a stop to the battle with a thunderous momentum!

A Voice on the Broadcast:
Last night's match was cut short when Nightmare Knight's Arts were ruled a violation, and the one who stopped things from getting even further out of hand was the hero, the Blood Knight!

A Voice on the Broadcast:
The match between the Radiant Knight and Nightmare Knight ended in a tie, and Nightmare will be facing the Blood Knight, whose opponent has dropped out, in his next round—

Greynuty:
A tie...? Nightmare broke the rules. Shouldn't they have promoted the Radiant Knight to the next round?

Sona:
They don't want to let an Infected to just move up the ranks like that, of course.

Sona:
Where's Szewczyk?

Justyna:
He's with his family. Give him some time.

Greynuty:
To be honest... I didn't really care much about him to begin with.

Sona:
We can tell.

Justyna:
True enough. Were you trying to hide it?

Greynuty:
......

Sona:
He's still alive, real flesh and blood, right?

Sona:
The city makes us forget it a lot... but we're all alive.

Sona:
We should have our own choices, our own lives... instead of drifting about in the endlessly beating waves, never to find out who we really are.

A Voice on the Broadcast:
The battle of a lifetime between the Blood Knight and Nightmare Knight will begin tomorrow evening!

A Voice on the Broadcast:
Be sure to tune into the Night of Knights channel tomorrow at 8 o'clock for the best competition experience!

'Justice Knight':
(Loud beeping noises)

Iwona:
Oh... Justice! You're okay!

Sona:
Iwona! You can't get up yet.

Greynuty:
Come, I'll help you.

Iwona:
Heh... Thanks, Ashley.

Sona:
I thought I had exclusive rights to the nickname Ashley?

Iwona:
Haha, let me borrow it for a while.

Sona:
You're gonna have to pay for using my trademark.

Sona:
Iwona, that day...

Iwona:
Yeah, I saw the Blood Knight's silhouette.

Justyna:
There were traces of blood Arts...

Justyna:
It's... a really awful kind of Arts. As things are, just casting normal Arts is enough to make me ache. I can't imagine how much pain the Blood Knight has to bear, controlling Arts like that.

Iwona:
The Blood Knight... He's strong.

Sona:
Everybody knows.

Sona:
It's thanks to the Blood Knight that the Infected won the right to fight in the Major.

Greynuty:
We became the K.G.C.C.'s playthings... We lost our dignity and freedom... but we're still alive.

Iwona:
It's only by staying alive that we have the chance to run.

Justyna:
Between the Radiant Knight and the Blood Knight, who do you support, girls?

Iwona:
The Blood Knight. No doubt about it. He's the one who opened up the future for us Infected.

Greynuty:
But what we need is an unflagging fight instead of the status quo... so I choose the Radiant Knight.

Greynuty:
And you?

Justyna:
I pick Sona.

Iwona:
You can do that?!

Platinum:
You called...?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman McKee:
The Board has made their decision... Area 0 will be wiped clean.

Spokesman McKee:
Our current strategy with the Infected is a mistake.

Platinum:
A mistake, huh...?

Spokesman McKee:
Moreover, Rhodes Island's leader has been digging too deep into the Area 0 affair. This is a lapse on the Armorless Union's part.

Platinum:
......

Spokesman McKee:
Several executive directors are strongly demanding the Armorless Union eradicate this threat. Do not let Rhodes Island's medical team leave Kazimierz alive.

Spokesman McKee:
Any issues?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Platinum:
None... but this is only an order from 'several executive directors' and not the whole Board. Right?

Spokesman McKee:
That is not for you to question. We have authority over your command.

Platinum:
Point of order, it's Mr. Malkiewicz over there who has authority over me.

Spokesman McKee:
Malkiewicz... You know what to do.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Zofia:
Are you hurt?

Margaret:
Yeah... Probably when I blocked his strike.

Margaret:
I couldn't feel a thing at the time... but it might have bruised a bone or two.

Zofia:
Hold still. Let me see...

Zofia:
You need a doctor. This will affect your performance.

Maria:
Maybe put some ice on it.

Margaret:
Alright.

Maria:
Can't we heal this with Arts?

Zofia:
That will alleviate the pain and help the wound heal, but if she's got any broken bones, she could end up worse in the future if we don't take proper care of them.

Zofia:
What do we do? You're up against the Wind Knight the next match... That's a strong opponent. If you have to fight this hurt...

Margaret:
Don't worry so much.

Zofia:
How am I supposed to not worry?!

Margaret:
It's just a minor injury. I'm more than used to this.

Maria:
You call this... minor...?

Maria:
Margaret... You've worked so hard, and you've gotten so strong... What is it all for?

Maria:
To become a champion?

Margaret:
'You cannot surmount the rulesetters within their own rules.' Isn't that what Uncle said?

Maria:
Mhm...

Zofia:
But that's just because Młynar—

Margaret:
No, I get it.

Margaret:
He's right.

Margaret:
But it's not the rulesetters that we need to defeat.

Margaret:
We need to break free of the rules. We need to teach those who have been tamed to rise up, help those who have fallen to regain the light.

Margaret:
Uncle Młynar... He doesn't believe that there are still those who would follow a lighthouse's beam and charge into the storm.

Margaret:
But I don't agree with him.

Margaret:
If we can dispel this darkness, the people will push forward.

Old Knight:
You need to listen to the doctor and rest up for a few days.

Old Knight:
Your next match is against the Wind Knight, right? If you don't recover by then, it won't go well for you.

Bald Marcin:
Don't end up like me...

Bald Marcin:
I knew my arm was no good, but I pushed myself even further. This is what I got.

Margaret:
Right. You needn't worry about me.

Maria:
Margaret... Look! Ta-dah!

Margaret:
The new gauntlet?

Margaret:
Already...? That's amazing. I thought it'd take you until tomorrow.

Old Craftsman:
It probably would've taken me another two or three days if I was working by myself.

Old Craftsman:
We didn't adjust your gauntlet around your new weapon last time, not that we'd know where to start.

Old Craftsman:
But that taught us a lesson, and it really got Maria working.

Margaret:
Maria... I know some excellent craftsmen. Perhaps I should introduce them to you.

Maria:
Really?! Where are they from?

Margaret:
All over. Ursus, Leithanien, Higashi, Laterano... you name it.

Maria:
Whoa... That's like a whole guild of master craftsmen... Hm? Why would a pharma company need so many craftsmen, though?

Margaret:
You'll just have to find out for yourself.

Margaret:
This reminds me... there was this one year when Uncle Młynar bought you a small drone for your birthday.

Margaret:
You had the thing torn apart that afternoon.

Maria:
I... I put it back together after that, though.

Old Craftsman:
I was shocked, you know. It might not have flown again after she put it back together, but I never expected the kid to have such amazing talent—

Old Craftsman:
—I half expected Maria to become a knight back then, though. Otherwise, I'd have entrusted her with my workshop.

Old Knight:
You better get on that, Kowal. Who knows when you'll kick the bucket?

Old Craftsman:
Huh? Cursing me now, are you?!

Margaret:
Do you want to pursue your interests, Maria?

Maria:
Erm... I don't know yet.

Old Knight:
Hah, Maria's still young.

Maria:
I just know that... it's been a very long time since we talked like this...

Maria:
Oh! I forgot to bring the restoration gel!

Maria:
We still have to try out the new gauntlet... The match is coming up soon, isn't it? I'll head back to the workshop now!

Maria:
(Margaret... Those are some serious injuries...)

Maria:
(But...)

Maria:
Hm? What's that noise?

Nightmare Knight:
......

The Nightzmora drags his weapon across the floor, sending tiny sparks everywhere.

Enraged, he mutters to himself. He has made his way here following only the smell of the light.

Maria:
—Aaah?!

Nightmare Knight:
Ngh...

Nightmare Knight:
You... You are not her... Right, you are her sister.

Nightmare Knight:
Where is she?

Maria:
—! You want Margaret! Why?

Nightmare Knight:
Our battle has not yet ended.

Maria:
But the match's over!

Nightmare Knight:
The match...?

Nightmare Knight:
My Khaganquest's purpose is not a mere match in a competition.

Nightmare Knight:
The Radiant Knight is an essential part of this path... Our holy battle should not have been interrupted!

Maria:
Then you just have to defeat the Blood Knight and fight my sister the next round—

Nightmare Knight:
Enough!

Maria:
Gah!

Nightmare Knight:
Competitions... The Major... They are all for show.

Nightmare Knight:
You heard the rules, you heard the crowd! Couldn't you feel how laughable and blasphemous it all was?!

Maria:
—!

Is this the Major? What is it you won? What did you get from all this?

Glory, wealth, your family's honor, but what is it you're missing...? Hm, what is it you're missing?

And without much time to think about it, as if in pure response to the cheering all around her, Maria holds her sword up high.

Only the pain, sharp, radiating from her hand, overcomes the applause.

Nightmare Knight:
Do not take me for a jester entertaining the masses!

Nightmare Knight:
I am a descendant of the Kheshig. I must complete my Khaganquest!

Nightmare Knight:
Stand aside, I have no interest in frail children! The only business I have is for the Radiant Knight—

Maria:
No...

Maria:
I won't let you pass.

Nightmare Knight:
You...?

Nightmare Knight:
You are nothing but an affinity of the Radiant Knight.

Maria:
A... An affinity?

Nightmare Knight:
Your dream is taken from another. Your conviction is borrowed.

Nightmare Knight:
You use your young age as an excuse for your confusion... but what point is there?

Nightmare Knight:
The world can laugh at the Radiant Knight's stubbornness, but no one may refute the strength in her actions.

Nightmare Knight:
Yet you... you are not even a knight.

Maria:
......

Nightmare Knight:
Now stand aside, lest my blade slice your throat open.

Maria:
No.

Maria:
I won't let you see my sister.

Nightmare Knight:
Is she hiding? No... With her brilliant light, the Radiant Knight is above that...

Nightmare Knight:
Then... is she injured?

Maria:
—!

Nightmare Knight:
You mean to tell me I injured her in our fight, and I must wait until she recovers before our next match?

Nightmare Knight:
Shameless!

Maria:
Nngh––!

Maria:
(So heavy—That's heavier than Tytus's lance strikes!)

Nightmare Knight:
......

Maria:
Haahh... haaahh...

Maria:
Why am I...

Nightmare Knight:
Look at you... already drowned in fear...

Nightmare Knight:
You cannot wield your weapon in front of me. If we had met on the battlefield, you would already be dead.

Maria:
No...!

Maria:
This... has nothing to do with knights.

Maria:
I just want... to protect... my sister—

Nightmare Knight:
The Radiant Knight is not for you to protect, you ignorant pegasus...

Nightmare Knight:
Guh!

Nightmare Knight:
This arrow... A far cry from that blue archer.

Old Knight:
Step away from the child, Nightzmora.

Nightmare Knight:
Batbayar...

Nightmare Knight:
Will you stand in my way too?

Old Knight:
Maria! Quick, stand up! Come over here!

Maria:
R-Right!

Old Knight:
Are you nuts?!

Nightmare Knight:
This is not the first time you asked me this question.

Nightmare Knight:
I thought... at least you would...

Old Knight:
You have nowhere to go, kid.

Old Knight:
Tell me, where is your Khagan?

Old Knight:
Where is the Kheshig's banner? Where are their tents?

Old Knight:
It's been a thousand years... Why live in that past? Why chase that tradition?

Old Knight:
What can all that bring you, kid?

Nightmare Knight:
......

Tola.

Your name means 'grasslands.'

You must take pride in your bloodline.

Whensoever and wheresoever you stand, you must take pride in yourself.

Tola.

You must live as a normal Kuranta. This is very simple.

Study, grow up, learn a trade, and marry a beautiful wife.

Nightmare Knight:
......

Nightmare Knight:
Batbayar, I made up my mind when my mother died to the fangs of a wild beast.

Nightmare Knight:
It was this nightmare of mine... that made me a Nightzmora.

Old Knight:
What kind of nonsense are you on about—

Nightmare Knight:
I have struggled for years... in this country of knights.

Nightmare Knight:
Yet, in the end, I was guided to this path to fulfill my last ideals.

Old Knight:
Hold on... hold on.

Old Knight:
You can't seriously mean... your journey was all for—

Nightmare Knight:
Speak no more.

Nightmare Knight:
You are old and frail, but it does not change the fact you once stood on the battlefields. If you insist on standing in my way...

Nightmare Knight:
Then I shall trample upon you and destroy one of my last remaining blood kin with my own hands.

Nightmare Knight:
Come. I shall charge you.

Old Knight:
What—

Maria:
Master Vogelweide—Get out of there!

Old Knight:
Maria, are you okay?!

Maria:
I-I'm fine.

Maria:
We can't let this lunatic find Margaret... Or else—!

Nightmare Knight:
You would stand in my way... So you will kill me?

Nightmare Knight:
Do knights of Kazimierz truly know what it means to fight to the death?

Nightmare Knight:
No, you cannot possibly. Batbayar, you are old. And you, naive pegasus, you know nothing of the cruelty of the world.

Nightmare Knight:
You would interfere in my fight with her. You are sullying both our names and honor.

Maria:
No!

Maria:
Honor doesn't matter at all!

Nightmare Knight:
—Then what does your sister fight for?!

Nightmare Knight:
You dare spout such blasphemy?! You dare claim the Radiant Knight vies for the Major's title not to regain her glory?!

Maria:
*Whimpers*...

Nightmare Knight:
You heretic! Raise your weapon! You will pay the price!

Maria:
I... still won't let you pass!

Maria:
Ever!
