Margaret:
Ngh...

Margaret:
Candle-flame... and shadows.

Candle Knight:
What a surprise... You seem to have a good inductive reasoning of Arts phenomena.

Candle Knight:
When a room is illuminated by only a single candle, the candlelight will naturally draw our attention more so than anything else. Yet it is the shadows of everything around that truly engulf us.

Margaret:
Impressive techniques, Viviana... Not even my light... can shine upon you.

Candle Knight:
Please allow me to apologize.

Margaret:
What...?

Candle Knight:
Out of courtesy, I should call you by your name too, Miss Margaret.

Greatmouth Mob:
Is... Is this really the a knight competition?!

Greatmouth Mob:
It looks like neither of the knights are in a rush to slaughter her opponent for a win. On the contrary, you could say this scene is like an elegant aristocratic social gathering!

Greatmouth Mob:
B-But even so—Did you see those Arts?! The Candle Knight's lightning-quick swordhand! Did it just engulf all that light?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Is the Radiant Knight's endless radiance starting to wear thin?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Just a small candle-flame—That's right, it's just a tiny candlelight, but check out its surroundings! The flame is engulfed by the darkness around, and it's that unlit darkness, not the candle's light, that's drawing our attention!

Greatmouth Mob:
Rather than that tiny glow, you could say the Candle Knight is controlling the shadows underneath that light!

Greatmouth Mob:
Gotta hand it to them! This isn't something you often see in our matches, not even the finals!

Greatmouth Mob:
Their Arts are calm and elegant, but there's no mistake that these Arts are of the highest caliber!

Greatmouth Mob:
That's the Radiant Knight, Margaret Nearl, and the Candle Knight, Viviana Droste, we know and love!

Zofia:
Maria? Maria!

Zofia:
Where is she...? She's not at the bar, and she's not home...

Zofia:
......

Zofia:
No...

Maria:
Nnf... nnf...!

Maria:
Why am I...?

Platinum:
......

Maria:
You...? You're that...

Platinum:
The Armorless Union.

Maria:
......!

Platinum:
Oh, calm down.

Platinum:
As long as you promise you won't make a fuss, we won't do anything to you.

Platinum:
After all, if the Nearl family's precious little baby got hurt... the Radiant Knight and Młynar wouldn't just sit around and not do anything.

Maria:
You want to... make Margaret forfeit?

Platinum:
Something like that.

Platinum:
Do you know what happened to Brassrust? The Infected are the talk of the town right now.

Platinum:
Could you imagine what would happen if, under these circumstances, the Radiant Knight ends up taking the crown?

Platinum:
Your sister just has to be a good girl and let the Candle Knight win. That will save us all the headache. Pretty simple, don't you agree?

Maria:
......

Maria:
Margaret isn't going to forfeit.

Platinum:
......

Platinum:
Did you know, Maria Nearl?

Platinum:
Kazimierz... is like a tower. If you stand at its base and look up at the top of the spiraling staircase, you will never, ever see its end.

Zofia:
V! Kowal! Marcin!

Zofia:
Maria might've been—

Młynar:
What happened to Maria?!

Spokesman McKee:
Why don't you try your hand at writing a few poems? With how popular you are, I can get in touch with a few publishers. Your fame and talent will...

Candle Knight:
Me...? I'm afraid... I can't.

Spokesman McKee:
You're being humble again.

Candle Knight:
No, this isn't humility, McKee.

Candle Knight:
I...

Candle Knight:
...Margaret.

Candle Knight:
When you set a tall, magnificent spire ablaze, how far away can the masses see the smoke?

Margaret:
Flames cannot burn away the contradictions in their hearts.

Candle Knight:
......

Margaret:
The masses can see the black smoke from far, far away, but it may once have been their homes, the lands on which they survived.

Candle Knight:
In that case... I truly don't understand.

Candle Knight:
How does a knight like you return to Kazimierz, if not for a change of heart? What is your objective?

Margaret:
It's just as you said, Viviana.

Margaret:
The times are changing, but that does not mean what we once considered virtuous and righteous must change.

Margaret:
I came back because I must remind the knights of Kazimierz... as well as all those who are here in this country—

Margaret:
—I'm here to remind them of their long forgotten glory.

Candle Knight:
Remind? How will you... remind Kazimierz of anything, given its current state?

Margaret:
You want an answer from me... but I'm afraid I don't necessarily have that right. This isn't something that can be done through simple conversation.

Candle Knight:
My... You can read minds with your Arts?

Margaret:
I'm only grasping more and more of your honesty by the minute.

Margaret:
Also, you asked me what I saw in my years of exile.

Margaret:
I've witnessed... the greatest tragedy this world has seen.

Margaret:
I've seen the Infected's struggles at death's door, I've seen great cities crumble and fall as Catastrophes rained down upon them.

Candle Knight:
Is that the suffering you've seen...? In this world that you pity...?

Margaret:
I have excellent companions.

Margaret:
No... excellent doesn't adequately describe them anymore. They... possess a brilliant shine, a testament to their ideals.

Margaret:
It's true. I was once lost, Viviana.

Candle Knight:
Anyone would be lost if they had taken the crown and been exiled at your age.

Margaret:
But things are different now. At the end of my long journey, I found friends whom I can trust. I realized where my beliefs lie.

Margaret:
I'm alone no longer.

Margaret lodges her longsword into the ground.

Without a sound, the knight's radiance emanates throughout the arena, with gold seemingly flowing through her eyes.

She will be the lighthouse and foundation of everything here.

She will stand solemnly in this place till she ceases, perhaps even till the end of times.

Even if no one has walked the path she alone illuminates—

—There is nothing to fear any more.

An Armorless Union Member:
Report. Platinum, ma'am... We've already informed the Knights Association.

An Armorless Union Member:
However, the match is still ongoing.

Platinum:
I sure wish the Knights Association would get on with this already. Otherwise, her sister's going to have to suffer.

Maria:
I told you. Margaret isn't going to forfeit.

Platinum:
No biggie. I'm sure she won't be in any mood for her next match when she sees your fingers laid out side by side at your family's front door.

Maria:
......

Platinum:
Look at your eyes... So defiant. You're a weird one. No, both you and your sister are weird.

Platinum:
You may come from a famous line of heroes, but do you know how many lackeys the General Chamber has here in the Grand Knight Territory?

Platinum:
So you have the Radiant Knight and Młynar. The two of them together might put up a little fight, but what can they really do? Can they really take on the thousands of assassins here in the GKT and escape legal liability?

Maria:
I don't remember you being such a talkative gal... Are you nervous?

Platinum:
Maybe.

Platinum:
I mean, before, all I had to do was draw my bowstring, aim, and let go. Then, my target would die after a quick flash of pain.

Platinum:
These orders I've been getting, though? Not only do I have to go after kids now, I also have to arm wrestle with the Radiant Knight. *Sigh*... Work sucks.

Platinum:
The Armorless Union's really gone to hell lately, hasn't it?

An Armorless Union Member:
Report!

Platinum:
Did the Radiant Knight give up?

An Armorless Union Member:
No, it's just... E7 and E9 didn't answer during the regular check-in just now...

Platinum:
Why are you standing there, then? Get ready to fight.

Platinum:
All units, deploy immediately. Secure vantage points A1 and A2. Do not give the target a chance to escape.

Platinum:
Numbers three and four, cover me. We'll deal with the infiltrators.

Platinum:
(An explosion? They aren't the least bit worried about the hostage, are they—?)

Platinum:
(—No, that's not right. They're not here to rescue Maria.)

An Armorless Union Member:
Hostiles in the smoke! Watch for attacks—

An Armorless Union Member:
Nngh–...

'Justice Knight':
(Loud clicking noises)

Platinum:
What's this...? A delivery cart?

Platinum:
—!

Iwona:
Well, hello, Armorless lackeys.

Platinum:
Grr... Infected knights, huh...?

Iwona:
Whoa, huge backflip. Look at that distance. You're a nimble one—Hm?

Iwona:
Maria Nearl? What are you doing here?

Maria:
It's... it's you...

Iwona:
Hey, can you move?

Maria:
Y-Yes!

Iwona:
I don't know what's going on, but I ain't about to complain if this means the Radiant Knight's gonna owe me a favor.

Iwona:
Let's get this out of the way first. It's a serious crime to assault the Armorless Union. Haha, not in the legal sense, but whatever.

Iwona:
You can run away if you want, or—

Maria:
—If I don't stop them here, they will keep going after my sister.

Platinum:
......

Iwona:
Whew, not a bit of hesitation. I'm starting to like you.

Iwona:
Too bad, though. I'm not gonna have it on my conscience to drag anybody into our fight against the Armorless. Besides, I get the feeling Sona's pretty fond of you. You'll have to do this another time!

Iwona:
Toland!

An Armorless Union Member:
W-What?

Maria:
Huh? Who are you?!

Toland:
Come with me, will you, Young Lady Nearl? Oh, and by the by? You and your uncle are nothing alike.

A Kazimierz Knight:
Report to the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi... It's confirmed. The Armorless Union and the Infected knights' skirmish has begun. Maria Nearl's been taken away too.

A Kazimierz Knight:
It will do as long as the Radiant Knight's match goes uninterrupted. Over.

Greatmouth Mob:
How long has it been since the match started? No one in the arena today has ever seen two knights duel like this!

Greatmouth Mob:
Even Arts laymen can tell right away theirs are on another level!

Greatmouth Mob:
This is a battle of lights! There's no doubt this has become the theme of this match! A weak candlelight versus a full-blown radiance!

Greatmouth Mob:
Up till 9 o'clock, we've had two million viewers watching this match via the intercity net and other means!

Greatmouth Mob:
For the first time since the 22nd Major, when the Radiant Knight took her title, we've broken the highest concurrent viewer record! There are countless viewers watching Margaret's heroics right this moment!

Greatmouth Mob:
Ah, what a shame! I wish we lived in one of those sci-fi novels where fans from all the other countries could watch this match live—Ahhh!

Greatmouth Mob:
The giant rays of light clash again—How blindingly bright! But amidst the rolling waves of light—That's right! The Candle Knight remains unscathed!

Margaret:
Phew...

Margaret:
Brilliant... Viviana.

Margaret:
With light and shadows... you weaved an untreadable swath of land.

Candle Knight:
I am honored that my little candle-flame could hold the Radiant Knight down for so long.

Candle Knight:
But you don't seem to be giving it your all. Are you perhaps worried about your family?

Margaret:
......

Candle Knight:
What are you doing is contradictory, Margaret.

Candle Knight:
You take pride in having such wonderful companions, but the course that you have charted for yourself... will cause you to leave your friends behind.

Candle Knight:
Perhaps one day, your sister will meet her fate in one of the Armorless Union's conspiracies, and the General Chamber will stand in your way, wherever you will be.

Margaret:
Viviana.

Margaret:
When the knight charged toward the endless waves, did you imagine that he was trying to overcome the entire world?

Candle Knight:
Ahh, so you are familiar with that knight legend.

Margaret:
My sister's a big fan of the book.

Roy:
Centaurea's been ambushed by the Infected. It was Wild Mane.

Monique:
If she can't take care of the likes of Wild Mane, then she should hand in her resignation already.

Monique:
That said... What should we do? The K.G.C.C. made it clear they want the Infected dealt with... and as soon as possible.

Roy:
Hmm... They are quite a pain in the rear... but we need them to keep stirring up a ruckus for us...

Monique:
You're our star performer. It's your call.

Roy:
Oh? Was that a compliment? You know, I've always thought that I look kinda like some star out there, ever since I dyed my hair blue.

Roy:
Okay, okay, stop glaring at me like that. It's very simple. Kill a few of them, and as cruelly as possible, too. Spread the fear.

Roy:
The ones left behind will come to hate Kazimierz and the K.G.C.C. even more, and things will only get more intense.

Monique:
So?

Roy:
Eh, so, let's dump all the troublesome mess on our little Platinum.

Roy:
Let's kill some Infected. The ones who aren't knights or in the limelight. Just the perfect amount of cruelty, like we're hunting them down.

Margaret:
...Huff...

Margaret:
I see, so the moment your candle goes out is when you actually start casting.

Margaret:
Even a brief moment of darkness is enough to swallow my Arts whole. In that case, perhaps you can engulf the entire arena's light with each flicker of your candle's flame?

Candle Knight:
Impressive observation. There has never been a knight who saw through my Arts during a duel. Is this the result of your years-long exile?

Margaret:
Too bad, then. It seems I have yet to truly make contact with you.

Candle Knight:
I used to hate Arts more so than anything. The more outstanding my Arts are, the more I am reminded of my upbringing—

Candle Knight:
And the more I come to realize... the situation I am in.

Candle Knight:
Tell me, Margaret Nearl, the Radiant Knight. Each and every knight who keeps the faith feels particularly curious about you.

Candle Knight:
Tell me your answer. Your answer of what it means to be a knight.

Greatmouth Mob:
—Both the Radiant Knight and the Candle Knight have stopped. They're cautiously sizing each other up, taking a stroll around the arena—

Greatmouth Mob:
What's the matter? Is this a tea party to the two of them? Are the two knights going to share a dance together after all that careful probing?

Candle Knight:
Hoh, did you hear that? He said we could dance.

Margaret:
Please, then.

Like the gentle morning sun, her beaming radiance begins to extend its reach toward the candle-lit darkness.

Soon after, the light begins to flood the entire arena.

Kawalerielki tonight is as brilliant as any bright, clear day.

An Armorless Union Member:
The Nearl girl went this way, didn't she? Quick, find her!

An Armorless Union Member:
—There's no one here!

An Armorless Union Member:
How can that be?! This place's listed in her file! It's Tremoriron Knight's bar!

An Armorless Union Member:
Check if there's an attic or an exit out back—

Bald Marcin:
Misters, I'm afraid we're not open right now.

An Armorless Union Member:
Don't you dare!

An Armorless Union Member:
Erk...

Old Craftsman:
Don't you kill them, V. Not unless you want shit to really hit the fan.

Old Knight:
Hah, how about you have a guess at how many artillery casters I captured during the war all those years ago to earn my military honors?

An Armorless Union Member:
Son of a...! How dare you?! We're—

Bald Marcin:
The Armorless Union? How about before that? Were you a robber? A bounty hunter? A veteran, or perhaps a down and out knight?

Bald Marcin:
Let me tell you. We aren't scared of you.

An Armorless Union Member:
You dare cross the Union even once, the Union will hunt you to the ends of the world.

An Armorless Union Member:
It might happen today... maybe tomorrow. It might happen when you're eating, when you're asleep, or when you're spreading marmalade on your toast... You'll have nowhere to run!

Old Knight:
Thanks for the advice. *Spit*.

Old Knight:
To be honest, though, the Armorless ain't nearly as scary as the vanguards.

Old Knight:
Hah! I haven't felt as good as this in years!

Old Craftsman:
Looks like their buddies are on to this... Sorry, Marcin, but that might be it for your shop.

Bald Marcin:
Oh, that's too bad. I paid two years' worth of rent upfront.

An Armorless Union Member:
You! What have you done?!

An Armorless Union Member:
You dare resist—Form up, ready your crossbows—Uh?

The Armorless points his crossbow forward.

The bowstring has snapped. More accurately, it is being twisted.

An Armorless Union Member:
W-What?

Old Craftsman:
Take this!

An Armorless Union Member:
Ugh?!

Bald Marcin:
It's been a while since I used any Arts... Guess I've gotten rusty.

Old Knight:
Hmph, since when did the Armorless have this many men?! The K.G.C.C.'s got too much money to throw around, huh?

Old Craftsman:
Hah, that's why we wiped the floor with all of them!

An Armorless Union Member:
Watch out! The bald guy's Tremoriron Marcin, and the other two are campaign knights!

An Armorless Union Member:
Keep two squads here. Keep them alive. They will be our trump card against Nearl. The rest of you, find Maria—

Old Craftsman:
Hey, this isn't looking good, V!

Old Knight:
You want to try begging for mercy, then?

An Armorless Union Member:
Ready, fire—

An Armorless Union Member:
What? Who is it this time?!

Zofia:
You...

Zofia:
What have you done to Maria?!

Radiance. The word 'radiance' is starting to be wear on everyone in the arena.

The sun-like prismatic colors dye the area behind the Radiant Knight. Standing opposite her is a small candlelight that has lit anew.

Then, right when the audience is starting to grow tired of finding the two knights in the blinding glow...

The faint sphere—Its rays, its halos, and all its light blink away.

Margaret:
*Pant*... *pant*...

Margaret:
Viviana... You are truly impressive...

Margaret:
Look, my light... have been swallowed whole... *Pant*.

Candle Knight:
I'm honored to have exhausted the Radiant Knight.

Candle Knight:
But it seems you rely on more than just your dazzling Arts.

With her Candle Sword held up high, the Candle Knight begins to steadily lower her blade.

The candle's flame has extinguished, leaving behind a glistening brilliance on its milk white cross section.

The candle, now halved, flutters down toward the earth like a feather.

Candle Knight:
You've broken my blade. It seems I have lost.

Candle Knight:
I, The Candle Knight, Viviana Droste, admit defeat.

Greatmouth Mob:
The Candle Knight has conceded! I didn't hear that wrong, did I—? The Candle Knight has just accepted defeat! The committee has confirmed her request. So there you have it—

Greatmouth Mob:
After this excruciating, protracted duel, the winner is our young legend, the Radiant Knight!

Greatmouth Mob:
The Radiant Knight, suddenly returned from exile, has defeated her first Grand Knight opponent after an extraordinary match of the highest level!

Greatmouth Mob:
The Candle Knight may have suffered defeat, but there is no doubt she is basking in glory! The two knights are shaking hands and trading salutes! Take a good look! This scene is going to be all over the headlines the next couple weeks!

A Spectating Knight:
What?! The Candle Knight lost?! That's a couple months' paychecks down the drain!

A Cheering Knight:
Serves you right for not listening to me... Not that I earned much myself, but well... *Sigh*... This match's probably giving me some kind of eye disease down the line.

Margaret:
Hnnf...

Candle Knight:
To be a knight is to be the noble light that illuminates the land...

Candle Knight:
Hmm...

Margaret:
Viviana.

Margaret:
I won't comment on your background—and that matter that weighs on your mind. However, you are among the strongest knights I have ever met.

Candle Knight:
That is more than enough.

Candle Knight:
In the classic knight tales... the knights always opened their hearts to each other by crossing swords.

Candle Knight:
Reality has proven to be less romantic. Though I've only just met you today, Margaret.

Candle Knight:
Show me how far you will go.

Candle Knight:
I'm looking forward to seeing.

Iwona:
Tch—

Iwona:
(—I managed to block that strike, but I still almost lost my grip on my weapon—She's tough—)

Platinum:
My next shot will pierce through your legs. You won't be able to run anymore.

Platinum:
The next shot after that will pierce through your armor.

Platinum:
The final shot will blow right through your chest. You'll struggle in agony for a moment, before dying in the dirty, wet street.

Iwona:
Hah... No wonder Sona told me to run as soon as I ran into an Armorless elite.

Iwona:
You've really hit it big for someone your age. Bet the people higher up the ladder there are some serious monsters, eh?

Platinum:
You'd better pray you never find out—Hm?

An Infected Knight:
Wild Mane! We'll cover you! Get out of here!

'Justice Knight':
(Hurried beeping noises)

Iwona:
Alright, Justice, if that's what you say. Today's not the day for us to settle the score with the Armorless anyway.

Iwona:
See you next time, Platinum!

Platinum:
*cough*, *cough* *cough*...

Platinum:
She's gone.

Platinum:
What's her deal with explosives...?! *Cough*, there's ash everywhere... and I just washed my hair.

Platinum:
*Sigh*... How am I supposed to explain this...?

Roy:
No need to explain anything.

Roy:
We saw all that.

Platinum:
......

Monique:
A fair number of the Infected just now are part of the Pinus Sylvestris.

Monique:
They banded the Infected together fairly quickly. Since when has the Grand Knight Territory had this many Infected?

Roy:
If we have to play the blame game, I guess that's on both the sloppy engineering contractors and the Catastrophes.

Roy:
That's why we need Area 0 to do its job... Oh.

Roy:
Little pegasus? I have a favor to ask you.

Platinum:
Ask away... I just screwed up in front of my bosses. I'm not about to object.

Roy:
Will you investigate this company for us? They have dealings with the Radiant Knight, and they are in Area 0 right now.

Roy:
We'll take over this whole thing about the Infected... And this company has to do with the Radiant Knight anyway. I'd say it falls under your purview.

Platinum:
Rhodes Island.

Platinum:
I just need to investigate?

Roy:
They were even gung-ho enough to get in touch with the General Chamber. Man, it looks like this foreign company is extra greedy.

Roy:
If they prove beneficial to us, then they can do whatever they want. I'll even be okay if they end up solving the Radiant Knight problem with money.

Roy:
But this whole affair is up to the Board of Directors. Somebody there will come looking for you soon. No need to worry about what we think.

Platinum:
What will you two do, then?

Monique:
Since when have you had the right to question the Lazurites' business?

Platinum:
I... I wouldn't dare.

Monique:
Now do your job.

An Audience Member A:
It's the Candle Knight! Please sign this for me!

An Audience Member B:
Candle Knight! Look this way, please! Ah—!

Candle Knight:
......

Spokesman McKee:
You look like you're in a good mood.

Candle Knight:
Did you know, McKee?

Candle Knight:
I heard that the Radiant Knight's legend as the youngest ever champion ended with her exile.

Candle Knight:
She was infected and then exiled, but it wasn't until I met her six years later that I realized this: They are all tall tales.

Candle Knight:
Just now...

Candle Knight:
...she was as radiant as the sun at high noon.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Phew... That was a pleasant meeting, Dr. {@nickname}.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm sure you've gained the favor of the top brass. Those were all key members of the General Chamber of Commerce.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
But my guess is... You are seeking more than just a mutual relationship on paper, right?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm curious... are there many researchers familiar with the battlefields of commerce in other countries?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Haha...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Your hotel isn't much further.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Oh, this is pretty close to where I got my first job. Back then, I was just your average trader—

An Infected Knight:
Urghh—

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
—! Step back, Doctor!

An Infected knight, injured from unknown causes, turns to your face with a stupefied look.

You can tell that there is not a hint of anger, fear, or sorrow in this man.

But you have not had the chance to truly analyze his complex emotions. Right now, he is like a burdenbeast being flogged.

The man strenuously climbs to his feet and runs away.

An Infected Knight:
......

An Armorless Union Member:
Mr. Spokesman, this is...?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Who was that just now?

An Armorless Union Member:
An illegal Infected. If you would like, we can send you the documents later.

An Armorless Union Member:
I apologize. Even though you are a spokesman, I can't divulge more when there is an outsider in your presence.

An Armorless Union Member:
Please take your friend and evacuate immediately. There's been a confrontation in the neighborhood.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
My apologies. I hope that didn't dampen your spirits.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I didn't expect we would run into trouble like that after the banquet...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm afraid I don't have that power...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Malkiewicz looks silently in the direction the Infected knight ran away.

There is a small alleyway, from which he can hear music playing and see waves of heat wafting out of a midnight diner.

The knight's blood trail extends into the distance.

Like gemstones sparkling with humanity.
