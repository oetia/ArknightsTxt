Iwona:
......

Justyna:
Welcome back, Iwona.

Justyna:
You look like murder.

Iwona:
No shit I do.

Iwona:
Didn't get to mangle every last inch of those knight sons of bitches' armor... grr.

Justyna:
It wasn't your fault.

Justyna:
He didn't tell any of us how bad it'd gotten.

Sona:
With an infection like that, he should've stepped aside months ago.

Sona:
He should've found his way out of Kazimierz, followed his dreams. Should've gotten to sort out his final days.

Greynuty:
Olmer Ingra... the Kawalerielki knight noble to a T. Despotic, ignorant, no regard for human life.

Greynuty:
I should've broken all four of his limbs in the arena when I had the chance...

Justyna:
It's not your fault either, Ashlock.

Iwona:
Dammit. And I was right there!

Sona:
Did he... say anything... in his final moments?

Iwona:
You wouldn't want to know.

Sona:
On the contrary, I wish I could.

Iwona:
Fine.

Sona:
......

Greynuty:
It's not rare at all... for Infected to pass on with regrets.

Greynuty:
We'll remember his anger.

Sona:
......

Greynuty:
Sona?

Sona:
His name was Jamie. He was a competition knight, and then an Infected after an accident.

Sona:
He went through a divorce. He had a sweet little girl. He must've been underreporting his condition so he could keep on competing... He needed the money.

Justyna:
But in order to underreport his condition, he'd have to bribe the Knights Association.

Justyna:
I found the letters between him and the Association staff in his room. It was a bottomless pit.

Sona:
He was the optimistic type. So optimistic to the point he couldn't even tell the sort of burden he was shouldering.

Sona:
He caught Oripathy, he parted ways with his wife and daughter, but he kept on helping people.

Sona:
Do you still remember? He was always up at the crack of dawn just to look after the kids.

Sona:
He shouldn't have died in this indignity. It goes against the founding intent of our Knightclub, but...

Sona:
But I can't get over it...

Sona:
It was the end of the end, and someone so filled with passion for life, in his final moments, let loose such haunting, unforgettable hate.

Sona:
If this is how things are—

Greynuty:
...Sona.

Greynuty:
You've had too much on your mind lately. Careful you don't get so fixated.

Justyna:
...Mm...

Iwona:
...I'm gonna leave all this knotty thinking work to you guys.

Iwona:
I'm gonna get stronger. Strong enough to crush those sanctimonious bastards between my fingers. Strong enough to clear the way all by myself.

Iwona:
The Blood Knight's a fine example. Since at least Kazimierz recognizes a 'knight' these days, that's the path we should be take.

Iwona:
Don't overthink stuff, Sona. It'll only slow you down.

Justyna:
...Sona!

Sona:
Alright, alright, I get it. We need to step it up and check with Szewczyk—

Justyna:
The wind... there was a change in the wind's stirring. Even if just for a moment...

Justyna:
Someone's watching this place, and not just that...

Sona:
The Armorless?

Justyna:
They know how to mask their breathing. But if they're after us, they should've attacked by now.

Iwona:
—Come out.

Iwona:
This is Infected territory. No uninfected would ever just wander in here.

Iwona:
If you don't—

Toland:
Alright, alright. Keep the noise down, sheesh.

Toland:
Never dreamed I'd see Infected knights around. I haven't been anywhere near Kawalerielki in over ten years, but the knight bosses and businessfolk are all out of their minds.

Greynuty:
Who are you?

Toland:
Don't get me wrong, I was in the neighborhood looking for someone. But, well, this might just be meant to be...

Toland:
...I'm thinking we share some of the same interests, my Infected friends. Like... the Armorless Union.

Sona:
Sorry, but we've been through some very unfortunate things today. If you really want to chat, try some other day.

Toland:
Oh? That's some rotten luck indeed. My condolences.

Toland:
Then I can only go somewhere else and try my luck there. Not every day I visit the Grand Knight Territory, after all.

Toland:
I'll leave you all be, then... but we might see each other again very soon.

???:
......

???:
I found the knight who took Szewczyk. The runaway Fartooth Knight.

???:
She's mingling with Pinus Sylvestris, of course. Infected knights have a way of sticking together—

???:
—What's that noise on your end? Are you at a bar again?

???:
Fine, looking into the Nightzmora's background, that's a decent excuse. When's the order being issued regarding the Infected?

???:
...What?

???:
Didn't the Szewczyk case end up like this precisely because they were 'still officially meeting to decide?' They sent a whole drone to bomb him—what point is there in still...

Roy:
Well, jeez... tell me all you like, but the Major's running right now no matter what you say. They can't be all that cavalier about deciding.

Roy:
Yep, mm-hm, I'm not slacking one bit, trust me.

Roy:
It's true—hey, boss, you got any fries?

Bald Marcin:
One moment.

Roy:
Cool. Hey? Monique, you still there?

Roy:
...Classic, she hung up.

Bald Marcin:
Here's your fries, sir.

Roy:
Oh, nice. Appreciate it.

Roy:
Mm...! Who's the genius who came up with slicing a tater this thin and frying it too? The world wouldn't be so beautiful without you, whoever you are.

Roy:
Come to think of it, that real standout Maria Nearl, she graces this place pretty often with Whislash Knight, if I'm remembering right?

Bald Marcin:
If you came looking for an autograph, you'd better be extra lucky.

Bald Marcin:
After all, this bar's for nothing but old retired fogies.

Old Knight:
Who's that there? Couldn't be an Armorless Union spy?

Old Craftsman:
God knows, he hasn't tried anything. Not like we can frisk him, either... hey, is he sizing you up?

Old Knight:
Hrrm... just ignore him.

Old Knight:
I've been getting the twitchiest eyes since last night... Can't shake the feeling something big's going to happen.

Old Craftsman:
Finally hit the right age for insomnia?

Old Knight:
Eh? I'm fit as a fiddle! What do you know! It was the twitches back then that told me we had incoming artillery fire—

Old Craftsman:
What the hell big's going to happen to you? Are you going to squeeze olive oil out of your toothpaste tomorrow morning?

Bald Marcin:
—Hmm.

Old Knight:
Marcin. I can sense their aura now... it's someone major.

Bald Marcin:
I've never had a premonition strange as this before... here's hoping they won't make trouble.

Roy:
(Here they come. Nice and fast, too... mmm, I'll just let it happen.)

–– (Ancient language) The young hunter sets out on his Khaganquest ♪

–– (Ancient language) From dreams he goes, towards the shores of gold ♪

Old Knight:
(This language...!)

Old Craftsman:
What's going on? Kids these days wander into bars singing their own songs? What's the point of the jukebox, then?

Bald Marcin:
The Nearls' light can't really have stuck to my lonely little bar, can it? But I've never met a knight like you in my time... V? What's wrong?

Old Knight:
I... I don't know, it's just suddenly my heart feels a little...

???:
(Ancient language) ...Batbayar, brethren, the last descendant.

???:
(Ancient language) Why be in a place like this?

Old Knight:
You...! You know that name?

???:
......

The silent knight looks around. Where his gaze touches, the light hides.

Old Knight:
Answer me. How do you know that name?

Old Craftsman:
Hey, V, this a friend of yours?

???:
......

Bald Marcin:
Would you like a drink? Sir? If you've got no business, I have to tell you we don't welcome armed knights too warmly here.

???:
(Ancient language) How sorry this is.

Old Knight:
Hold on, don't just up and go—

Zofia:
Kowal, Maria will be borrowing your workshop a while longer—

Zofia:
—Er.

Maria:
Zo—Zofia, slow down... agh!

Maria:
Why did you—stop, what's going on?

???:
...You are...

Zofia:
...Nightmare Knight?

Zofia:
What's the rising star of the year doing here? Are you trying to sneak out intel on Maria and Margaret?

Zofia:
If so—

Nightmare Knight:
How clamorous.

Zofia:
—!

Maria:
Watch out!

Maria:
Wh... What are you trying to do here!?

Nightmare Knight:
Pegasus... a weak race. Only those pegasi with blood of flowing gold are worthy rivals.

Nightmare Knight:
But once the pegasi abdicated, this so-called 'Land of the Knights'...

Nightmare Knight:
Its grasslands turned feeble. You cannot be blind to it, can you, Kuranta?

Nightmare Knight:
In present Kazimierz, you people, all are called knights?

Nightmare Knight:
And in those... pompous arenas, you test your martial skills?

Bald Marcin:
After your little act just now, I'm not finding the will to talk to you all nice and happy.

Old Knight:
Hold it... boy, I still have things to ask you. The last thing I want right now is to put a bolt through your head.

Nightmare Knight:
Not bad... you have the will to fight still.

Nightmare Knight:
What about you, then?

Roy:
Uh, me? Like, me? I'm just a fan of knights, just in the neighborhood. No need to waste the effort pretending I exist, I'll be fine.

Roy:
I can't do a thing anyway, not a single thing, mm-hm.

Nightmare Knight:
......

Roy:
(Tremoriron Marcin, proficient with warhammers. Vogelweide, campaign knight marksman. Whislash Knight, not much of a threat since she was injured... Maria, no need to monitor for the time being.)

Roy:
(But none of that really matters... mm-hm... the Nightzmora came looking for Vogelweide after all...)

Roy:
(Alright... now... what to do. Will the Radiant Knight come?)

Nightmare Knight:
This place is not worth even a quick visit. Keeping company with you people makes one uneasy to stand still.

Old Knight:
Alright, boy, who d'you think you're looking down on?

Nightmare Knight:
(Ancient language) Batbayar, in the past you campaigned on the battlesands, fought with your own two hands, yet could only barely manage to protect your homeland.

Old Craftsman:
(What's he saying?!)

Old Knight:
War... you're a campaign knight? You recognize me?

Nightmare Knight:
(Ancient language) No, I'm no 'knight.' Nothing so ridiculous. Simply put, war is the only path in which you never shamed your ancestry, descendant.

Nightmare Knight:
(Ancient language) Though you stand here... in this city of steel and concrete, neon flitting through the rain, descendant, I hope you can still remember the breathing of the grasslands, and the vow the Khagan swore.

Old Knight:
Khagan? What...?

Old Knight:
You're going on about some stodgy old tale?

Nightmare Knight:
(Ancient language) I intended... before setting out once again, to seek my surviving brethren in this so-called land of the knights. It seems, now, I was simply deluded.

Nightmare Knight:
(Ancient language) No matter.

Nightmare Knight:
(Ancient language) Kazimierz's frailty spits on Khagan's accomplishments. Someone must set such conduct straight.

Old Knight:
Stop right there! You still haven't answered me!

Nightmare Knight:
Hm... Though now you've lost all that made you, you're still at least half a brother... I should answer your question.

Nightmare Knight:
It was an old veteran who told me your name, and he, he was ruined in his age, not even able to run.

Nightmare Knight:
I seek every one of my brethren in Kazimierz. No matter how weak their relation, I seek them and nothing more.

Old Knight:
Come again? Brethren? In Kazimierz, is that right?

Nightmare Knight:
It's no longer your concern, Kazimierzian.

Zofia:
Hold it.

Nightmare Knight:
......

Zofia:
Nightmare Knight... I've heard plenty about the badly-behaved newcomer you were.

Zofia:
You should've known we wouldn't let you go so easily after you kindly brandished your sword at us.

Zofia:
How about you take off your helmet and we have a nice chat?

Nightmare Knight:
'Nightmare'...? Ah, the title those city slaves plastered on me without permission?

Nightmare Knight:
Ridiculous... that knights are so obsessed with these names now...

Nightmare Knight:
It is only their inherent beliefs, and desire to grasp destiny, that urge knights to embark on their journey.

Maria:
...!

Zofia:
The Knights Association won't be happy to look the other way with you picking arguments like this. Do you want to be stripped of Major qualifications?

Nightmare Knight:
If... only vapid knights like you remain in Kazimierz... then I really am wasting my energy. What harm would losing worthless qualifications be?

Nightmare Knight:
However, this pegasus by your side... seems to very much resemble someone I wanted to find...

Maria:
What?! You mean... my sister?

Maria:
—What do you want with the Radiant Knight?

Nightmare Knight:
What I want...? Look at all the Grand Knights Kazimierz elevates as champions—if there remains any opponent worth conquering in this present country, I fear it may be among them.

Nightmare Knight:
Of course... it may also happen that they're all disappointments.

Old Knight:
You've gone mad, haven't you. You came here just for a fight?

Nightmare Knight:
(Ancient language) Mad?

Nightmare Knight:
(Ancient language) Yes... the people who choose to live in the Kazimierz of now often tell me so...

Nightmare Knight:
(Ancient language) ...which is why we are no longer brethren.

Zofia:
I said stop! Are you just leaving like nothing even happened?

Nightmare Knight:
Given this endeavor is fruitless, I have no need to stay...

Nightmare Knight:
Goodbye, descendant.

Zofia:
Grr...

Zofia:
What in the world was wrong with that man, all high and mighty...

Zofia:
I can only hope Margaret doesn't meet him in the arena.

Bald Marcin:
Seems he came for a quick look at you, then? Is he from your home place?

Old Knight:
......

Old Knight:
He's... a Nightzmora?

Old Craftsman:
What? There's still Nightzmora alive today?

Old Craftsman:
Here I thought they were all in legends, or they were holing up in Sargon or some sort.

Old Knight:
......

Old Craftsman:
So what? What's someone from your grandpa's grandpa's side doing finding you?

Old Knight:
...He's calling to us.

Left-hand Knight:
...Tch.

Greatmouth Mob:
Oh! Oh! This is history, being made before our eyes!

Greatmouth Mob:
Can 'Left-hand' Tytus Topola lead the Bladehelm Knightclub in a breakthrough here, and return to his spot as one of the top sixteen tyrants?!

Greatmouth Mob:
This battle reeks of revenge! All of you watching! I hope your blood's on fire! He's fallen short of the Final 16 over and over, but today, will 'Left-hand' Tytus Topola have what it takes to overcome himself?!

Greatmouth Mob:
It all comes down to one thing—his opponent!!

Greatmouth Mob:
In the long and storied history that is the Topola family's knightly record, only one time! Only one opponent! Has brought such colossal shame!

Left-hand Knight:
Damn you...

Left-hand Knight:
What have you been doing, all these years?!

Left-hand Knight:
(Why... to hell with this...)

Left-hand Knight:
(How do I fight now? Do I make some room? No, she... hff... why is she using a swordspear, of all the things...)

Left-hand Knight:
(Most important...)

Margaret:
......

Left-hand Knight:
(...is that she... somehow has me... pressured?)

Tytus Topola shuts his eyes.

He considers this a scene of impassioned vengeance, a long-brewing opportunity to prove his worth.

But all his resentment, visions and fervor, have here and now vanished like smoke.

He cannot help but concede, this is no standoff.

Only a challenge.

A challenge, striding for the pinnacle.

Left-hand Knight:
(Since I became the Bladehelm Knightclub's frontman, when was the last time I felt like this?)

A challenge, an advance, climbing to an ever higher domain.

Left-hand Knight:
Hah... heheh, it makes me want to laugh...

Left-hand Knight:
The Radiant Knight, are you truly the same woman?

Left-hand Knight:
To force me back to this degree... and yet you don't feel a hair of pride, not a drop of excitement? Where did the mettlesome you of yesteryear go?

Left-hand Knight:
Look at you now, so serene one could gag—

Margaret:
I don't mean to look down on you, Tytus. I never have.

Margaret:
However, you've already lost your way.

Margaret:
In the hunt that was the melee, at least, you were the last one standing. You forced your way free on nothing but a single arm like you had originally done, imbued purely with the desire to win.

Left-hand Knight:
Hahah... you've even learned to preach, now? Could it be? Your days of banishment have made you the lecturesome kind?

Margaret:
...Tytus.

Margaret:
Why would you let those logos bind you?

Left-hand Knight:
—Listen, Radiant Knight!

Left-hand Knight:
Weren't you always prattling on and on about those rancid traditions... urging us to—use the most traditional methods to decide victory?

Left-hand Knight:
A charge, a skirmish, an all-expending effort.

Left-hand Knight:
I will trample... all that you are!

Greatmouth Mob:
Left-hand Knight is composed and steady! Does he plan to decide this with one final plunge?!

Greatmouth Mob:
And the Radiant Knight is—now the Radiant Knight's slowly raising that bizarre weapon—

Greatmouth Mob:
Who will be stand victorious after this final clash? What are you waiting for, audience?! You have the power to show your support for these knights, so do it—!

The Candle Knight:
......

A Passing Tourist A:
Is that the Candle Knight, Droste? What's she here for?

A Passing Tourist B:
Maybe she's waiting for someone... quit staring, hurry up and sneak a picture... who knows if we can hit on some major scandal...

The Candle Knight:
......

An Arena Worker:
The Candle Knight! Madam, I'm very sorry to leave you unattended. Are you looking for someone?

The Candle Knight:
It's alright, it was brash to come without notifying anyone. I just wanted to take a look at how the Radiant Knight cuts her figure.

The Candle Knight:
After all, I imagine it's almost over.

An Arena Worker:
Yes, Left-hand Knight Sir Tytus Topola lost ten minutes ago to the Radiant Knight. Sir Tytus has incredible strength, but he can't be too hopeful after falling into the losers' bracket in the first round.

The Candle Knight:
Indeed.

An Arena Worker:
Did you... really come just to meet the Radiant Knight?

The Candle Knight:
I want to see. See just how different she is now, compared to what I've heard in the rumors of knights.

The Candle Knight:
All the crowd's gone rushing over.

An Arena Worker:
R—Right. Actually, ever since the Radiant Knight officially returned to competition, she's barely cooperated with our standard service activities.

An Arena Worker:
She constantly leaves arenas without saying a word, and scheduled interviews and all sorts of PR items get rejected. It really makes your head spin.

An Arena Worker:
Though actually, I think there's even more reporters mobbing the Radiant Knight than usual today. I wonder what that's about?

Margaret:
Ah... sorry, can you just let me through...

An Excited Reporter:
Miss Margaret, what are your views on the Infected knight who passed away on the field? Will this affect you in any way?

A Pushy Reporter:
Madam Radiant Knight, do you have anything to say about the Knights Association's recent decision? Can infection actually contribute to an unfair playing field?

An Excited Reporter:
Ah, Miss Margaret, is it possible to reveal anything about the state of your infection? Can you confirm if the Knights Association's measures to keep it confidential are a disservice to the spectators and the other knights?

An Excited Reporter:
There are reports of you getting close to a few Sarkaz women! Who are they to you? Give an explanation, please!

A Pushy Reporter:
Madam Radiant Knight! Please respond—do you intend to become the spiritual leader of the Infected knights?

A Pushy Reporter:
—Will you be the second coming of the Blood Knight—

Margaret:
I won't be answering your questions.

An Excited Reporter:
Can we take that as an admission? Then what relation do you and those Sarkaz—

The Candle Knight:
Well met, Madam Nearl.

Margaret:
And you are...?

An Excited Reporter:
The Candle Knight, Droste! The Candle Knight was waiting outside the arena for the Radiant Knight!

A Pushy Reporter:
Give the schedule printout to me... that's right, they'll meet each other on the field... hey, get a snap of this, quickly! Snap it!

The Candle Knight:
May we... walk and talk?

The Candle Knight:
(I presume you don't want the media haranguing you any longer, either?)

Margaret:
Ah... yes.

Margaret:
Right then. Let's go somewhere else.

An Arena Worker:
I'm sorry, please keep your distance—the press conference will be held at a later time, please can everyone just be patient for now! Patience, please!

The Candle Knight:
......

Margaret:
Now then...

The Candle Knight:
You've been through a lot, legend of Kazimierz.

The Candle Knight:
Your banishment has conversely cast much of a veil of mystery on 'The Radiant Knight'... the holy, haloed knight, the awe-inspiring golden pegasus, the hero who returned like a shooting star...

The Candle Knight:
I saw as I came close today, you were still very young, and disconcerted by such a sudden situation... Margaret Nearl, this is the real, living person.

Margaret:
Come what may, I thank you for helping me just now.

Margaret:
I assume you're a knight too, though I don't believe I know you?

The Candle Knight:
It's been a while since someone asked me who I was. More than who I am, they care who they wish I was.

Margaret:
Er, I'm very sorry. I haven't been back in Kazimierz for too long...

The Candle Knight:
...Heheh.

The Candle Knight:
Are you concerned that because you don't recognize me... I may fly into a rage?

Margaret:
I can tell, you're quite unlike anyone else.

The Candle Knight:
My, now, thank you for the praise.

The Candle Knight:
I'm very pleased myself to get to know such a Radiant Knight. My name is Viviana Droste.

The Candle Knight:
Or perhaps, you may also call me The Candle Knight.

Margaret:
The Candle Knight... no, Miss Droste, thank you once again for your help today. Were you seeking me for any reason?

The Candle Knight:
Before long, we'll face each other on the field.

The Candle Knight:
You are an Infected, and one who was once met with banishment. Make no mistake, I have no habit of connecting with my opponents before a match.

The Candle Knight:
I come from Leithanien; I am an expatriate, living in this bustling city under an identity I could never imagine.

Margaret:
Kazimierz's recognition is already yours, Miss Droste.

The Candle Knight:
I hear the Radiant Knight never approved of the current system of knighthood, and so, you were consequently banished. Do you still feel the same way?

Margaret:
The knights of Kazimierz are forgetting their obligation as we speak.

Margaret:
Have you ever been to the most destitute corners of Kazimierz? Conflict, starvation, infection... the common person suffers enormously, while the knights hide in their cities, making great shows of peace and prosperity.

Margaret:
The spirit of knighthood is almost completely lost. It's a legacy for capital to wantonly toy with.

Margaret:
How is it not a form of disgrace?

The Candle Knight:
...I see.

The Candle Knight:
It seems—it is you who stands as a true knight.

The Candle Knight:
But you are... still no more than a knight.

Margaret:
......

The Candle Knight:
How about your sister? She's been active on the field for the past while.

The Candle Knight:
Has she renounced... the path of knighthood?

Margaret:
............

Spokesman McKee:
Miss Droste... and Miss Margaret, good evening.

The Candle Knight:
Good evening, Mr. McKee.

The Candle Knight:
Thank you for tending to the commotion just now.

Spokesman McKee:
...*Sigh*. So you do have that much self-awareness...

Spokesman McKee:
With two Grand Knights such as yourselves, the masses could make each and every move a hot topic. Put the two of you together in front of the media...

Spokesman McKee:
But never mind all that, there's always some way to sort it out. Miss Droste, you should be preparing for your meeting with the Leithanian noble tomorrow.

Spokesman McKee:
If you would, I'd appreciate you avoid exacerbating uncertain factors for the next while.

The Candle Knight:
Such as, meeting with an Infected knight?

Spokesman McKee:
It seems the noble in question has come for your sake, Miss Droste. You have a celebrity status to the Leithanians too.

Spokesman McKee:
Mieszko Industries is very willing to assist them with construction planning in Leithanien, but the one putting the final seal on this trade contract is you, Miss Droste.

The Candle Knight:
Of course... it is my obligation.

The Candle Knight:
It seems I must apologize, Madam Radiant Knight, that I'm unable to continue my chat with you tonight.

Margaret:
It's alright. You gave me a pleasant surprise... that Kazimierz still has knights such as yourself.

The Candle Knight:
The next we meet will be on the field.

Margaret:
Yes.

Margaret:
I look forward to the day.

The Candle Knight:
A final word of advice... Madam Radiant Knight.

The Candle Knight:
The storm is nearing.

The Candle Knight:
The trails will be especially radiant in the starry sky, these coming days of ours.
