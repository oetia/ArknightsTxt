Jamie:
Don't kid yourself.

Iwona:
......!

Jamie:
Think of what we had to go through.

Jamie:
We had to fight wild beasts in the underground arenas, sometimes even our fellow men. We still carry the pain and scars that will never go away.

Jamie:
The bosses wanted more blood and excitement, they wanted us to throw matches, and do their shady bidding outside the arena. We had no choice but to do what they wanted.

Jamie:
What do you think all that was for?

Jamie:
Look at all those places outside Kawalerielki. Where do you think the Infected can go?

Iwona:
Where we can go...?

Jamie:
We have Oripathy, an incurable disease. We will die sooner or later, and when we do, we'll lay waste to whatever unfortunate patch of ground we collapse onto.

Jamie:
We are ominous, we are uncontrollable, and we are different. We are here to be despised.

Jamie:
Do you think the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi will really allow the Infected to start a proper knightclub?

Jamie:
Is there really room for the Infected to live in Kazimierz... no... anywhere in this world?

Jamie:
And even if there were...

Jamie:
...what does that have to do with you?

An Armorless Union Member A:
She's not moving... Is she dead?

An Armorless Union Member B:
I sure hope so. I don't really want to fight the Infected. I mean, what if we catch it?

An Armorless Union Member B:
Go take a closer look. If she's dead, we'll need the damage control team up here.

Iwona:
*cough*...

Iwona:
Who... are you calling dead?

Iwona:
C'mon!

Iwona:
You dirty... Armorless! I'll... take all of you down!

Iwona:
You murderers... You all have Infected blood on your hands!

An Armorless Union Member A:
She still has the strength to move...?

An Armorless Union Member A:
She's bloody all over. She can barely even stand. Just give up already.

Iwona:
Come on... Come at me!

Iwona:
None of you... are getting away... *cough*!

An Armorless Union Member B:
She's got backbone, I'll give her that. Let's show her some mercy. Finish her off.

An Armorless Union Member B:
I mean, she's going to bleed out in a few minutes. Man, Monique really knows what she's doing with those techniques.

An Armorless Union Member:
It's okay. It'll all be over soon—

All of a sudden, the Armorless stop what they are doing.

(Footsteps).

The footsteps are heavy, not like the light footsteps of these murderers, like whomever is making them is carrying a boulder that weighs a thousand pounds.

An Armorless Union Member:
(Muffled conversation)

Iwona:
(What are they... talking about...?)

An Armorless Union Member:
(Muffled conversation)

Iwona:
(...? Why are they...?)

Iwona:
No... Don't go... Stay right... where you are! I can still...

???:
Let it go, knight.

???:
You've done very well.

A Tourist A:
What's going on? Why is it dark all of a sudden?!

A Tourist B:
What's going on?

Greatmouth Mob:
Huh?! Is the power out all over town?! Lord, how much money are we going to owe for this?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Hey, you, the knight over there. Come help evacuate the audience!

Sona:
Phew.

Sona:
Whoa... It's pitch black outside...

Sona:
Are you sure you guys aren't overdoing it, Greynuty?

Sona:
Still...

Sona:
......

Sona:
The K.G.C.C.'s building has its own power source... Grr... We're almost out of time.

Sona:
Huh? Someone's here!

A Corporate Employee A:
Why did the power go out?

A Corporate Employee B:
Look outside! The whole city's—

A Corporate Employee A:
I-Is there a problem with the power plant again? Is this another Great Separation?!

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Calm down.

A Corporate Employee A:
Oh, Mr. Malkiewicz...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Fortunately, the spokesmen's meeting is today. The directors are all inside the Chamber building right now, safe and sound.

Spokesman McKee:
That's right. Follow instructions and help evacuate the crowds. Contact the Adeptus leadership. Our first and foremost priority is to make sure there isn't a lapse in public order.

Spokesman McKee:
Each district should have its own backup power source. Have the officers-in-charge make the necessary arrangements.

A Corporate Employee:
Yes, sir!

Sona:
The Board of Directors meeting...

Sona:
No, my priority right now is to find the machine room—

A Corporate Employee:
Lazurite, sir!

Sona:
—

Roy:
Well, things have gotten way out of hand...

Roy:
That's why I said we had to be more decisive with the Infected. We can't give them an opening.

Roy:
Lucky the directors summoned me here today. Who knows what could've happened to our bosses?

Spokesman McKee:
We'll review this series of events later.

Roy:
No problem, but most of the Armorless Union... and Monique are rounding the Infected up and snuffing them out right now. It might take them some time to get back...

Sona:
......?!

Spokesman McKee:
Very well... For the time being, please put your original mission on hold and ensure the directors' safety.

Roy:
Okay, though I... no one would dare go after the Board, right?

Sona:
Snuffing them out...?

Sona:
No... They'll be okay... I...

Sona:
I gotta hurry.

Justyna:
Please... Please be okay, Iwona.

Justyna:
Where are you?

Szewczyk:
Fartooth!

Justyna:
Plastic...?

Justyna:
Have you seen the others? They took out our comms—

Szewczyk:
It's not that simple. We're in the middle of the city. If they managed to cut off our comms, that means our channels were intercepted right from the start.

Szewczyk:
It wasn't Ashlock who took out the power either. The power plant went down before she could start her ambush. She's probably heading to where Flametail is right now.

Justyna:
What...?

Szewczyk:
The Armorless... They've been planning something, and they're passing the buck to the Infected—

Szewczyk:
Find the others! We're in real hot water right now!

Justyna:
Iwona!

Justyna finds the prideful Infected knight collapsed in a pool of blood.

Her armor is stained a gory red.

Justyna:
Iwona! Wake up!

Justyna:
—

Justyna:
S-She's still breathing...

Szewczyk:
......

Justyna:
Szewczyk, give me a hand—

Szewczyk:
Hold on... Has someone else... been here?

Szewczyk:
The Armorless assassins don't use axes... And even if they had an axeman, these marks...

Szewczyk:
The wall... is oozing blood?

Szewczyk:
It's him...?

Sona:
Download complete.

Sona:
So this is the plan for Area 0... and some sensitive information on the Armorless.

Sona:
......

Sona:
It feels weird being able to get my hands on this stuff so easily...

Sona:
Now let me get out of this stinking place—Argh, my tail—

A Corporate Employee:
What are you standing there for?! Hurry up and contact the National Council!

A Corporate Employee:
And you! Isn't your department supposed to help evacuate the Fireblade Arena? Get moving!

A Kazimierz Knight:
We'll escort the spokeslady. Is she on the second floor?

Sona:
(Things are a mess here... Perfect.)

Sona:
(I just hope I can get away without much trouble.)

Roy:
No way...

Sona:
(!)

Roy:
Did someone seriously sneak into the K.G.C.C. building during the chaos?

Sona:
(Did he see me—?!)

Sona:
Graah...!

Sona:
Owww... Where am I... Was I leaning on the door? I didn't even notice...

Sona:
It's dark. Uh, is this a meeting room...?

Sona:
I gotta find a way out—

Sona has always felt as though she is fighting against something.

Against the Armorless Union, against the General Chamber of Commerce, against all the injustices the Infected face, and against even fate.

She has never actually doubted whether her actions are necessary.

But, right this moment, she feels a chill reaching from her head all the way to her feet, causing her to waver a little.

Indeed, this is the first time she has ever wavered.

It's as though she's just seen a tremendous ice sculpture in the middle of summer.

Sona:
......

A call is coming in.

The ringing echoes throughout the empty room.

Sona:
Hello?

A Voice from the Phone:
Flametail Knight... Sona.

A Voice from the Phone:
I appreciate your efforts. Excellent work.

Sona:
Huh...?

A Voice from the Phone:
Right now, you have two options.

A Voice from the Phone:
'Lazurite' Roy is standing outside the conference room you are in, as we speak.

A Voice from the Phone:
This is going to be a very simple transaction. You are holding two storage devices.

A Voice from the Phone:
Hand over the one on the Armorless Union. You may keep the information on Area 0.

A Voice from the Phone:
That will be more than enough for you to bargain the right to a legitimate life from the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi.

A Voice from the Phone:
The way I see it, you have no other choice.

A Voice from the Phone:
Get a grasp of the situation, Flametail Knight. I have nothing against the Infected, much less you.

A Voice from the Phone:
Be it knights, merchants, or Infected, they are all narrow-minded.

Sona:
......

A Voice from the Phone:
Don't make an enemy of society, Infected.

A Voice from the Phone:
The server has already been destroyed. The chip in your hand is the very last copy.

A Voice from the Phone:
The choice is yours.

Sona:
............

A Voice from the Phone:
Perhaps you are thinking of smashing this telephone right now.

A Voice from the Phone:
Then do it... if you believe that's the answer to your revolt against fate—

Sona:
Whoa... He figured it out, huh? That's something.

Sona:
So, the Lazurite is right outside the door now. What do I do...?

Sona:
......

Sona:
Which floor is this again...?

Sona:
This... This is way too high, isn't it—?!

Greynuty:
Sona!

Sona:
Ashley, catch me!

Greynuty:
—What are you up to this time? Why are you up ther—Whoa—!

Sona:
Owww... Good thing I used Arts to soften the impact...

Greynuty:
......

Sona:
Wh-Why are you looking at me like that? Alright, no more wild moves... Now let go of my tail, will you?

Greynuty:
I'm glad... you're okay.

Greynuty:
Somebody took out the power plant before we could get to it. Whoever they are, they're using us.

Sona:
No matter... We have what we need.

Sona:
Ta-dah!

Greynuty:
This...? A small little chip like this... can change our fates?

Sona:
We'll just have to hope it can.

Roy:
Whew... That's gotta be at least a dozen meter jump.

Roy:
And look at you, still so full of pep, Infected. Haven't had enough yet?

Greynuty:
Hey! That getup...

Roy:
You know me?

Sona:
The Armorless Union keeps its top levels secret from regular old knights... But...

Sona:
'Lazurite' Roy. You're the only Lazurite assassin who hasn't been replaced in the past dozen-or-so years. There are all kinds of rumors centered around you. Of course we know you.

Roy:
Really? Haha, glad to know I'm famous. It's not necessarily a good thing for an assassin to be famous, though. I mean, the Armorless Union's not like you knights. We can't cash in on our fame.

Roy:
So, either you hand me the chip and walk out alive, or I kill you and take the chip myself.

Roy:
Personally, I'm not very fond of fighting to the death, especially when there's no money in it.

Greynuty:
Sona... are you okay?

Sona:
Phew, I'm fine. This is gonna be a tough fight, though.

Greynuty:
We just need to stay alive.

Sona:
Heh, how long has it been since the last time we fought side by side for real? Since our fight against the gloompincer?

Roy:
Come on, give me more credit than that. I think I can at least put up a better fight than a gloompincer.

Bald Marcin:
Good thing I have these emergency lights. I never thought they'd actually come in handy.

Old Knight:
What's going on? Another Great Separation?

Old Craftsman:
The power's really out for the whole town! What kind of sick joke is this? How could this happen while the Major's on?

Bald Marcin:
The power will be back soon... but... just who managed plunge a city that never sleeps into darkness?

Młynar:
......

Młynar:
Ridiculous... Just ridiculous.
