Maria:
Ahh!

Old Knight:
Kid!

Old Knight:
That's enough. Don't push yourself—

Maria:
No... Master Vogelweide... Look at your hand...

Old Knight:
This isn't the first time. I'm used to it.

Nightmare Knight:
It's over. Your strength is beyond my expectations. It was just enough to tide my anger...

Nightmare Knight:
You too are a descendant. I shall not take your life, but you will get out of my way.

Old Knight:
So you've got your heart set on dueling Margaret, huh?

Nightmare Knight:
Wrong. I am merely continuing a fight that was cut short.

Old Knight:
What do you want?

Old Knight:
You're stubborn and... mad. What are you looking for anyway? What is it that you actually want?

Nightmare Knight:
You do not understand...

Old Knight:
Like hell I would. For that so-called tradition of yours, you gave up your whole life and everything ahead of you! It's all pointless!

Nightmare Knight:
Did I need you to give my life meaning?

Old Knight:
I just don't want to see you stay on this path of insanity forever. The 'Khaganquest' is a coming-of-age tradition followed by a handful of tribes. Doesn't that make you still a child?!

Nightmare Knight:
Gah! I am done with you. Out of the way.

Old Knight:
Over my dead body!

Nightmare Knight:
—You will regret this, old man!

Nightmare Knight:
—!

Old Knight:
Maria, what are you doing?! You're hurt—

Maria:
This is my first time to see you so worked up, Nightzmora...

Nightmare Knight:
......

Maria:
The shield of a knight is meant to protect people. That's what my sister told me.

Maria:
You said my conviction was borrowed. I've got nothing to say about that.

Maria:
But if I'm going to be scared to walk even well-lit roads, then there's really no point in the knighthood anymore!

Nightmare Knight:
How dare you spout that nonsense about knights—

Maria:
—Sorry, but I'm not a knight anymore. I just want to protect my sister—

Maria:
I can't let a psycho like you get in her way!

Nightmare Knight:
Arts...? It's... Hm?

A ray of light shines off the blood on Maria's face.

Fragile and insignificant. It's true. If he gave it his all, the Nightzmora could easily have strangled the pegasus to death.

He is confident of that.

Yet... why does the blood on her face... have this radiant, golden shine?

Nightmare Knight:
Is it the light of the Arts turning it gold?

Nightmare Knight:
A pegasus whose name is bound to go down in history... yet so frail... Is it a mere coincidence?

Maria:
Master Vogelweide, go back without me... I'll hold him here.

Old Knight:
Drop the act, kid. He'll kill you—!

Maria:
Don't worry.

Maria:
I'll stop him!

Nightmare Knight:
......

Maria:
Huh...? Why are you turning around...?

Nightmare Knight:
...Pegasus.

Nightmare Knight:
You cannot grow stronger on the conviction of others. Not unless you truly believe in it.

Nightmare Knight:
And you do not.

Maria:
......

Nightmare Knight:
Dedication and sacrifice.

Nightmare Knight:
These virtues border on self-destruction... and you possess them at birth. You taught me a lesson, pegasus, descendant.

Nightmare Knight:
Perhaps...

Nightmare Knight:
...No, never mind.

Nightmare Knight:
Tell the Radiant Knight that my bout with her has not yet ended. I am merely putting it on hold.

Maria:
......

Perhaps? Perhaps what?

Perhaps I would have made the same decision if I had been raised in the same environment as you?

Never allow yourself to be so weak, Tola.

Never!

Gravel:
The Radiant Knight, the Blood Knight... The Major has really heated up in the blink of an eye.

Gravel:
If we go by points and nothing else, the finals should long have been in reach of the Radiant Knight.

Gravel:
Doesn't that make you happy?

Gravel:
You're right...

Gravel:
But even if the General Chamber is scheming something, I'm sure you and the Adeptus will help Nearl overcome.

Gravel:
That said, is the K.G.C.C. really the problem...? They're definitely not ones to do any work themselves. Instead, they prefer to sow the seeds... and wait for them to sprout.

Gravel:
Many will voice their gripes...

Gravel:
Hehe... but that also happened when the Blood Knight first came along.

Gravel:
But who still remembers any of that after the Blood Knight took his trophy and the money came raining down?

Gravel:
They have short memories, Doctor. No matter who ends up winning, as long as they speak on the Infected's behalf, it'll all work out fine.

Gravel:
Kazimierz loves its champions.

Gravel:
You mean... the Blood Knight? No, you wouldn't say something so skin-deep...

Gravel:
Whatever's the case, I believe you and Nearl will overcome.

Gravel:
They're giving the Infected knights checkups and treatment, just as always.

Gravel:
Rhodes Island is plenty efficient. I can see why the Grand Knight trusts you so much.

Gravel:
That said... I'm here right with you, and you haven't shown even a little bit of care for me.

Gravel:
That makes me kind of sad.

Gravel:
What are you thanking me for, specifically?

Gravel:
I'm just doing my job. I was given my orders, and I would go through fire and water to fulfill them.

Gravel:
I've only told you what the Grand Knight permitted me to say.

Gravel:
I'd love to accept your thanks, but it was her who truly helped Rhodes Island.

Gravel:
Oh... so our conversations are just a way to pass the time to you?

Gravel:
Hehe, but in that case, I'll keep talking to you all you want.

Gravel:
So, how will you thank me, Doctor?

Gravel:
Hehe... That sounds wonderful. I've always wanted to be a model, just once.

Gravel:
I may wear all this armor all the time, but I'm still a girl. I got tired of this outfit a long time ago.

Gravel:
That said... I didn't really have the right to think about something like this, in the past.

Gravel:
What I'm into...?

Gravel:
I've never thought about it before... What do normal Kazimierzian girls like? Food? Makeup? Oh... Let's not talk about knight stuff.

Gravel:
Well... as for outfits... All this armor does dampen my spirits every now and then.

Gravel:
Though a campaign knight like me doesn't really get much chance to wear regular clothes, either.

Gravel:
Doctor... do you know what you're saying? 'Anything you want' is pretty much the last thing you'd want to say when you're being interrogated.

Gravel:
Most of us hand our decision-making power away, probably because we find obnoxious to have to make decisions... but sometimes... the one we give that power may have some unexpected ideas.

Gravel:
Well, then, Doctor... Would you lean back, please?

Gravel:
Close your eyes, okay? I wouldn't want anything to happen to them...

Gravel:
And then...

Gravel:
Doctor, don't open your eyes.

Gravel:
If you see an Armorless assassin's face, I'm afraid you won't be leaving Kazimierz alive.

???:
......

Platinum:
You're not just a regular campaign knight, are you?

Gravel:
The Armorless Union doesn't hold the patent on assassination, you know?

Platinum:
Don't move, or I'll cut your throat open.

Gravel:
Now that won't do. I can't let you put the Doctor's life in danger, even if it costs me my own.

Platinum:
It's just some foreign company... Is this one really worth giving your life for, knight—Hm?

Platinum:
The barcode on your arm... You're a purchased slave. Why so loyal to an outsider?

Gravel:
Unfortunately, my desire to protect the Doctor comes from the bottom of my heart.

Platinum:
I see... The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi arranged for a lackey like you to follow Rhodes Island around. They planned to use Rhodes Island to investigate Area 0 right from the start.

Gravel:
Don't make our relationship sound so exploitative.

Platinum:
So you are Rhodes Island's 'Doctor.' There's supposed to be a Cautus girl around too...

Platinum:
I'm not into hurting kids. Bumping you off should do the trick, right?

Gravel:
Doctor, go on without me. I'll hold her here. Take Miss Amiya and leave this place. Look for someone from the Adeptus—

Platinum:
I'm not here alone.

Platinum:
The Armorless Union already has you surrounded... You're not walking out of here.

Gravel:
It's okay, Doctor... As long as I'm here, I—

Gravel:
—Doctor?

Platinum:
Shielding your own bodyguard? What's the idea? You'll give your life for someone else?

Platinum:
Aww, so cute... I've got a job to do though.

Platinum:
What...?

Platinum:
I don't know what you're talking about.

Platinum:
So?

Platinum:
Do you really understand what you're doing...?

Platinum:
Even with this campaign knight in the way, I can—

Platinum:
......

Platinum:
......!

Gravel:
A call...?

Platinum:
......

A Voice from the Phone:
Centaurea...?

Platinum:
......!

A Voice from the Phone:
No need to be so shocked, Platinum.

A Voice from the Phone:
I'm very glad you haven't killed Rhodes Island's leader yet.

A Voice from the Phone:
Call it off. Your orders were mistaken. Those morons, jumping the gun. It is not up to them to give the Union orders without consulting the Board.

A Voice from the Phone:
And stop the madness that Area 0 is pulling on its so-called useless Infected. Rhodes Island has opened our eyes. Their lives still have meaning... They can yet create value.

A Voice from the Phone:
That's all.

Platinum:
......

Platinum:
You... You planned this?

Platinum:
How did you do it?

Spokesman McKee:
So what will we do with Area 0...?

Spokesman McKee:
We'll be working with too many uncertain factors if we let the two Infected knights make a big splash after all the uprisings the Infected have instigated.

Spokesman McKee:
And if the public catches wind of the way Area 0 takes care of its Infected right now...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I suppose there are both upsides and downsides.

Spokesman McKee:
We don't permit 'both upsides and downsides.' Whether it's good or bad, what we want is control over the matter.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I have other ways to handle this...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Just to be safe, I've already instructed the Armorless Union to take care of it.

Platinum:
Should I let you go, just like that?

Platinum:
You're an outsider who knows about the Armorless Union...

Gravel:
Don't be such a sore loser, Platinum. You're embarrassing yourself, you know?

Platinum:
......

Amiya:
Doctor! I've got something to ask you about transporting today's supplies—

Amiya:
Hm? Do you have a guest? I-I'm sorry...

Platinum:
It's okay... Come in.

Gravel:
An Armorless and a campaign knight are having tea together because of you, Doctor. You're really full of surprises.

Amiya:
Um... Doctor, may I have a second? I need you to sign this...

Platinum:
(So that's Rhodes Island's leader... If I take her down now...)

Naturally, she is just entertaining the thought.

Even Gravel, who sits mere meters away from her, can feel not an ounce of hostility. After all, she is merely entertaining the thought.

Be that as it may, Platinum suddenly hesitates, before feeling relieved for her decision.

She is relieved that she did not carry out her mission.

In the blink of an eye, she senses a possibility in the petite Cautus.

If things escalate, will she actually be able to draw her arrow unscathed?

Or perhaps, before that—

Amiya:
Hm...? Miss? Is something the matter?

Platinum:
Never mind. Please excuse me.

Platinum:
I'll send someone to fix the glass I broke. Time to go.

Platinum:
The Doctor...{@nickname} of Rhodes Island.

Platinum:
I'll be back.

Amiya:
Doctor, Gravel... Did something happen?

Gravel:
No.

Gravel:
We had a cup of tea together. That's all.

An Armorless Union Member:
Platinum, ma'am... Here's what you wanted.

Platinum:
I'm surprised you found it.

An Armorless Union Member:
Right. We searched through the communications between Rhodes Island and the Adeptus, and we narrowed it down to this message with the clues we had.

An Armorless Union Member:
These are the true medical examination records of Operator Nearl... the Radiant Knight.

Platinum:
......

Platinum:
What...?

Platinum:
The Radiant Knight... isn't Infected?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Welcome to the Kazimierz Major! It's your old buddy, Greatmouth Mob!

Greatmouth Mob:
Thanks to Nightmare Knight's mistake, we're treated to today's matchup, the Blood Knight versus Nightmare Knight!

Greatmouth Mob:
With their terrifying auras, and might unmatched by any other, imagine the fight our mighty Blood Knight and the legendary Nightzmora have in store for us today!

Greatmouth Mob:
The Blood Knight and Nightmare had a fiery first encounter the other day! And now! They face each other in a formal match!

Greatmouth Mob:
There will be blood! There will be slaughter! Only the victor will get to bask in fame and glory. Let us welcome—our knights—for today's match—!

Margaret:
......

Nightmare Knight:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
No knightclub, no sponsors. Good lord, why are you people leaving that huge pie on the table?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Somebody, make him a knightclub! You'll be rolling in all the dough!

Greatmouth Mob:
On the other side, we have the king of blood, Kazimierz's Blood-Red Chalice, the heartless victory machine, and deservedly, the very pinnacle!

Greatmouth Mob:
THE—BLOOOOOD KNIIIIGHT, DIKAAAAIIIOPOLIIIIIS!

The Blood Knight:
We meet again... Nightzmora.

The Blood Knight:
Are you still searching for the shadows of the past?
