An Infected Knight:
Ugh, so do we all have to go to that Rhodes Island place for treatment?

Sona:
You don't 'have' to go, you 'get' to go. Just because you're used to living with Oripathy doesn't make it less dangerous!

Sona:
No matter how many things we still have to do, if our bodies fall apart first, what good are all those ideas?

An Infected Knight:
Well, you have a point.

Sona:
I sure do. Take care of yourselves. It's been a while since we've gotten any serious Oripathy treatment.

Sona:
We knights aren't the only ones affected either. There are still so many ordinary workers, farmers, and civilians with us... and we can't force them to suffer through Oripathy.

Sona:
We can't let what happened to Jamie happen to anyone else.

An Infected Knight:
Right.

Sona:
Phew...

Greynuty:
Sona.

Sona:
Oh, Ashley, what's up?

Greynuty:
We talked to that Sarkaz medic, Hibiscus. Rhodes Island has to leave the Grand Knight Territory this afternoon.

Greynuty:
We have a lot of people with us, so we need to get ready asap.

Sona:
Alright. Justyna and Iwona should be reaching out to the rest of the Infected who can still be contacted.

Greynuty:
The Armorless Union and General Chamber of Commerce really plan on giving up, huh?

Sona:
If what we learned is true, they should be a bit tied up right now with their own problems.

Sona:
And besides, Rhodes Island is still under the protection of the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi. At least for now... they're safe.

Greynuty:
......

Sona:
Hm? What'cha staring at me for?

Greynuty:
What did Toland say to you?

Sona:
Huh? Where did that come from all of a sudden?

Greynuty:
Ever since the two of you went to that village outside the Grand Knight Territory, you're like a completely different person.

Sona:
......

Greynuty:
Those villages on the outskirts of the Grand Knight Territory were established over the last few years in conjunction with the Kawalerielki Alliance. There shouldn't be anyone out there except a bunch of ordinary farmers.

Greynuty:
I doubt the bounty hunters have a foothold out there, so he must've had some other purpose.

Sona:
He entrusted us with a single task.

Sona:
Concerning Kazimierz, this country, the Infected, and all of us.

Greynuty:
Why didn't you tell me then?

Sona:
Ahaha... Honestly, I'm not sure why myself. It's been on my mind this whole time. Thought I'd tell everybody about it once I sorted things through in my own head...

Greynuty:
Hmph...

Sona:
A-Are you mad at me?

Justyna:
Then just come out with it.

Justyna:
Isn't that what you once said to me?

Iwona:
Haha. You don't even know how fidgety Greynuty has been the last few days. I kept having to tell her everything is fine.

Greynuty:
Pshh. No one here asks you to carry everything on your own, Sona.

Sona:
Sorry.

Justyna:
So, what's eating you up?

Sona:
......

Sona:
If what we are going to do next is at odds with the purpose we had when establishing Pinus Sylvestris... What would you do then?

Greynuty:
What does that mean?

Sona:
If we're no longer just fighting against the corrupt knights, against the K.G.C.C., no longer solely fighting for the benefit of the Infected––

Sona:
If we have to tolerate the discrimination against the Infected, join hands with former enemies, choose our fights carefully... If we have to completely change ourselves––

Sona:
––If we had to indefinitely set aside the peaceful lives just in front of our eyes, and leap into the fire again... What would you do?

Justyna:
......

Greynuty:
......

Iwona:
Ugh, what's with all these questions out of the blue? I'm not good with the philosophical stuff. What's the difference?

Greynuty:
How would you answer your own questions?

Sona:
As an Infected, as a knight, I believe... that we should strive to do more. Although right now... I don't know.

Sona:
But as 'Sona,' this isn't how I want to leave you all... Still, I'd rather that than force you down a path you never intended to take.

Sona:
And beyond that, nobody even knows where this path will lead.

Greynuty:
Sona...

Sona:
Um.

Greynuty:
I've seen you lost in thought a whole bunch recently, and it's made all of us uneasy. But I hope... I hope you understand one thing.

Greynuty:
Pinus Sylvestris may be the name of a knightclub, but we all know that even if we're knights, we also aren't really knights.

Greynuty:
Whether you're coming to us as a knight, as an Infected, as a Zalak, or even as just regular old Sona, you can always talk to us.

Sona:
Ashley...

Greynuty:
And, you'll get the same answer every time.

Greynuty:
We're not splitting up.

Justyna:
To be honest, after everything we've been through, I don't think there are any Infected in the knightclub who strictly identify as knights.

Justyna:
Of course, those who want to leave and pursue an ordinary lifestyle, we'll help them as well...

Justyna:
But that lifestyle isn't for us. Not the four of us.

Iwona:
That's right! If we were as mercenary as those guys, I would've waited all these years for nothing!

Greynuty:
What are you waiting for?

Iwona:
For a storm! So I can become the lightning!

Justyna:
If you like lightning that much, you should just paint your armor gold.

Iwona:
Woah... Great idea!

Sona:
Haha...

Sona:
Now that you've all made your feelings clear, let's focus on the issue in front of us!

Sona:
Let's get the Infected over to Rhodes Island! No rest till everyone's on board!

Sona:
We're going... to set sail soon.

An Infected Knight:
Flametail! Not everyone made it for the roll call! They must've been captured by patrolling knights!

Iwona:
Huh? Didn't they make everyone legal? Why are the knights still arresting people?!

An Infected Knight:
I-I don't know... Th-They said they're not releasing anyone without a ransom!

Greynuty:
Grrr... Corrupt nobles in need of some discipline... Sona.

Sona:
I know. Tell the others to keep to the plan and report to Rhodes Island. We need to act fast.

An Infected Knight:
A-Alright. What about you?

Sona:
We're gonna do what we've always done.

Hibiscus:
Uhh... Hmm...

Amiya:
Hibiscus, all these people...

Hibiscus:
I knew what was coming, but actually seeing this many at once... makes me wonder if we actually have the capacity.

Amiya:
It'll be fine. Doctor got some help from Mr. Malkiewicz.

Hibiscus:
Oh right, Amiya, I heard we were planning to open a new office in the Grand Knight Territory?

Amiya:
Ah... Yes. With how many Infected knights there are, we can't keep them all on Rhodes Island forever... Plus, there are still those Infected who we can't take care of, who still need a way out.

Amiya:
When the time is right, Pinus Sylvestris will help us establish a office.

Hibiscus:
How nice. They'll even get to see their homes again.

Hibiscus:
Was this that Flametail Knight's idea?

Amiya:
Not entirely. The Doctor also pitched in.

Hibiscus:
Aww, I really wanted to meet Flametail Knight. I heard she's done so many amazing things. Amiya, do you know why she isn't here yet?

Amiya:
Huh, now that you mention it... She was supposed to be here by now...

Shining:
Amiya, Hibiscus, it's time to go.

Amiya:
Oh, okay.

Amiya:
Shining, have you seen those knights from Pinus Sylvestris?

Shining:
From what the Infected knights told me, they stayed behind to help some Infected who were being harassed by knight-nobles, and were unable to catch up with the rest of the team.

Hibiscus:
Then, we need to go back them up––

Amiya:
Until we leave this country's borders, Kazimierz will continue to keep a close eye on us.

Shining:
Even now, dozens of campaign knights are waiting for our 'foreign enterprise' to leave the Grand Knight Territory.

Shining:
But...

An Infected Knight:
Sorry... I let my emotions get the better of me, and I got into a fight with that knight-noble.

Sona:
Don't worry about that now. Even if you hadn't overreacted, they would've found some excuse to torment you. Just grit your teeth and run!

Justyna:
Sona, we've got company. Not the knight-nobles. It's the Armorless Union.

Justyna:
They're tailing us from both sides, up on the roofs.

Iwona:
Aha, perfect. I was just about to feel guilty for not leaving them a parting gift!

Greynuty:
That makes two of us!

Sona:
No, we have to keep moving and get to Rhodes Island as soon as we can. We mustn't cause trouble for them.

Greynuty:
Sona?

Sona:
The Radiant Knight!

Margaret:
Hm.

Hibiscus:
A pillar of light?!

Amiya:
That must be Nearl, right?

Shining:
Yes... No doubt about it.

Shining:
None... at all.

Amiya:
Shining...

Hibiscus:
Ahh!

Hibiscus:
L-Look at that red-tailed Zalak running towards us! Is that the Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub?

Amiya:
Huh? Isn't the boarding ramp on this side though?

A Distant Voice:
Sorry I'm late, Miss Amiya–––

A Distant Voice:
Gangway! We're jumpin––!!

Amiya:
Wait, what? Are they actually going to––

An Infected Knight:
W-We're actually doing thiiiiis?! Woooah, that felt like a real heroes' entrance, right out of a novel.

Iwona:
Haha, piece of cake!

Greynuty:
I wouldn't have brought my shield with me if I knew this was going to happen... *cough* *cough*...

Justyna:
Sorry for dropping in unannounced.

Hibiscus:
......

Amiya:
Ah, it's fine...

Shining:
Long time no see, little knight.

Sona:
*huff* *huff* Heh, it wasn't that long ago.

Amiya:
Sona...?

Sona:
In the flesh! How've you been, Amiya? Should we get everyone introduced?

Czarny:
......

A Kazimierz Villager:
Good morning, Mr. Czarny. Why the formalwear today? Are you finally heading back to the city?

Czarny:
A very distinguished guest will be paying me a visit today. I've waited a long, long time for him.

A Kazimierz Villager:
Oh... What kind of guest? Is he also from the city?

Czarny:
He's... a former colleague.

A Kazimierz Villager:
I see, I see. I won't bother you anymore then. Just make sure to fetch the water before the sun goes down.

Czarny:
I will.

Czarny:
......

Czarny:
I'm also very curious what he's like now.

Czarny:
The last time we met... He was still a helpless little pen-pusher. So wishy-washy that he couldn't even speak up for himself. Didn't even have a single decent suit.

Czarny:
But now...

Czarny:
You've changed so much, Malkiewicz.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Mr. Czarny.

Czarny:
Come in.

Czarny:
I know you must have a lot of questions.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Czarny:
What, are you surprised that my house is so run-down?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The thing that surprises me more is how well you seem to have adapted to this life.

Czarny:
Haha... I'm sure that one day, the number of people in high positions solely because of their birth will become fewer and fewer.

Czarny:
Just look at your tone of voice now, Malkiewicz. You're more qualified for your job than I ever could've imagined. Congratulations.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I...

Czarny:
Before I found work in the Grand Knight Territory, I was just the son of a winery worker.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
That's quite different from what was on the resume you left in the office.

Czarny:
Oh... You even did your homework on me. See, Malkiewicz? I have a good eye for talent.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Czarny:
You are in peril, and you are powerless within the K.G.C.C., but you still managed to track me down and find my home, even after I completely changed my identity... You found me, Malkiewicz.

Czarny:
'I can hardly recognize you anymore.'

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......!

Czarny:
If you're going to be uncomfortable, at least try not to show it. It's bad for negotiations.

Czarny:
I am a branded criminal, and you... Well, the fact that you've come before me today without a completely new face means that you've risen through the ranks since the end of the Major.

Czarny:
Come, let us toast to your promotion.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Mr. Czarny, your exile was unjust.

Czarny:
Oh. You didn't come here just to tell me that.

Czarny:
The fact that you know the truth, about how I was treated... means that the people who told you this truth wanted something from you.

Czarny:
If I was in their position, I surely would've wanted 'Czarny' dead.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm not doing that.

Czarny:
Why?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
That goes against my principles.

Czarny:
Principles, hm? Do you not realize, the person standing before me, speaking so confidently of 'principles' was a pauper who couldn't even put food on the table just a few months ago.

Czarny:
Face it, Malkiewicz. You've already embraced this society. Sooner or later, you'll join its chosen.

Czarny:
Mmm... Quite a nice aroma to these two cups of wine.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
But I... don't think you should have to lose your life...

Czarny:
Platinum of the Armorless Union was just as naive and innocent as you, which is why I have my life. Of course, I think she only spared me out of convenience.

Czarny:
My family chose not to accompany me to this little village, instead continuing their comfortable lives in the Grand Knight Territory.

Czarny:
They divided up my assets, the Radiant Knight became the champion, and Czarny became a criminal. The Infected can never break the shackles of public perception–

Czarny:
––It proves I never misjudged Kazimierz. It is what it is.

Czarny:
Come, Malkiewicz.

Czarny:
This bottle of brandy was given to me by a former employee who I had promoted. He secretly sent someone to deliver this to me after learning that I was still alive.

Czarny:
Despite that, though, he still looted my ill-gotten 'bribes.' I had to pretend not to see that the necklace he was wearing came from my collection.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Czarny:
And this glass... is poisoned. But don't worry, I only just slipped in the drug. As long as you don't drink it, nothing bad will happen.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
––What's the meaning of this?!

Czarny:
Help yourself to a glass. I'll take the other one.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
No! This is ridiculous–– I'll be taking my leave!

Czarny:
Of course you can leave, Malkiewicz, but the end result will be the same. Oh, and don't try to throw out the wine either. Wine is very precious, but poison is plentiful.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Why... Why are you forcing me to do this? I don't understand! We only just met by chance during the Major––

Czarny:
Why?

Czarny:
Malkiewicz, have you really not figured it out yet?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Czarny:
Cheers, Malkiewicz. To your continued ascendance, and to... my retirement.

Czarny:
Cheers!

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
............

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

A Kazimierz Villager:
Hm? Are you Mr. Czarny's guest? Why are you here alone? What happened to him?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
What does Mr. Czarny... usually do around here?

A Kazimierz Villager:
Haha, that's a story to be shared over dinner! The folks from the city sure know their stuff. Most of the time he's helping the other villagers plan their business, or teaching the kids how to read and write...

A Kazimierz Villager:
What's wrong? Your face is all red... D-Did I say something to offend you?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
No, it's nothing.

A Kazimierz Villager:
Oh... Are you headed back then? S-Sorry to bother you.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I won't give in.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I won't become what you said, Mr. Czarny. I'll fight to the bitter end.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I swear it.
