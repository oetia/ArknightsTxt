Sona:
Ashley!

Greynuty:
Sona... Thank goodness you're okay!

Sona:
You fooled Roy, huh? What a performance. How did you pull it off?

Greynuty:
I just imagined how it'd feel if I actually lost you.

Sona:
Whoa, a method actor...

Sona:
Where are the others?

Greynuty:
Iwona's hurt. Bad... But she'll live.

Sona:
Iwona...

'Justice Knight':
(Dejected clicking noises)

Greynuty:
She's the one who fought most like a warrior... She stood firm to the very end.

Greynuty:
Justyna and Plastic's gone to deal with Platinum... We have to hurry and help them!

Plastic Knight:
No need. She's gone.

Plastic Knight:
We aren't so rusty that the two of us can't take her on. She's not that strong.

Greynuty:
Where's Justyna...?

Plastic Knight:
......

Spokesman McKee:
Today's matches must continue as normal. Is that understood?

A Corporate Employee:
We've made sure the Major competition venues are fully operational.

Spokesman McKee:
Good. Keep the spectators calm. Tonight's match must go off without a hitch.

Spokesman McKee:
Remember. It's not just the audience. After all that ruckus, the directors will be paying keen attention to this event.

Spokesman McKee:
If we perform well, we'll all get hefty bonuses. If not...

A Corporate Employee:
Understood!

Spokesman McKee:
And I appreciate your efforts, Mob.

Greatmouth Mob:
Don't mention it! I'm honored to commentate tonight—

Spokesman McKee:
I suppose it goes without saying, but pretend as though nothing had happened last night.

Spokesman McKee:
Of the four events tonight, the match between the Radiant Knight and Nightmare Knight would undoubtedly be the hottest one.

Spokesman McKee:
However... After the Infected instigated an incident of such scale... the Board of Directors isn't very keen on letting the Radiant Knight continue her streak.

Greatmouth Mob:
So... they want the judges to disqualify her?

Spokesman McKee:
We'll make a decision as the competition evolves, but you must 'convey' to the audience how reasonable it is once the judges make the call.

Spokesman McKee:
As for the Blood Knight, we've already sent someone to work this out with the Crimson Chalice Knightclub. We should come to a decision on that matter soon.

Spokesman McKee:
As for the matter on hand... the Radiant Knight and Nightmare Knight... They're just two maniacs.

Greatmouth Mob:
Understood! I'll head off and prepare for the match!

Spokesman McKee:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
What's the matter? You look pale.

Spokesman McKee:
Darksteel disappeared after the blackout. All three of them.

Spokesman McKee:
This is still confidential, but several of K.G.C.C. executives were assassinated during the blackout...

Spokesman McKee:
Things are hectic at the crime scene. All evidence points to the Infected, but... I don't think it was them. The Infected aren't that good.

Spokesman McKee:
As we speak... something terrifying is slowly unfolding.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You mean...?

Spokesman McKee:
Yes.

Spokesman McKee:
The Armorless Union has betrayed us.

Nightmare Knight:
Batbayar, do you always have so much free time on your hands?

Old Knight:
Look who's talking!

Old Knight:
Aren't you a titled Major knight? You have no training grounds. You don't have so much as a home. Do you seriously wander the streets of the Grand Knight Territory day in and day out?

Nightmare Knight:
When a hunter loses his way in the forest, he will naturally provide for himself and build himself a wooden shed.

Old Knight:
You are standing in one of the greatest cities of the world right now...

Nightmare Knight:
—City!

The unusual roar stuns the old knight.

Everyone in their vicinity are staring at them as though they are wild beasts of the forest.

Nightmare Knight:
The city... is a symbol of weakness.

Nightmare Knight:
Right after this civilization conquered barbarism, they built their tall towers here.

Nightmare Knight:
In these towers, humanity is no longer necessary.

Old Knight:
What are you even on about...?

Nightmare Knight:
Kawalerielki has warriors worthy of fighting. Here, they have warriors worthy of my trust.

Nightmare Knight:
Yet they are all resisting this city. The obedient are frail. The rebellious are eternal.

Nightmare Knight:
This is a symbol of civilization's corruption, Knight. We must return to those times of blood and glory.

Old Knight:
Son... You're living in the past.

Nightmare Knight:
I live in glory.

Nightmare Knight:
That era is not yet behind us, and I hope to experience it tonight.

Old Knight:
Well, I've got no more to say to you, then. Margaret will win.

Nightmare Knight:
She has the scent of a hero...

Nightmare Knight:
I only hope her talents have not been eroded by the hustle and bustle of this era.

Greatmouth Mob:
Welcome to the Kazimierz Major, and welcome to tonight's Kazimierz Major!

Greatmouth Mob:
As the events continue, we're getting bigger and bigger audiences joining us here in the arena!

Greatmouth Mob:
I'm honored to announce today that the cumulative spectator count and the total prize pool have once again pushed to the highest numbers in the history of the Major!

Greatmouth Mob:
There's no doubt Kazimierz has a bright future ahead!

Maria:
Can't I go to the arena to watch the match? Margaret should have gotten some tickets, no?

Zofia:
Silly girl. Do you want to be attacked by the Armorless again?

Maria:
Ugh...

Zofia:
We're openly standing up against the Armorless Union... Do you know what that means?

Zofia:
We have to keep a low profile. If we're going to fight them, we might not even be able to stay in the Grand Knight Territory.

Zofia:
Honestly... I really have no idea how things turned out this way.

Left-hand Knight:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Hmm... If this isn't...

Left-hand Knight:
Czarny's lackey, huh...?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Hello, Sir Tytus.

Left-hand Knight:
You can sit.

Left-hand Knight:
Becoming a spokesman has really lifted your spirits, hasn't it?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Not at all...

Left-hand Knight:
You were given those orders in such a perilous situation. Did you not find it all strange, under those circumstances?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Mr. Czarny left in such a hurry... There were a lot of things I never had the chance to ask him.

Left-hand Knight:
Do you want to ask him?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I...

Left-hand Knight:
I'm somewhat well connected with the K.G.C.C... If it pleases you, I can help you find out where Czarny was exiled.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Left-hand Knight:
Don't get the wrong idea. Losing to the Radiant Knight again proved to me that I'm not the Tytus Topola who defeated seven knights with one hand anymore.

Left-hand Knight:
Before I retire, I have to curry favor with you spokesmen... What's that look for?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
To tell the truth, I never expected this from a man of your caliber. You're the core of the Bladehelm Knightclub, once a top 4 hopeful, and a candidate for the title of Grand Knight...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I never imagined you would entertain the idea of retirement yourself.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
You are so... prideful in the arenas... I thought you would...

Left-hand Knight:
It's not easy to be a competition knight, Malkiewicz. Outside the arena, we're no different than you, and we need an exit strategy.

Left-hand Knight:
I'm plenty satisfied just to be able to fight this far with all four of my limbs intact.

Left-hand Knight:
The times for ideals are over, Malkiewicz.

Greatmouth Mob:
In tonight's match, not only will we get to see two of the biggest names in the tournament duking it out, but we have two independent knights facing off. We haven't seen a spectacle like this in years!

Greatmouth Mob:
No corporate sponsorship! No knightclub training or support! If they need their helmets polished and weapons sharpened, they have no one to rely on but themselves!

Greatmouth Mob:
Yet they both stand here today in the arena. And one of them is a former champion! All eyes are on our champ, eager for her return!

Greatmouth Mob:
Please welcome the young legend, the champion from the Nearl family, the Radiant Knight, MARRRGAREEEEET NEAAAAARRRLLLLLLL!

Margaret:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
And on this side, the descendant of a race left on the pages of the history books, a rare Kuranta, war-god scions who flay the years past—

Greatmouth Mob:
We could go through the entire history of the knight sports and find no one with purer blood, purer horror, and purer might than him!

Greatmouth Mob:
Now, here comes the lone wanderer from the grasslands, the last Kheshig, Nightmare Knight TOLAAAAAAAAA!

Nightmare Knight:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
What's this?! The Nightzmora's horn! The match is off to a fiery start! Will the champion fall to the ancient race?! Will this new conquest be cut short by the Radiant Knight?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Let us—

Nightmare Knight:
Radiant Knight.

Greatmouth Mob:
Ohh? Nightmare suddenly slammed his spear into the ground. W-What is he doing? Is he saluting his opponent?

Nightmare Knight:
I've been waiting for this moment... for far too long.

Nightmare Knight:
Kazimierz's knights have been a disappointment.

Margaret:
I've heard of you from Master Vogelweide, Nightmare.

Margaret:
What are you seeking?

Nightmare Knight:
I am seeking my fate, pegasus.

Nightmare Knight:
All who belong to my ancient race must set off on a Khaganquest when they come of age...

Nightmare Knight:
None of us know what awaits us during our Khaganquest, but it is only when our journey is at an end that our lives have truly begun.

Nightmare Knight:
Whether we fight fierce beasts or visit foreign lands, a Nightzmora who finishes his Khaganquest will know its meaning by the journey's end.

Nightmare Knight:
Then, we become plumules of terror itself, spreading fear as we make our way across the lands.

Nightmare Knight:
Only by knowing the world will we know our destiny.

Margaret:
Have you found your Khaganquest's meaning yet?

Nightmare Knight:
Not yet, Pegasus. The road ahead... is like a forest shrouded in fog.

Nightmare Knight:
I truly hope that you will be my meaning.

Nightmare Knight:
Come.

Justyna:
Are you Plastic's... Szewczyk's family?

A Quiet Woman:
Who are you?

Justyna:
I'm... a knight. A friend of his who's a knight.

Justyna:
Have you... been mistreated in any way at all?

A Quiet Woman:
Mistreated? I'm not sure I follow...

A Quiet Woman:
That day, a knight in white told me that Szewczyk was killed by an enemy he made in the arena.

A Quiet Woman:
After that, she brought us here, and we've been hiding ever since.

Justyna:
I got this from Szewczyk...

A Quiet Woman:
Oh! This is the wood carving I gave him.

A Quiet Woman:
Where is he? Is he doing okay?

Justyna:
I'll take you to him.

Platinum:
Let's make a deal.

Platinum:
As long as you can promise me that you will never again make an enemy of the Armorless Union, I can tell you where your wife is.

Plastic Knight:
What...?

Platinum:
And you, Fartooth. Convey this to everyone in Pinus Sylvestris:

Platinum:
There's been some issues within the Armorless Union, even I noticed.

Platinum:
No one wants to be used for no good reason. That obviously sucks...

Justyna:
Unbelievable.

Justyna:
Can you alone represent the will of the entire Armorless Union? I mean, you may be Platinum—

Platinum:
But I'm still only middle management, huh?

Platinum:
Yeah, that's the deal... Most of the Armorless were hired by the K.G.C.C. I'm only here to manage things for them... and no one can stop the Board of Directors's plans.

Platinum:
Still though, wouldn't things be a lot easier for you if us middle managers stopped doing anything?

Platinum:
After all, the Board has been pretty angsty lately, and our new recruits kinda subpar...

Justyna:
......

Szewczyk:
What's that? It was the Armorless who took out the power?

Sona:
Roy even wrecked the server room and laid the blame on us.

Sona:
Is the Armorless Union... trying to shake off the Board's control?

Greynuty:
Grr...!

Greynuty:
So we've been used, right from the start?!

Greynuty:
Our fight... our sacrifice... all of it—!

'Justice Knight':
(Dejected clicking noises)

Greynuty:
Sorry...

Sona:
No.

Sona:
After the Candle Knight rescued me, I ran into Ioleta.

Plastic Knight:
—The Grand Knight?! You met the Grand Knight?!

Sona:
Ahaha, she's a little younger and kinder than she seems on the papers and TV news.

Sona:
She agreed to give us all... the legal status we wanted. Our deal still stands.

Sona:
Ashley, do you have the chip?

Greynuty:
Of course...

Greynuty:
But, as things stand right now... the public thinks the Infected are the blame for everything that happened...

Greynuty:
Sona, does this 'legal' status actually... mean anything anymore?

Sona:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
Words can't describe how I feel right now—

Greatmouth Mob:
No doubt all of you are already familiar with the Radiant Knight's strength, but look at Nightmare Knight! See the stunning techniques this warrior of yore has in store for us!

Greatmouth Mob:
This is just unbelievable! Neither of them are using any serious Arts. This is a contest of pure combat and weapon prowess!

Greatmouth Mob:
This is more over-the-top than any action blockbuster I've ever seen. Look at their lightning quick moves, their powerful slashes! It's only been ten minutes, but the whole arena's already absolutely stunned!

An Excited Spectator:
Look! Check out Nightmare Knight's moves! He's on the same level as the champions!

A Rowdy Spectator:
I knew he'd be worth keeping an eye on! I spent four hundred on him!

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
What an extraordinary match.

Left-hand Knight:
I've never seen anything like the way the Nightzmora wields his weapon.

Left-hand Knight:
It's like the campaign knights' techniques, but also not quite the same... Hm...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
What's the matter, Left-hand Knight, sir?

Left-hand Knight:
Looks like we have an unexpected guest in the audience... The rumors from the other day are true, then.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
What do you mean—Ugh—!

A ray of silver light stands solemnly in the corner of the audience at the very back.

His presence may be matched by none, but even he is engulfed by the audience's cheers and screams.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
It's my first time to watch the Major up close like this...

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
It makes me want to vomit.

Ioleta Russell:
And what's so revolting about this, Liam?

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
......

Ioleta Russell:
I see. I know your answer now.

Ioleta Russell:
In that case, from your point of view, what do you think of these two knights in the arena, the Nightzmora and the pegasus?

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
I have to admit... their techniques are beautiful.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
The Nightzmora may not be a battle-hardened veteran, but a certain obsession has driven him to become a true warrior.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
As for Margaret... Hmm...

Ioleta Russell:
What's wrong?

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
I thought your eyes on this would be sharper than mine, Grandmaster.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
She's far too different... from what she used to be.

Margaret:
Haah...

Nightmare Knight:
Hff—

Greatmouth Mob:
The exhilarating exchange of blows has ground to a halt! This is the first time the storm of battle has paused!

Greatmouth Mob:
Don't these two need to breathe?! Are these moves even possible for mere mortals?!

Nightmare Knight:
Beautiful swordsmanship, pegasus.

Margaret:
Likewise.

Nightmare Knight:
You... excite me.

Nightmare Knight:
Did you know? According to legend, the Khagan once lost to a pegasus with golden blood, in his younger years.

Nightmare Knight:
I'm curious... Is there really a Kuranta in this world with golden blood in her veins?

Margaret:
Sorry to disappoint, but the blood on my face is red.

Nightmare Knight:
Warmup is over, Radiant Knight.

Nightmare Knight:
You live up to your name. And so—

The air is starting to freeze.

It isn't until the audience come back to their senses that they notice they forgot to breathe.

Is it fear?

Why are they afraid?

The entire audience... including all the knights feel a strange sense of repression.

Nightmare Knight:
—Let reality give way to me.

The Radiant Knight:
—

This is the first time Margaret has used her Arts subconsciously in the arena.

The intense radiance is almost like that of the sun, lighting up vast night sky.

Despite the blinding light, the young Nightzmora stands unflinching as ever.

Just as the name implies, a knight competition is nothing but a competition.

However, in this instant, Margaret feels something. It's the same aura that she has felt from her strongest enemies.

Catastrophes, the wails of the Infected, and their roars, the blood of the Infected, and their last struggles on the brink of death.

The young Nightzmora has never seen any mountains of corpses or seas of blood for himself.

Yet his lineage taught him how to control fear the moment he was born.

His pure lineage.

Nightmare Knight:
......

Nightmare Knight:
...(Ancient language) The young hunter sets out on his Khaganquest ♪ From dreams he goes, towards the shores of gold ♪

Nightmare Knight:
(Ancient language) A halberd in hand, stained red with blood of kin ♪

Margaret:
......

A tragic yet heroic song...

...telling an ancient story.

Nightmare Knight:
Hah!

Margaret:
—Ugh!

Greatmouth Mob:
Wh-What just happened?

Greatmouth Mob:
Some kind of Arts?! He used some Arts, and everyone in the arena is feeling a—uh, sensation, I guess!

Greatmouth Mob:
But! With a single step, Nightmare Knight roused up a blast wave that slammed right into the artificial boulders!

Greatmouth Mob:
What a fierce strike! The Radiant Knight had no choice but to fall back!

Greatmouth Mob:
A strike that pushes back a champion! A strike that dispels her light! Even the most radiant of lights cannot stop the Nightzmora's conquest!

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
There's no applause...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Everyone's immersed in... these emotions.

Left-hand Knight:
That strike...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Did you notice something?

Left-hand Knight:
Any other knight... would be dead by now.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Uhh...?

Left-hand Knight:
He's doing this for real.

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
......

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
He's the real deal...

Ioleta Russell:
Just a lost child.

Ioleta Russell:
Poor kid.

Ioleta Russell:
What's going on?

Greatmouth Mob:
(What?! So sudden? You sure? Uhh...)

Greatmouth Mob:
This just in! The Arts that Nightmare Knight just used have been deemed an adverse effect on our audience members and judges!

Greatmouth Mob:
This is a clear violation of Articles 3 and 7 of the Major's rules!

Greatmouth Mob:
'Competition knights may not harm or threaten the safety of the persons or property of the audience' and 'Competition knights may not in any way interfere with the judges' ability to make subjective rulings!'

Greatmouth Mob:
(Dammit, this is way too much of a stretch! Couldn't they have at least picked a better time?!)

Greatmouth Mob:
This match is now over—! So—

Nightmare Knight:
—Come!

Margaret:
Light...

Margaret:
Gather round.

Greatmouth Mob:
W-What's going on?! It's like the knights didn't hear our ruling!

Greatmouth Mob:
The match is over! Separate immediately and wait for the judges!

Nightmare Knight:
Hah!

Margaret:
—!

Nightmare Knight:
Ah! What beautiful swordhand!

Nightmare Knight:
In the blink of an eye... Right before my blade could slice your skull, you countered my attack...

Nightmare Knight:
You've witnessed death. You've witnessed cruelty. You tremble in the face of neither fear nor me!

Margaret:
...Huff...

Margaret:
Strong opponents and insurmountable difficulties do not frighten me.

Margaret:
On the contrary, the paralysis and degeneracy this city shows even right this moment are much more terrifying than you.

Greatmouth Mob:
Somebody, stop these two! Pull them apart!

Nightmare Knight:
Modern Kazimierz is indeed sickening—

Nightmare Knight:
—Come, let fear open the eyes of these spectators. Show them just what it is they are watching.

???:
That's enough.

Nightmare Knight:
—What?

A figure reminiscent of blood fissures the earth.

The ground between the two is cleaved apart by a giant axe appearing from thin air.

???:
I said: that's enough.

???:
The match is over...

Nightmare Knight:
......

Margaret:
It's you... The Blood Knight.

Greatmouth Mob:
Who could have known?! No one could possibly have anticipated that the one who would finally put a stop to this unstoppable battle would be—!

Greatmouth Mob:
'Kazimierz's Crimson Goblet', the hero, Dikaiopolis! It's not an easy name to remember, but be sure not to take your eyes off this—

Greatmouth Mob:
That's the champion of the Kazimierz Major, undoubtedly the most popular of them all, the god of war from Minos! THE—BLOOOOOOOOOD—KNIIIIIIIIIGHT!!

Greatmouth Mob:
(Man, thank goodness he showed up. Guess I put on a decent enough show today? Hey, one of you, go check on the spokesman and tell me how he's reacting!)

'A Silverlance Pegasus':
Dikaiopolis... A Minoan name. So he's the Infected who took the title three years ago.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
This is my first time seeing the Blood Knight fight in person too... What a potent aura.

Left-hand Knight:
Hmph...

The Blood Knight:
......

Greatmouth Mob:
Whoa! The Blood Knight leaped into the arena! And he's walking toward our brawling contestants!

Greatmouth Mob:
It's been years since Kazimierz has seen something like this!! Two champions! We have two champions on the same stage! What a sight to behold!

Greatmouth Mob:
Of course, of course! The man standing on the other side isn't exactly your average Józef either, having just demonstrated his immense strength. What's more, that's Kazimierz's last Nightzmora we're talking about—

Greatmouth Mob:
This here, everyone, is a million dollar marvel! Do not ever forget this moment! This is one for the history books!

Nightmare Knight:
You... another champion...

The Blood Knight:
Your next opponent is me, Nightzmora.

Nightmare Knight:
......

The Blood Knight:
And my next opponent is you.

Margaret:
......

Nightmare Knight:
Hah... hahaha... I sense you imply I will lose to you.

The Blood Knight:
Absolutely.

Nightmare Knight:
......

The Blood Knight:
How will a phantom who lives in the past possibly defeat me?

The Blood Knight:
You, Infected, I look forward to the day I fight against you.

Nightmare Knight:
Do you think you can just walk away?

The Blood Knight:
—

Nightmare Knight:
–––Hraagh!

The Blood Knight:
Nightzmora, you should understand that you can only instill fear in those who live in the 'present'.

Margaret:
(He managed to deflect that strike from such an angle...?)

The Blood Knight:
We will meet on the field.

The Radiant Knight:
......

Margaret turns around to look at the axe-marked ground.

The Blood Knight walks over to retrieve his weapon.

It seems as though blood is spilling out of the lifeless fissure in the earth.
