Roy:
The Infected are making their move.

Monique:
They'll really charge through the front door?

Roy:
They'd better. The bigger their ruckus, the less we leave the Board to use against us.

Roy:
How are things at the power plant?

Monique:
Are you doubting me?

Roy:
I wouldn't dare.

Monique:
Can I kill Wild Mane?

Roy:
Of course... now that things have come to this.

Roy:
If we find ourselves some prey, that'll help make our owners less grumpy.

Monique:
......

Monique:
They're prey who got away to begin with... I'm just taking back what should've been mine.

Monique:
Contact Team 3. Have them pack it up and come with me.

An Armorless Union Member:
Wild Mane spotted! Wild—

Iwona:
Too slow, Armorless!

An Armorless Union Member:
Urgh!

Iwona:
Pulling dirty tricks in the shadows... Don't tell me you people have forgotten how to take on a knight!

An Armorless Union Member:
Filthy Infected!

Iwona:
This is for Jamie and all the innocent who died by your hands!

An Armorless Union Member:
Eek—

An Infected Knight:
—Iwona! Don't forget what Sona said. Avoid killing anyone if you can... At the very least, when you kill them, make sure you're prepared to handle it.

Iwona:
Hey, you. Armorless... How many people have you killed?

An Armorless Union Member:
Heh...

An Armorless Union Member:
Trying to act all righteous now, are we? Hypocritical brat. Back when I was a bounty hunter on the Golden Prairie, I never gave a crap about that!

An Armorless Union Member:
Have you forgotten what life outside the cities is like? Those who stand at the top, the strongest survivors, are all cold-blooded bastards! That's the way it goes!

Iwona:
—Say whatever you want, but I've won.

Iwona:
When you've lost, when you're dead, nothing you say matters.

An Armorless Union Member:
You—

Iwona:
He probably sent out a distress signal just now...

Iwona:
Hopefully that'll lure the Armorless Union here. That'll make Greynuty's job easier.

Justyna:
......

Szewczyk:
Fartooth, have you spotted any Armorless over there?

Justyna:
No.

Justyna:
What about you?

Szewczyk:
Greynuty's already in position. Just waiting on our signal.

Szewczyk:
That said, the Armorless can't be this slow to react... Did Wild Mane really manage to lure them her way?

Justyna:
She probably...

Justyna:
......!

Justyna:
Armorless spotted. They're heading your way from an alleyway on 4th Street, Iwona!

Justyna:
Iwona...? Can you hear me? Iwona?

Justyna:
Hey?! Szewczyk? Iwona?!

Justyna:
The transmission... got cut? No way... In a city with this much transmission traffic...?

Iwona:
......

An Infected Knight:
This silence is creepy... Iwona. I have a bad feeling about this.

An Infected Knight:
Are those Armorless guys really such pushovers that we can take them down with an ambush?

Iwona:
I'm not sure.

Iwona:
Bigger problem, I'm not getting any of Justyna's transmissions, and she should be staring down at us from somewhere up high right—

Iwona:
(Shudder)—

Iwona:
—Move!

All of a sudden, Iwona is overwhelmed with an aura so suffocating that it threatens to make her puke.

She isn't sure this is really a biological response. It could be some kind of toxin or an Arts effect.

Then, a figure leaps down from the top of a tall tower.

The figure lands on the ground. The landing is silent as the veil lightly covering her.

Iwona:
You jumped from so high up, but you didn't even let out a peep, huh?

Iwona:
Must be nice to be a Feline.

Monique:
Team 3...

An Infected Knight:
What?! When did they—

Iwona:
(The difference between these guys and the ones we fought just now are night and day... She's wearing blue. Is she the Lazurite from the other day?)

Iwona:
You go on ahead...

An Infected Knight:
But!

Iwona:
Go!

An Infected Knight:
You'd better survive this!

An Infected Knight:
Aargh?!

Iwona:
—?!

Iwona:
No way. I didn't even see her pull that bowstring—

The Armorless Union operative in blue maintains her one-handed throwing posture.

A hint of dissatisfaction comes through her cold expression. After all, this hunt started on an unlucky note.

Iwona:
She... threw it?

An Infected Knight:
Aghh! My leg. My leg!

Iwona:
Grit your teeth and keep running! Don't stop!

Iwona:
Hey, stop looking around! I'm right here!

Iwona:
......!

Monique:
Are you Infected all idiots? Look how many bows we have aimed at you.

Monique:
Wild Mane Knight, you should be dead several days by now. Good on you, though. You still have the chance to play hero today.

Monique:
Now run. I don't want this hunt to end on a such a boring note. Let's kill some time together.

Iwona:
Hah, you seem to be mistaken.

Iwona:
Do I look like the kind of gal who hides in the shadows?

Monique:
You look like the kind who's getting herself killed.

Iwona:
*Spit*. We Infected are sick of toiling our miserable lives away like that!

Iwona:
You're just a bunch of despicable bastards hiding behind the K.G.C.C., doing all kinds of shady business. Every one of us living out in the open is stronger than you!

Remember their faces!

Remember... These knights... These Kazimierzians... These cold-blooded murderers...

Don't let them get away with it!

Monique:
......

Iwona:
Armorless scum...

Iwona:
Have you ever fought a gloompincer on the brink of death? Do you know how a dying, cornered animal fights?

Monique:
You're too full of yourself.

Iwona:
I may die, but that doesn't mean I'll lose. And you. You'll pay your dues right here.

Iwona:
Then... My friends will...

Monique:
Look at you. No fear of death on your face. You don't want to live, yet you still want to win. Ridiculous.

The blue Armorless Union operative takes out an arrow from behind.

Monique:
Come.

Iwona:
You're going to use that arrow as a blade? What, you looking down on me?

Monique:
Of course.

Iwona:
You little...

Iwona:
Urgh—!

Monique:
So that's the speed you Kuranta are so proud of?

Iwona:
Don't underestimate me—

Iwona:
Hraaagh––!!

Monique:
Don't be such a crybaby. I made sure not to kill you.

Monique:
Now let me see how much blood you have to spill.

Monique:
After I've painted the entire street with it, the Infected hiding in the dark will probably stop resisting?

An Armorless Union Member:
Um, Lazurite, she is Infected though...

Monique:
If you're worried about catching it, you should look for a new job.

Monique:
Once death calms her down, it'll be much easier to deal with the resisting Infected.

Greynuty:
It's been a while since I heard from Justyna...

An Infected Knight:
Maybe she ran into some kind of trouble?

Greynuty:
......

Greynuty:
Either way, there's five minutes till our ambush.

Greynuty:
Sona should be in position by now. We just have to trust each other.

Sona:
It's almost time...

Sona:
Everyone, be safe...

Monique:
You didn't even last a few minutes.

Iwona:
......

Monique:
Go on... There should be seven or eight Infected hideouts around here, though I wouldn't be surprised if they're empty by now. Search all of them, one by one.

Iwona:
Get... back... here...

Iwona:
I'm not... done yet!

Monique:
I'm leaving her to you. Not worth any more of my time.

An Armorless Union Member:
Right.

An Armorless Union Member:
All units, prepare to fire—

Iwona:
Didn't I just say... I'm not done?!

An Armorless Union Member:
—She still has the strength to fight?!

Monique:
I don't want to kill too many people here...

Monique:
The old and the young can go, but I'll take the heads of ten Infected knights back to keep my bosses happy.

An Infected Knight:
You... You murderer!

An Infected Knight:
What did you do to Iwona?!

Monique:
She should probably have passed out from the blood loss by now, though it sounds like she might still be putting up a fight.

An Infected Knight:
You monster—!

Monique:
You should know that even if you manage to get away now, it won't vindicate you.

Monique:
I'll say it again. Ten Infected knights for the lives of everyone else.

An Infected Knight:
How can we trust you?! You're just a bunch of murderers, a bunch of sick bastards!

Monique:
I'll count Iwona... Just the lives of nine more knights.

An Infected Knight:
You—

Monique:
Are you sure you can win?

An Infected Knight:
......!

An Infected Knight:
I...

Monique:
Never mind, then... It'll be faster if I do it myself.

???:
Now what's the rush?

???:
If you want to keep your bosses happy, surely you'd want quality over quantity?

Toland:
Wouldn't you agree?

Monique:
Toland Cash.

Toland:
Not to toot my own horn, but I'm sure I'm worth a hefty sum on the wanted posters?

Monique:
If you are willing to give me your own head, then I won't need any more.

An Infected Knight:
Don't taunt her, Toland! She's—

Toland:
'Lazurite' Monique of the Armorless Union, am I correct?

Monique:
I said it before... I don't like to be interrupted when I'm working.

Monique:
If you don't plan on giving yourself up, that makes three times you've interrupted me, Toland Cash.

The injured Infected knight isn't able to see everything clearly.

By the time his eardrums react, there's a sharp clashing sound.

Toland:
Phew~ You really are quick on the draw with that bowstring.

Monique:
You saw it...? No, your stance... That's the swordhand of a knight.

Monique:
Since when do bounty hunters have tricks like that?

Toland:
Oh, don't say that. If all we knew was shooting arrows, setting up traps, pulling dirty tricks, and waiting for our prey...

Toland:
Would we really be any different from the scum in the Armorless Union?

Monique:
You won't dodge many more of my shots.

Toland:
You sure?

Toland:
Whew, that was close.

Toland:
Might want to watch your step, though.

Monique:
Nngh—

Monique:
An explosive trap...? You're still a bounty hunter in the end...

Toland:
Needless to say.

Monique:
—?!

Monique:
—A charge... You've received knight training?

Monique:
That's it. You're helping the Nearls... so you must have something tied up with them.

Monique:
This really piques my interest, but work is work. We can't waste too much time on you.

A Corporate Employee:
Man, what a pain... There's just no catching a taxi during the Major, is there?

A Tourist:
Excuse me, which way is the Holiday Knight Souvenir Shop?

A Tourist:
Hey, look at the time. Let's find a restaurant and get a bite to eat first.

Greatmouth Mob:
Will you look at that?! Our Columbian newbie is about to overwhelm Wisteria Knight once again!

Greatmouth Mob:
Impressive speed! Now just one more—Hold on, hold on! What's going on?!

Greatmouth Mob:
Unbelievable! A devastating accident at the very last moment! Did our newbie trip?! Come on, this is the Major! Get up!

Młynar:
......

???:
Do you always leave work this late, Młynar?

Młynar:
To what do I owe the pleasure...?

Młynar:
If I had known in advance, Lady Russell, I would've received you more properly.

Russell:
Don't worry yourself. I won't be taking up much of your time.

Russell:
Tonight will be messy. There will be lots for us to take care of.

Młynar:
......

Russell:
Młynar, is the sword-bearing wanderer back?

Młynar:
......

Russell:
The wanderer traveled through corpse-laden battlefields and boundless wastelands, at last making it to the fortress lit ablaze by cannonfire. Is the wanderer not back yet?

Młynar:
......

Greynuty:
—I still haven't heard anything from them, but we can't wait any longer.

Greynuty:
In five minutes, we'll begin our ambush and cut off the core power source. The core district, where the General Chamber of Commerce is, will lose all power.

Greynuty:
Then, and only then, will Sona have a chance to break inside.

An Infected Knight:
A big show then, huh? I like it.

Greynuty:
Our Adeptus 'friends' should have withdrawn the security here, clearing a path for us.

Greynuty:
We need to be quick. Get ready—

Greynuty:
?!

An Infected Knight:
W-What's that?! Where was that explosion?

Greynuty:
T-The power supply sector? Why?

Szewczyk:
Ashlock! Why did you start the operation early?!

Greynuty:
No, we haven't started the charge yet—

Szewczyk:
—We've been had. Get out of there!

Roy:
Now sleep, Kawalerielki, my beloved Grand Knight Territory.

Roy:
Good night.
