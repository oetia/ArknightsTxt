Withered Knight:
Guah... Uhhh—

Corrupted Knight:
......

Withered Knight:
Aaah... ah...

An Armorless Union Member:
Report. The Withered Knight is displaying rejection symptoms after the injection.

An Armorless Union Member:
No... We didn't observe similar reactions in the other knights. The pharmacists think it could be an allergic reaction that occurs in Sarkaz.

An Armorless Union Member:
What? T-That's a waste...

An Armorless Union Member:
It's almost as concentrated as the restoration gels they sell in stores as it is... This stuff is for fixing armor, and they're human. If we keep injecting this into their bodies, we'll end up causing irreparable damage to their brains...

An Armorless Union Member:
......

An Armorless Union Member:
Okay, I understand... They're Sarkaz... not human...

An Armorless Union Member:
*Sigh*... You heard them. Increase the concentration by another 0.3%... We'll find out the Sarkaz limit.

Nightmare Knight:
......

Nightmare Knight:
What... are you?

Withered Knight:
Gkhaa... Gkhaa...

Corrupted Knight:
You... Nightzmora... must die...

The young Nightzmora lets out a long sigh. He looks up to find the familiar night sky has been dispelled by the bright lights of the city.

Is this, too, a symbol of a civilization's advancement? Is Kazimierz conquering the night skies with its bright neon lights?

He finds himself struck with a sense of melancholy.

Maria:
Hey!

Zofia:
Maria!

Zofia:
Thank goodness... You're okay!

Maria:
U-Uh, Zofia? P-Please. Don't cry...

Bald Marcin:
I'm glad you're alright, Maria.

Old Knight:
How were we supposed to face Old Nearl if something happened to you?

Old Craftsman:
Not that we can face him the way things are now.

Maria:
Ahaha... You're not that old. What are you talking about? *cough*.

Maria:
Uhh... Zofia? Could you let go... Please?

Zofia:
......

Zofia:
Alright.

Toland:
Sorry to interrupt this exemplary show of sisterly love... but it seems Margaret is missing?

Zofia:
Uh... When did you...?

Toland:
I've been here since the hugging.

Zofia:
Ugh... Who are you again?

Maria:
Oh, this guy helped me out just now—

Old Knight:
It's you! Y-You're...

Toland:
A case of mistaken identity, Old Knight.

Old Knight:
......

Toland:
So? Where's Margaret?

Toland:
After all that ruckus, is the insensitive Radiant Knight still going to carry on with the Major, foolhardy as she is?

Maria:
I... I don't know if we should tell her...

Toland:
Heh.

Maria:
The Armorless Union isn't going to give up so easily. They'll attack again sooner or later. You're all in danger!

Maria:
But... telling Margaret is exactly what they want us to do...

Toland:
This is the Grand Knight Territory. There is nowhere to run. They'll always find you.

Toland:
These are different times, not like before. The General Chamber of Commerce is growing even as we speak.

Zofia:
This is for your own safety, Maria. We have to tell Margaret.

Maria:
Is that really going to solve anything?

Maria:
Are they really going to give up just because she pulls out of the Major?

Maria:
......!

Maria:
(W-What am I thinking...?)

Toland:
It's not a bad thing to be so lost in thought. So long as you're not like a certain someone, anyway.

Toland:
Okay, if Margaret isn't here, I still have something else to attend to. Cheerio.

Zofia:
Hold on, what are you—

Old Knight:
Zofia.

Old Knight:
Let him go. Don't ask any more. It's okay.

Zofia:
Alright then...

Zofia:
I owe you for saving Maria though. If there's anything we can do to help... let us know.

Toland:
Hm... Right. Your attack glanced to the side, Maria. Your balance was off, and you were a little too slow too.

Toland:
Seems like this is an emotional problem, though, and I can't pretend I know how girls work.

Maria:
Is it an emotional problem?

Toland:
Knights don't fight on the battlefield.

Toland:
You won't be getting very far on borrowed ideals alone.

Roy:
Confessarius. Seriously? Just the name gives me chills.

Monique:
If you're going to question that, try Darksteel.

Roy:
I'll pass... He's a Sarkaz too, isn't he? Something like a legendary mercenary?

Roy:
A Sarkaz from Kazdel, the Radiant Knight, and this Rhodes Island... Interesting.

Monique:
Interesting, and also in the way.

Roy:
We have to deal with both the Board and the Knights Association, we have to take care of the Infected so discreetly, and we even have to be careful and cautious about it. When will all this be over?

Monique:
Soon...

Roy:
Right... soon.

Roy:
But Darksteel doesn't step up. Doesn't that mean we'll have to take care of all this dirty work ourselves?

Nightmare Knight:
......

Toland:
Wait.

Toland:
Let's show some mercy. Why not?

Withered Knight:
......

Nightmare Knight:
They lost. I have the right to do whatever I want with them.

Toland:
They are my kin, and I can't bear to see my kin end up like this in Kazimierz. Let me take care of them.

Nightmare Knight:
Your kin... heh.

Nightmare Knight:
These filthy creatures don't deserve to be my war prize.

Nightmare Knight:
I'll break one arm each for their punishment. Take them away, the eyesores.

Toland:
Ah, that's it? I thought we'd have to fight to come to an agreement.

Nightmare Knight:
......

Toland:
Eh, hey now. Keep your blade where it is. Forget I said anything.

A Voice on the Television:
Reigning victorious over the Candle Knight, the Radiant Knight is making huge waves in both in the media and on the intercity net.

A Voice on the Television:
Furthermore, citizens are trembling in fear with Infected terrorism on the rise across the Grand Knight Territory.

A Voice on the Television:
Area 0's officer-in-charge and a General Chamber of Commerce spokesman have announced they will hold a press conference in the upcoming days.

Młynar:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Anyway... That's about the size of it, Doctor, Miss Amiya.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I'm afraid... things aren't very calm in Area 0 these days, and the Infected are taking the fall for the uprisings that happened the other day.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
These are extraordinary circumstances... but we don't want to put a stop to the sheltering and medical treatment just because of this.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Please avoid wandering around town the next couple days. I'm very sorry.

Amiya:
Doctor... the news...

Gravel:
It's not 100% false, unfortunately.

Gravel:
The Infected have actually been making a lot of noise, especially after the Radiant Knight defeated the Candle Knight.

Gravel:
We had eleven cases of violence just yesterday.

Hibiscus:
Apparently some of the Board members were assaulted?

Hibiscus:
Whoa... There are even protests going on.

Hibiscus:
I just hope it won't affect the knights... That lady yesterday said she'd buy toys for her siblings with her winnings.

Amiya:
Then... does that mean Nearl is...

Protestors:
Deport the Infected! The Infected don't belong in the Grand Knight Territory!

Protestors:
The Infected quarantine zone is an Oripathy petri dish!

A Commuting Worker:
What's going on here? I just got out of my meeting. How did things get so out of hand?

A Hurrying Worker:
Hm? Look at that city block over there. Isn't that the Infected shelter and treatment center?

A Hurrying Worker:
The protest's let up a little already. It was way worse this afternoon. They had a huge banner, too.

Margaret:
Do you need something?

A Protesting Knight:
The Radiant Knight... Do you know why those Infected dare do this out in the open?

A Protesting Knight:
They're committing terrorist attacks all over the city, dragging innocent citizens into the fray. Do you know where they got the courage to do this?

A Protesting Knight:
It was you! It was you and the Blood Knight. It was you infected knights who gave them the right the resist!

Margaret:
......

A Protesting Knight:
I... I know you're no villain, champion. I even used to be a fan of yours.

A Protesting Knight:
But by staying in the Major, you are only giving the Infected false hope.

A Protesting Knight:
False hope that... they can change the status quo.

A Protesting Knight:
You'd do well to keep your nose clean, Radiant Knight... Don't end up regretting your actions.

Margaret:
......

Margaret:
......

Margaret:
............

Shining:
What's the matter, Nearl?

Shining:
You don't look like a knight who just won a match.

Margaret:
No...

Nightingale:
Nearl.

Nightingale:
If there's something on your mind, tell us.

Margaret:
Right... I'm just thinking about the Infected.

Shining:
About that... we have another lead. Amiya knows already. There's no doubt that someone is behind all this.

Shining:
But you don't need to worry about that right now.

Shining:
Trust me, and trust Rhodes Island.

Margaret:
Alright.

Nightingale:
Keep your light shining bright, and worry about nothing else, Nearl.

Nightingale:
At the same time... Please don't push yourself either. You're strong, but your exhaustion is building up.

Nightingale:
Try to take it easier once in a while.

Margaret:
......

Margaret:
Kazimierz... is my home.

Margaret:
I'm very happy to see Maria all grown up and aiming to become a knight, and that Zofia and Old Marcin are both doing well...

Margaret:
But, right this moment, I feel more relieved that you two are here by my side.

Nightingale:
Are we your family too, Nearl?

Margaret:
It's hard to say, Liz.

Margaret:
It'll be some time before winter comes, but it still gets pretty chilly at night here in Kazimierz. Liz, go back to Amiya.

Shining:
We've all been worried about you ever since you 'left' Rhodes Island.

Margaret:
I know, but that's exactly why I can't drag them into my own mess.

Shining:
But you're fine dragging us into it?

Margaret:
You're free to leave now, if you want.

Shining:
Well, well, look at you. Our Radiant Knight acting all snarky.

Margaret:
Music...? Is there a bar nearby?

Margaret:
It used to be a row of regular old offices here. If I remember correctly, there was a publisher.

Margaret:
The Grand Knight Territory wasn't this big...

Margaret:
But, for the past couple decades, every time there was a Major, the Grand Knight Territory would pick out three cities to dock with after a round of competitive bidding.

Shining:
The Kawalerielki Alliance.

Margaret:
The city's changing... and even though this is my home, it feels a little... foreign.

Nightingale:
You haven't been back for very long yet, Nearl.

Shining:
And you dove straight into the Kazimierz Major right away... you chose to throw yourself into your ideals.

Shining:
You haven't started living a new, proper life here just yet.

Margaret:
I will, sooner or later. But now's not the time.

Nightingale:
You must be tired... I can feel it.

Nightingale:
Should we take a walk? The night breeze might sweep away some of your exhaustion.

Margaret:
Sure. Take my hand.

Nightingale:
Of course.

Shining:
How tough was the Candle Knight?

Margaret:
I was surprised to find a knight like her in Kazimierz these days.

Margaret:
She's strong, but her hesitation proved to be her weakness. It's too bad we couldn't face each other when she's at her best.

Shining:
Did you enjoy it?

Margaret:
I used to despise knight sports. No... even now, I feel nothing but sorrow for the shape Kazimierz is in.

Margaret:
But... haven't we been through a lot together?

The three friends walk slowly down the street under the Kazimierz night sky.

Far away from the loud markets and hustle and bustle, only traces of the city's warmth can be felt in this alley.

The warmth comes from liquor and song, as well as the aroma of baked goods that yet lingers as pedestrians come and go.

Margaret:
This doesn't change what we need to do.

Margaret:
And that's even if, after everything has come to pass, my journey is destined to be ridiculed.

—Like wings taking flight in the night breeze.

—Like a traveler with a heart full of dreams.

—The knight sets out on her journey.

—In search of true love.

Nightingale:
What a beautiful voice...

Shining:
Maybe it's a wandering singer.

Nightingale:
Is there a place so romantic in Kazimierz too?

Shining:
It's proof that there are people who live here.

—A fate as fragile as a cornflower.

—To face a test fierce as windstorms.

Nightingale:
Hmm... Hmhmm...

Margaret:
Liz, would you care to dance?

Nightingale:
Huh? Me? What...?

Nearl:
It's fine. Take my hand.

Nightingale:
Alright...

Nightingale:
Oh... S-Slow down, Nearl...

Margaret:
Alright.

The blue bird takes flight in the gentle night sky.

It dances amongst the glowing neon towers and navigates through a gently flowing river of time.

Taking the Sarkaz's hand, the knight waltzes back and forth under the dim lamplights.

The sight is reminiscent of the noblest statues found in Laterano.

Shining:
You're beautiful, Liz.

Nightingale:
R-Really?

Margaret:
Perhaps you will actually be able to dance one day.

Nightingale:
When that day comes... will you be there by our side?

Margaret:
Of course.

The knight stops and kneels down before the lady of the lamp.

Margaret:
I promise, Liz.

Nightingale:
Mhm...

Shining:
We'll be waiting, Nearl.

Shining:
At the end of your journey, before your light burns out, we'll be there with you.

Shining:
When the time comes, if—

Shining:
—

Shining:
Nearl.

Margaret:
......

Roy:
Good evening, Radiant Knight... and the lovely Sarkaz ladies.

Roy:
I'm absolutely delighted to see you again so soon.
