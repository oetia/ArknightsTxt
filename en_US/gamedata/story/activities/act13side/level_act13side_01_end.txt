Spokesman McKee:
A moment please, Mr. Malkiewicz.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Ah, Mr. McKee. Do... do you need me for something?

Spokesman McKee:
It's good to see you again. Have you gotten the letter from the Chamber?

Spokesman McKee:
The only spokesmen on competition duty for the duration of the Major will be us two... an arduous task, but a gallery of eyes will be trained on us.

Spokesman McKee:
If you want to continue your ascent up the ladder after you drop the 'spokesman' title, this is your greatest chance.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Haha... even if you're joking, I'm not really into the attention. I'd rather go off and handle arena event planning and stuff...

Spokesman McKee:
Is that your particular expertise?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
It's not exactly expertise or inability or whatever, I'm just...

Spokesman McKee:
You're being modest again. You've adapted much faster than any of the more senior personnel.

Spokesman McKee:
—But I have something else I needed to tell you first. I need you to know in advance.

Spokesman McKee:
Let's find a lounge to talk in?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Yes, you're the boss...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
What is it that needs such secrecy??

Spokesman McKee:
I... shouldn't actually be telling you this, but Mr. Czarny left quite hastily.

Spokesman McKee:
On each Major occasion, Kawalerielki picks three of the cities with the most rapidly developing economies to merge into the Grand Knight Territory you see now.

Spokesman McKee:
Within the few months following each Major, non-Grand Knight Territory cities aside, the nomadic cities return within their own one-month span to their original routes, following the route engineers' plans.

Spokesman McKee:
Each merging of the four cities is glorious. Marvelous flows of people, seamless trade relations, as well as the chance... to deal with a few problems.

Spokesman McKee:
To be honest, if it weren't for how excessively enormous the Kawalerielki Alliance is in scale, how unable it is to effectively move and avoid Catastrophes, and how difficult it is to handle supply distribution and mining...

Spokesman McKee:
I'd hope to never see the disbanding of the Kawalerielki Alliance.

Spokesman McKee:
But what I'm going to tell you today is about... mm... an unspoken rule.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Regarding...?

Spokesman McKee:
...The Infected.

Spokesman McKee:
This year, Mieszko Industrial Group has provided the Grand Knight Territory seven nomadic platforms, to rival other countries' whole cities in scale... of course, this is how it appears on the surface.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I heard about this from my colleagues.

Spokesman McKee:
The main thing we should focus on right now is Area 0. It shows up nowhere on the legal listing Mieszko Industries has given.

Spokesman McKee:
It is a unique plate—a small-scale nomadic platform, currently linked at the southwest corner, outside Plate #17.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
That's where...

Spokesman McKee:
Yes. It's right next to the Infected shelter and treatment center.

Spokesman McKee:
Do pardon me, Mr. Malkiewicz, but every word we're about to exchange must be on video record.

Spokesman McKee:
This is by regulation. No spokesperson is permitted to act in any way which would betray the General Chamber.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
...I understand.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman McKee:
You look pained. I understand. When I first heard of it, I felt much the same as you.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
It's just, this is too cruel...

Spokesman McKee:
You are now an executor of the Board of Directors, a spokesman of the General Chamber of Commerce, Malkiewicz, my good man.

Spokesman McKee:
That's a reminder, nothing more. Of course it's not an admonishment or a threat—haha, Mr. Czarny always did carry that air, didn't he?

Spokesman McKee:
Get a grasp of it all. Know what he's told you. Do as he said.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......

Spokesman McKee:
I don't mean it that way, Malkiewicz. We have to help each other.

Spokesman McKee:
You need to chew thoroughly over what I've told you. I'm off to check on a few Knightclubs.

Spokesman McKee:
Be seeing you.

Zofia:
...Młynar?

Zofia:
Are you there? M—

Margaret:
Aunt Zofia?

Zofia:
Oh... Margaret. Why are you still at home?

Zofia:
Didn't Maria say you were going to the Knights Association? That girl...

Margaret:
It's rote procedure. It won't take much effort.

Zofia:
Heheh. You really have changed.

Zofia:
Is it thanks to that 'Rhodes Island' place? You never were any good with the paperwork side of things before.

Zofia:
Do you still remember when you'd just applied to become a knight? Independent knight Margaret Nearl, always getting her documents and processes mixed up...

Margaret:
Yes. I'm lucky I had you then, Auntie.

Zofia:
*Sigh*... I understand it with Maria at least, but aren't you the same age as me?

Zofia:
I spent so much energy getting you to call me by name. We're apart a few years and now that's undone?

Zofia:
We can't have gotten strange from each other, can we? Hm?

Margaret:
Heheh, don't worry, Zofia. It's just been a long while since I've talked with family like this, face to face.

Margaret:
Were you here looking for Uncle?

Zofia:
Yes. Is he still at work?

Margaret:
Still not home anyway.

Zofia:
You know, Młynar...

Margaret:
...I know.

Margaret:
I'll be civil with him, and I won't blame him either.

Margaret:
So don't worry.

Maria:
Oh... the match's about to start.

Old Knight:
Same as it ever was. Turnout's ridiculous.

Old Knight:
That Bladehelm Knightclub sap there, didn't he show up last year too?

Old Craftsman:
Here, forget him, even their Left-hand Knight fell to Maria. What's the Bladehelm Knightclub got?

Maria:
Ugh... it was just luck, all luck. It's always embarrassing when they blow things out of proportion.

Bald Marcin:
Oh. Seems like 'Brassrust' Olmer Ingra's in this match tonight too...

Old Knight:
Ha, well-acquainted, aren't you, Maria—

Old Craftsman:
—Learn to shut your mouth.

Maria:
It's alright, Master Kowal.

Maria:
I've already given up on becoming a competition knight. It just doesn't suit me.

Old Knight:
That's what I'm saying! You've got a wide world of options open to you—no need to choose this or that! That's a bit of old-timer advice there!

Old Knight:
Besides, you've made a mighty fine showing already! Cheers to you!

Old Craftsman:
Speaking of, we still haven't done final testing on Margaret's armor, have we?

Old Craftsman:
Her last suit had some decent work on it, but it still doesn't fit a Kuranta as big and brave as Margaret.

Maria:
Ah... I already started on adjustments myself. I'll need a bit more time.

Maria:
And there's her weapon...

Bald Marcin:
When Margaret was new to the knight competitions, she used a warhammer. After that, she switched to a knight's longsword. Halos shone at her blade's edge.

Bald Marcin:
Now—she's on a swordspear.

Old Craftsman:
Hah! It's a Minoan beauty forged of D32 Steel. The ultimate in Originium Arts conductivity!

Old Craftsman:
Really takes me back. She came knocking, asking if I could change her sword out for an easier one to handle—the very first time Old Nearl's granddaughter ever asked a word of me—

Old Knight:
Enough nostalgia, Kowal, the Radiant Knight's down in the arena next week. Are you people even helping her?!

Old Craftsman:
Repeat that? You think I'm anything like you? Nothing but drink and idle hands all day?

Bald Marcin:
(Brassrust Knight's lined up for... capture the flag? Why's Bloodboil Knightclub squandered an elite knight on such a high-risk low-reward format...)

Bald Marcin:
(His opponent is... Oh, they're all small-time Knightclubs...)

Bald Marcin:
(...Hold on, there's an Infected knight in this...)

???:
The main Major matches. Mm-hm.

???:
When you became an Infected, did you ever picture a day like this?

???:
Ever picture being in this arena, winning yourself more wealth than nine lives could make?

An Infected Knight:
I know... I know.

An Infected Knight:
It's been my honor to join Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub, Wild Mane.

???:
Hah, just call me by my name.

An Infected Knight:
Fine! Once I get that prize money, I'll take you for drinks, Iwona.

Iwona:
Deal! No one ever drinks with me except Ashlock. Here I was getting bored out of my skull—

Iwona:
—Do you still remember the rules of capture the flag?

An Infected Knight:
I do. Stay inside the score lines and avoid direct clashes—

Iwona:
Hey, that's all the boilerplate Sona teaches you—if you ask me, you smash those noble knights' armor to pieces, you're the champion.

Iwona:
Anyone makes for your points, you sort them out. Easy as easy comes, yeah?

An Infected Knight:
Ha, hahaha... if I can do it, yeah.

Iwona:
Have a little confidence. You don't sound off proper, they won't give you any respect.

Iwona:
If you want others looking up at you, it's simple as dumping them on the ground, right?

Iwona:
But signs say someone's out for you, hah. Didn't Ashlock beat him bad enough?

An Infected Knight:
Olmer Ingra... is he only here to knock Infected heads?

An Infected Knight:
He sure has a narrow mind.

Iwona:
Kid nobles, pteh.

Iwona:
Looks like the Ashlock thing hurt his self-esteem some. Puffed up bags of hot air don't even deserve to stand in the arena.

Iwona:
Ugh—man, I'm scrapping. Maybe I should find a chance to beat him up in private.

An Infected Knight:
......

Brassrust Knight:
......

A Voice on the PA:
Now—will the knights please enter the arena—

Iwona:
Gettem.

An Infected Knight:
Alright!

An Infected Knight:
The kids are still waiting for us to get back.

Brassrust Knight:
...Gahah. Pinus Sylvestris...

Brassrust Knight:
The Infected, a living scourge... dares to call itselves knights?

Brassrust Knight:
To Hell with you!
