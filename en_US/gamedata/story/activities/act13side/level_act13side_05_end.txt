Monique:
I was wondering why you would have that immobile Sarkaz along with you.

Monique:
Now I know.

Roy:
Um... Monique? I'm not sure I get it...

Monique:
Then shut your mouth and stop embarrassing yourself.

Margaret:
The Armorless Union, is it? What do you want?

Roy:
First things first, please allow me to apologize to the Radiant Knight.

Roy:
That is, for the Armorless Union's kidnapping of your sister, Maria—

Margaret:
—

Roy:
—Hey, hold your beasties. It wasn't my doing.

Margaret:
You... you wretched henchmen!

Roy:
Maria should already have made it home safe. Relax. We have no more tricks to pull on you, and suppose we were going to do anything else, we would've gone for... less perfect results.

Roy:
We at the Armorless Union are just doing our jobs, even if it's not exactly what we want to do. We've got eyes on us from above. You know what I mean?

Shining:
You're attacking the Infected.

Roy:
That's how the bosses arranged things. Don't lay the blame on us.

Margaret:
The cause doesn't clear you of your crimes.

Roy:
I guess you're right...

Roy:
But isn't that why we're paying you a visit today?

Margaret:
We have nothing to say to each other. If it is a fight you want, it is a fight you'll get.

Roy:
Hey, now, let's cool our tempers, shall we? I'll be frank. We want to shake off the General Chamber of Commerce.

Margaret:
What...?

Roy:
We're here today to make this clear. We're on different sides. I mean, we still belong to the Chamber...

Roy:
But would you be willing to sign a peace treaty with us?

The Radiant Knight:
......

Roy:
You, the Radiant Knight, the Nearl family and its subordinates, as well as this 'Rhodes Island.' I am hoping you will all refrain from getting in the way of our plans.

Roy:
In return, the Armorless Union won't interfere with your quest for glory or lay a finger on anyone that's got anything to do with you.

Nightingale:
What about the Infected...?

Roy:
Sorry, but we can't possibly do everything either.

Roy:
The Infected are a threat to us. Not to worry, though. We have a use for those Infected knights too.

Margaret:
To take the fall for you?

Roy:
......

Margaret:
That's not what I want, Armorless Union.

Roy:
—What is the Armorless Union?

Roy:
Long ago, the local farmers and affinities pulled together and hired a group of veteran assassins to stand up to an indulgent knight noble.

Roy:
But they all failed—Every last one of them.

Roy:
The knight hanged the traitors atop his castle, to make an example of them. The villagers in the territory could only keep their mouths shut and give up their fight.

Roy:
Some time after that, however, there was an archer who took matters into his own hands. Back then, everyone figured that bows and arrows were no match for a Kuranta knight's speed, so they weren't really holding their breaths.

Roy:
Yet when the cruel knight's family awoke the next morning, they found the knight impaled through the ground by a long spear, mid-charge, his head still looking up.

Roy:
When the crowd got closer, they realized it wasn't a spear at all. It was an arrow. An arrow forged by Darksteel.

Roy:
'Darksteel,' the very first member of the Armorless Union.

Roy:
I'm very well aware that we're hired killers, but nonetheless...

Roy:
Legends like these aren't always without merit.

Shining:
—Nearl! Above you!

The Radiant Knight lifts her head.

The streets are only barely lit, and the stars on the night sky are twinkling brilliantly.

Among them, a lone shooting star twinkles a few times before straying from the rest of the meteor shower's path.

It falls straight to the ground.

Margaret:
—An arrow?!

Shining:
Break it!

Margaret:
Roger—!

Nightingale:
Aaah—?!

Margaret:
Liz, watch out!

Shining:
(Nearl and I both struck it at the same time... and... it didn't break?)

Shining:
......

Margaret:
Are you two okay?

Nightingale:
I-I'm fine... W-What was that just now?

Margaret looks to her side in silence.

There is a pitch black arrow long as a spear burrowed into the concrete.

Roy:
Impressive... I've never seen anyone react to Darksteel's shots in time, much less dodge them.

Monique:
......

Roy:
Your swordsmanship is as impressive as the rumors say, Radiant Knight. That was an eye-popping maneuver from the Confessarius, too... Luckily, the arrow's not life deadly—

Roy:
—Is that the smell of souls, Sarkaz?

Roy:
I never expected to see such fine swordsmanship and Arts... from a doctor like you.

Shining:
Save it... So much for your peace treaty.

Roy:
I'm sure you know already, but that shot wasn't meant to take your lives. The Sarkaz sitting over there would be thoroughly dead otherwise.

Nightingale:
......

Roy:
So, now that we've broken the ice, please do give our proposal some thought.

Monique:
I hope you understand that one shot just now, but the Armorless Union isn't begging on bended knee—

Monique:
There are three 'Darksteels.'

Monique:
How many of their arrows can you dodge?

Margaret:
Stop right there!

The Armorless Union members' figures disappear into the gap between the neon signs and the moonlight.

All that remains is the reverberating jazz music.

Margaret:
......

Shining:
'Darksteel...' a metal with an obsidian-like luster. Very heavy.

Shining:
It came falling down from the dark night sky... just as the name implies.

Nightingale:
From the... night sky?

Margaret:
The night sky...

The Radiant Knight looks up again.

There are twinkling stars everywhere, seemingly ready to strike down and ambush them at any moment.

Margaret:
This arrow... They must have shot it from far away. It was the high slope of the trajectory that made it seem like it fell from the sky.

Shining:
That makes no sense.

Margaret:
The Armorless Union... and 'Darksteel.' If everything's just like the smooth-tongued guy said, they were the origins of the term 'Armorless Union.'

Margaret:
These assassins might have their eyes on our heads right this moment.

Shining:
You're right. We need to be more alert. This is Kazimierz, after all.

Shining:
It's the fortress of their crimes.

Spokesman McKee:
Malkiewicz...

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
What's the matter, Mr. McKee?

Spokesman McKee:
It seems like you've lightened up a lot the past couple days. Did something happen?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
No... I just figured out what it is I should be doing.

Spokesman McKee:
Oh yes?

Spokesman McKee:
I heard you have a close relationship with Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals, and that you even arranged for their leader to meet with a few other corporations the other day?

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
That's true... Is there a problem?

Spokesman McKee:
I'm sure you know, but public opinion on the Infected has been getting out of hand. We'll have to do something sooner or later.

Spokesman McKee:
Rhodes Island is one of the few foreign companies that operate in Area 0, but they have the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi's support nonetheless.

Spokesman McKee:
We must treat this Rhodes Island seriously. Actually, a few of the executives have already made clear that they want us to investigate... and make sure they're dealt with.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Dealt with... huh?

Spokesman McKee:
There are certain secrets about Area 0 that we can't let an outsider uncover.

Spokesman McKee:
We're deploying the Armorless Union here, and the responsible party will again be given the Platinum's command.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
The Armorless Union?!

Spokesman McKee:
However... I also proposed to the Board that they put you in charge of this.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
Mr. McKee! Thank you!

Spokesman McKee:
Don't mention it.

Spokesman McKee:
I'm hoping your relationship with Rhodes Island will keep things simple. When you do business in Kazimierz, you have to play by Kazimierz's rules.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
I understand.

Spokesman McKee:
Another thing... Please make sure word doesn't get out on this whole affair, lest things turn dangerous. Even though Platinum and most of the Armorless Union are still under control.

Spokesman McKee:
There remains a problem with the Armorless Union's internal affairs. A huge problem.

Spokesman Malkiewicz:
......!

Gravel:
...Doctor.

Gravel:
Spacing out again? Are you bored?

Gravel:
Lately, a lot of people here in the Grand Knight Territory are boycotting the Infected knights.

Gravel:
If it weren't for that... Hehe... I would've loved to take a stroll around town with you.

Gravel:
Well... but of course.

Gravel:
I find myself wondering... what is your company trying to do here in Kazimierz?

Gravel:
......

Gravel:
That's a pretty unsurprising answer.

Gravel:
Though, in the past, I would've thought it an excuse... I guess the Radiant Knight has pretty high standing at Rhodes Island?

Gravel:
Kazimierz companies these days like to boast about having flat management structures, but it's actually a ploy to get the bottom-rung workers to let their guard down.

Gravel:
But if that's what you say, Doctor... then let's go with that.

Gravel:
Does this mean that if I come work part time at Rhodes Island right now, we'll be... on equal footing?

Gravel:
My, I'm so jealous.

Gravel:
You turned a blind eye to the Radiant Knight's title and status, treating her only as a person... and you still respect her nonetheless?

Gravel:
What about everyone else at Rhodes Island? Do they have your respect too? If so... I think I'm a little curious about this place now.

Gravel:
There are a lot of knights who respect the Radiant Knight, though it's always for the same two reasons.

Gravel:
It's either because she is a 'Nearl' or that she's 'the Radiant Knight.'

Gravel:
As a knight of Kazimierz, it's interesting to be given a different answer.

Gravel:
...Doctor.

Gravel:
I was sold as a slave to Kazimierz. Ever since, my master taught me to be ready to give my life for others.

Gravel:
Even now, I'm ready to die for you, you know? Hehe.

Gravel:
That's how campaign knights are trained.

Gravel:
That's why the Radiant Knight's actions feel somewhat distant to me.

Gravel:
Do you think it's a noble thing to give your life for somebody else's ideals?

Gravel:
What if that person's ideal is to give their own life for somebody else? What would that get us in the end?

Gravel:
......

Gravel:
That's a naive way of thinking. It's nothing like how sharp you were when dealing with the K.G.C.C.

Gravel:
What is it?

Gravel:
How could you say that? You're doubting my loyal—

Gravel:
......

Roy:
......

Monique:
What's on your mind?

Roy:
Nothing, it's just... it's been a while since I last saw Darksteel make a move.

Monique:
When was it?

Roy:
You weren't a Lazurite yet... It was when we took care of the last Platinum.

Roy:
That Platinum was Centaurea's master... or something like that, I guess?

Roy:
It was raining that day. The time was 4:47 P.M., and I was just about to go on a business trip to another city.

Roy:
I was the only Lazurite at the time, and I got a call all of a sudden. They told me that 'Platinum' betrayed us, and I had to take him out immediately.

Monique:
So...? Did you kill your coworker with your own two hands?

Roy:
Nope. If I'd done that, I'm not sure I'd ever get a decent night's sleep again.

Roy:
Actually, by the time we made it there... Haha... It was an unfinished building.

Roy:
The whole third floor was wrecked, and the traitor... was nailed to the wall high above the ground with one of Darksteel's heavy arrows pierced straight through his chest.

Roy:
Now, I may be an amateur when it comes to on-site investigation, but I could tell that 'Platinum' tried to run away, only to get shot through the chest by the arrow mid-air, and pinned to the wall like that.

Roy:
I was standing right under the wall, and the poor guy who fell in love with his target and tried to betray us was nailed right there above me.

Roy:
I can still see it in my mind. I'd never seen a wall as white as that, and he looked like he really suffered.

Monique:
Only an idiot would be fooled by somebody spouting freedom and platitudes. They don't understand what it actually means to survive.

Roy:
It's me.

Roy:
Hm... Are they finally making their move?

Monique:
Pinus Sylvestris, huh...?

Roy:
Right, they're very cautious... but... they couldn't hold back any longer.

Roy:
I mean, we've had those Infected boycott protests the last two days. It's ironic. I'm not even sure who's the victim here anymore.

Roy:
*Sigh*, another phone call? Does it ever stop?

Roy:
Hello—

A Voice from the Phone:
Why didn't you position yourself at the specified coordinates?

A Voice from the Phone:
The Confessarius and the Radiant Knight wouldn't have blocked that arrow.

Roy:
......

A Voice from the Phone:
You had them face north, and they saw my arrow in time.

A Voice from the Phone:
I could've killed the Sarkaz sitting on the chair at least.

Roy:
Ahaha, I'm not sure what you're talking about—I can't just laugh this one off, eh?

Roy:
That was my quick thinking, Boss. The Radiant Knight's a stubborn one. If you kill one of her friends, you'll just end up provoking her.

A Voice from the Phone:
If she'd lose her cool, I don't see why we shouldn't have.

Roy:
That would've been too dangerous, Boss. Sorry for only cluing you in after the fact, but I think the threat level we're at is just right. Let's not overdo it.

Roy:
Trust me. The Radiant Knight won't get in your way... By the way, may I ask how things are going right now?

A Voice from the Phone:
The Board will figure this out soon... but no matter. When the city is paralyzed by the Infected...

A Voice from the Phone:
I will end the last of the insiders, personally.

A Voice from the Phone:
And then no one alive will know the identities of the Armorless Union's highest ranking members.

Justyna:
In position.

Szewczyk:
Loud and clear.

Greynuty:
All ready.

An Infected Knight:
Yeah! We can do this!

Greynuty:
Sona... The backup power's kicking in way too fast. They might have improved their emergency measures.

Greynuty:
Please... Please be careful.

Iwona:
Hah, so you're saying I should put on an even bigger show?

An Infected Knight:
That's right, Wild Mane! Bash those Armorless Union bastards' brains in!

Iwona:
Of course! I'm ready, anytime!

Sona:
Iwona will ambush the Armorless Union's patrol head on.

Sona:
After half an hour, Ashley will ambush the supply sector. If we don't run into any surprises, the Adeptus's guards will be 'sent away' at that point.

Sona:
I'll infiltrate the K.G.C.C. and take what we need. Easy peasy.

Sona:
Okay... Let's get this started.

Toland:
I can help you sneak into the building...

Toland:
But that's all I can do for you. You'll also need somebody to keep your escape route clear.

Sona:
That's more than enough. Thanks, Toland.

Toland:
Don't forget what I said. What you folks are doing means much more than you can ever imagine.

Toland:
Now, let everyone see this city cry its eyes out.
