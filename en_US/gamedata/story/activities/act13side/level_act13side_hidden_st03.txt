The Candle Knight:
As I am now, I don't think I have the patience to sit down to read a book––

The Candle Knight:
––Margaret.

Margaret:
Viviana. When did it happen?

The Candle Knight:
I don't know.

The Candle Knight:
If I had to say though, it would probably be the moment I charged into the Major without steeling my resolve.

Margaret:
You're welcome to stay.

The Candle Knight:
I've thought about it before. After all, the Grand Knight Territory still has a knight like you.

The Candle Knight:
But, this is also the choice I've made.

Margaret:
Choice?

The Candle Knight:
You know, when I decided to draw my sword so that you and the Blood Knight could go on that fantastic adventure, I was actually... very excited.

Margaret:
......

The Candle Knight:
Don't go all quiet on me, it's making me embarrassed...

The Candle Knight:
It's not the kind of experience you get to have every day. Fighting for others, for a greater ideal, for something that seems unobtainable.

The Candle Knight:
Maybe after leaving Leithanien, I never really lived as a knight.

Margaret:
You aren't staying after all? If you leave, it'll be playing right into their hands.

The Candle Knight:
Let me put this another way, Margaret. Don't 'let' me stay. Beg me to come back. I'll come back for sure.

The Candle Knight:
But for now, I'll follow the Nova Knightclub's 'arrangements'... and stay for a while in a remote city.

The Candle Knight:
It'll be a fresh and exciting adventure.

Margaret:
What about the other knights, your friends?

The Candle Knight:
The few that I do have, aren't they all here already?

Margaret:
I'm honored.

Margaret:
At least let me see you off.

The Candle Knight:
Sure. Having the champion see me off would be a great honor of my own.

The Candle Knight:
Oh, right. I forgot about this book when I was packing up. You can have it though, so that works out nicely.

Margaret:
A poetry anthology?

The Candle Knight:
'Twin Moons and Marigold'.

Margaret:
Hmm... I'm not familiar with Leithanien's literary scene...

The Candle Knight:
The wonderful thing about symbolism and metaphors is that you're not forced to come up with a single concrete answer.

The Candle Knight:
Just like the Radiant Knight and her deeds.

The Candle Knight:
My ride's on its way. Do you see it?

Margaret:
Yes.

The Candle Knight:
I wonder if the Grand Knight Territory will be different the next time I'm back?

Margaret:
You know as well as I that this country won't change so easily.

Margaret:
But at least, I want knights to be called knights once more.

The Candle Knight:
Good. Remember your promise, Margaret.

An Escorting Knight:
Sorry to keep you waiting, esteemed Candle Knight. Whenever you're ready.

An Escorting Knight:
Oh, what a surprise. Good day to you as well, esteemed Radiant Knight.

The Radiant Knight:
Hello.

The Candle Knight:
Are we leaving right now?

An Escorting Knight:
Ah, yes... You'll be the last passenger. The Catastrophe Messenger is also ready.

The Candle Knight:
Alright. I hope it's a lovely city.

The Candle Knight:
Until next time.

Margaret:
See you again, Viviana.

Margaret:
......

Margaret:
She's gone. You're still not coming out?

Spokesman McKee:
......

Margaret:
If I remember correctly, you're...

Spokesman McKee:
General Chamber of Commerce spokesman, McKee... But now that the Major is over, I won't have that title for much longer.

Margaret:
Maybe it's time for you to take a stand.

Spokesman McKee:
The affairs of Madam Droste and the Nova Knightclub have always been my responsibility.

Spokesman McKee:
I was just carrying carrying out my last assignment. But by the looks of things, I was too late. What a shame.

Margaret:
You... I see.

Spokesman McKee:
The way Madam Droste was mistreated... has everything to do with you.

Spokesman McKee:
Radiant Knight, we are now enemies, given what you did at the Major.

Margaret:
That's not quite accurate, Spokesman.

Margaret:
It's just that we're committed to our own beliefs, and fight for our own ideals and justice.

Margaret:
That is... assuming the General Chamber still has ideals, and isn't just relying on others to line their pockets.

Spokesman McKee:
I didn't expect you to be this sharp-witted.

Margaret:
I'm just stating facts.

Spokesman McKee:
Alright then.

Spokesman McKee:
So this is where the Candle Knight is going to live. Not a bad place.

Spokesman McKee:
But I'd write her a couple letters, if I were you. She might not be as strong as you think.

The Candle Knight:
The City of Saplings and Artisans, Ognisko.

An Escorting Knight:
Oh right... What business do you have over there?

The Candle Knight:
What business, huh...?

The Candle Knight:
Maybe I want to try my hand at poetry. The name of the city is pretty poetic, isn't it?

An Escorting Knight:
Haha, a bumpkin like me wouldn't dare prattle on in front of someone like you.

The Candle Knight:
You're too modest.

An Escorting Knight:
Are you looking forward to the next chapter of your life?

The Candle Knight:
Hmm.

The Candle Knight:
Maybe. It really might make for a nice poem.

Nightmare Knight:
......

Nightmare Knight:
What do you want, pegasus?

Ioleta:
I'm not sure if the knights still remember this, as it isn't something taught in the history books.

Ioleta:
The so-called 'Khaganquest.' The true name of the ceremony is––

Ioleta:
(Ancient language) The Khaganquest that crosses the heavens.

Nightmare Knight:
What... do you know...?

Ioleta:
When Nightzmora warriors came of age, they would head to a trial site of their choosing, under the watchful eyes of their family and tribe leader.

Ioleta:
The ancient race's traditions always believed 'self-reflection' to be the ultimate test. Confidence or arrogance, caution or cowardice; all would come to light.

Ioleta:
Not all Nightzmora tribes had this tradition though. Only a few examples of similar rituals can be found in historical texts.

Ioleta:
There is but one exception. One single person spent an entire lifetime completing that Khaganquest, and that person has entered history.

Nightmare Knight:
......

Ioleta:
Tola. We assumed your grandfather to be deceased, but not only did he survive, he also continued the Nightzmora bloodline.

Nightmare Knight:
Pegasus!

Nightmare Knight:
You...

Ioleta:
Anger... Your birthplace is hundreds upon thousands of leagues from the Grand Knight Territory. Did you come all this way to become a knight, rampaging your way through the arena, just to vent this anger?

Nightmare Knight:
––And yet, I still dare not raise my blade against you! Pathetic!

Nightmare Knight:
Who the hell are you?!

Ioleta:
Just an old, feeble campaign knight. Put your blade down, young Nightzmora.

Ioleta:
I wasn't done with my story. That man who did not complete his Khaganquest until he reached death's door, began his journey in the once-lush grasslands of eastern Ursus.

Nightmare Knight:
......

Ioleta:
He stood in the middle of the vast prairies, looking out across the wide land, and made a promise to his tribe and to his brothers and sisters–

Ioleta:
His Khaganquest would cross the kingdoms of the hippogryphs and the pegasi. He would topple the exalted throne of the Gaulish Emperor, and tear down Leithanien's thousand Spires...

Ioleta:
In the final ten years of his life, he did indeed complete his Khaganquest as promised. The great Khagan flayed the entire world, burned away the previous epoch, and set his sights on the border of human civilization.

Ioleta:
Your ancestors accomplished great things. Tola, you are a part of the Khagan genealogy... the last descendant, living right before our eyes.

Nightmare Knight:
Hah! The Kheshigs' greatest accomplishment was pulling the pedantic wisemen like the pegasi from their thrones!

Nightmare Knight:
But look at you!

Ioleta:
......

Nightmare Knight:
Even as they looked down on us from high, what have the pegasi done but watch as those pathetic jesters tore down the era of knights?

Nightmare Knight:
Take a good look at yourself! What about you resembles a knight?! What is that slender ceremonial toothpick at your waist going to block?

Ioleta:
In Kazimierz, I need not draw my blade on anyone.

Nightmare Knight:
––Nice joke!

Ioleta:
Also, we were not watching idly.

Ioleta:
We simply did not have the ability to turn back time.

Nightmare Knight:
Grr...

Nightmare Knight:
I'm not interested in fossils who've lost their will to fight... Out of my way.

Ioleta:
Then where is the place you plan to begin your trials?

Nightmare Knight:
That's not for you to know, pegasus.

Ioleta:
But you no longer have a leader to answer to, or a family to return to.

Ioleta:
You have no plans to come back.

Nightmare Knight:
......

Ioleta:
Vogelweide told me everything, Nightzmora.

Ioleta:
I've watched your matches. I can't stop you from leaving.

Nightmare Knight:
What?

Ioleta:
After you've completed your journey, if you still wish to return to Kazimierz, you can become a great knight and step onto the battlefield honorably.

Ioleta:
People of your kind are rare, and you are an exceptionally rare talent bearing the Khagan's blood.

Ioleta:
Though that bloodline no longer runs thick, I do believe you'll always be an excellent warrior. You deserve a chance to experience true, glorious combat.

Nightmare Knight:
So arrogant.

Nightmare Knight:
You and all the knights I've seen the entire way across Kazimierz have all been the same. Arrogant.

Nightmare Knight:
Fighting for you, fighting for this eyesore of a country, is supposed to be glorious?

Ioleta:
I simply do not wish to see such a promising sapling seek out its own death.

Nightmare Knight:
Hah. My choices are mine alone, pegasus!

Nightmare Knight:
Leave. Get out of my way. Leaving this city is only the beginning of my journey!

The Blood Knight:
......

A Kazimierz Villager:
Hmm? Huh? Whaaaat?

A Kazimierz Villager:
A knight? Why are you here? The elder never told us we'd get a Grand Knight to visit...

The Blood Knight:
I bought a plot of land nearby.

A Kazimierz Villager:
Ohhh! You must be the knight who bought old Jackie's plot! Ahh, a pleasure to meet you!

A Kazimierz Villager:
Umm, please forgive me if I guess wrong, but judging by your dusky red armor and your sturdy posture, your title... what was your title again?

The Blood Knight:
Hm... I'm not a knight anymore.

A Kazimierz Villager:
Then, if I could be so bold, you... might you be...

A Kazimierz Villager:
Dikaiopolis, the Blood Knight?

The Blood Knight:
I was once called that.

A Kazimierz Villager:
My god... You, you really are...

A Kazimierz Villager:
All of us are huge fans! Why did you retire all of a sudden? You and the Radiant Knight... Ah! If you're out here, you must be in some money trouble, right? I mean, just ask and–

A Kazimierz Villager:
No, no, what am I even saying? I'm so sorry... You're the great champion, of course you'd have more money than us... Come, come, I'll show you around...

The Blood Knight:
Yes. Alright.

A Kazimierz Villager:
Look, right here is the biggest shop in the village. The old master's not doing so great these days, and now his daughter's taken over...

A Grocery Store Owner:
Oh? And who might this knight be?

A Kazimierz Villager:
We were just talking about him too. Crazy coincidence isn't it? He's the one who bought that plot! Take a guess at who he is–

The Blood Knight:
No, right now, I'm–

A Kazimierz Villager:
It's the Blood Knight! The champion! The Blood Knight, Dikaiopolis!

An Onlooker:
The champion? Is it really him?

An Onlooker:
The Blood Knight is coming to stay with us?!

A Grocery Store Owner:
Th-The Blood Knight?? In the flesh??

The Blood Knight:
Yes.

A Grocery Store Owner:
I...

A Grocery Store Owner:
Oh, I'm so sorry! Ahem, I let myself get carried away there. Here, if there's anything you ever need... Just let me know, and I'll get it for you. Don't worry about the rest!

A Grocery Store Owner:
I mean it! No need to be shy!

The Blood Knight:
......

The Blood Knight:
In that case... what crops do you have here?

A Grocery Store Owner:
C-Crops, you say? Normally, we purchase all the seeds we need for the village in bulk, but if you have any special requests, I'll arrange it for you!

The Blood Knight:
Just out of curiosity, do olive trees grow here?

A Grocery Store Owner:
Olive trees? Th-The kind from Minos? Hold on, maybe the village elder will know...

The Blood Knight:
Don't worry. It's not urgent.

The Blood Knight:
Just let me know when you find out.

A Grocery Store Owner:
I-It's no problem at all! I'll be right back!

The Blood Knight:
......

A Kazimierz Villager:
Oh my, where are my manners... Am I being a bother? Hey! Give him some space! He must be tired after coming all the way here from the city!

A Kazimierz Villager:
Over here, sir! I'll walk you back!

The Blood Knight:
One moment.

The Blood Knight:
If you recognize me, then you also should know... that I am an Infected.

A Kazimierz Villager:
Hm? An Infected... Oh, yes, right, you're an Infected knight.

The Blood Knight:
You're not afraid of Oripathy?

A Kazimierz Villager:
Of course we are!

A Kazimierz Villager:
But what of it?

The Blood Knight:
Then you all should keep your distance from me.

A Kazimierz Villager:
Ohhh, that's what you meant... Right, you are an Infected after all. I'm sorry, I was way too excited.

A Kazimierz Villager:
But still, don't you need people to help you out every now and then?

The Blood Knight:
......

A Kazimierz Villager:
See, farming isn't something you can just jump right into... Um, you don't have any prior experience, right?

A Kazimierz Villager:
There are a few students in the village. When I head back, I'll ask them if they know if you can grow olives here... Oh, that's right, about the Oripathy. Um...

A Kazimierz Villager:
Can they treat Oripathy in the city?

The Blood Knight:
Not effectively. That's why I chose the plot of land farthest from the village. If you don't have any particular business with me, it's better to stay away. It's very dangerous.

A Kazimierz Villager:
Then, do you think I can get an autograph first?

The Blood Knight:
...Heh.

The Blood Knight:
What's your name?

A Kazimierz Villager:
Me? Oh, haha... I forgot to introduce myself. They all just call me the old dentist. You can call me that too if you'd like.

The Blood Knight:
Sure.

The Blood Knight:
If there's anything I need help with, I'll be sure to ask.

The Blood Knight:
But at least right now, I need to...

The Blood Knight:
......

A Kazimierz Villager:
Sir?

The Blood Knight:
...Haha.

The Blood Knight:
'Go home first.' Need a change of clothes too. Can't always be walking around in a full suit of armor. Why don't you head back home for now?

A Kazimierz Villager:
Right, right, I should do that!

A Kazimierz Villager:
Well, I won't keep you any longer, Sir! See you later!

The Blood Knight:
...*cough*

The Blood Knight:
*Hack!* *cough* *cough* ––

The Blood Knight:
Whew. I really do need to hurry back... and grab a change of clothes... *cough*...

A Kazimierz Villager:
Wow... I never expected to actually meet the Blood Knight in person... I can still hardly believe it!

A Kazimierz Villager:
Hm? But now that I think about it, when did he announce his retirement? And he even chose to come to a place this far out in the sticks... I wonder if there's some other reason he can't talk about? Hmm...

A Kazimierz Villager:
Hmm? Another visitor? Since when is our sleepy little village so lively? Maybe living in the big city really isn't all it's chalked up to be, haha!

A Kazimierz Villager:
Hello there! Where are you from? The road ends up ahead! Come this way!

Roy:
Good day to you, mister.

■■ years later, Northern Ursus, 'Border of Civilization'

1:43 P.M. \ Light snow

Ursus Officer A:
Why are we still out on patrol on such a cold day?

Ursus Officer B:
Stop your whining... There's not so much as a village around these parts, only a Sami observatory a bit further off... Well, it actually belongs to a Columbian.

Ursus Officer A:
That's strange!

Ursus Officer B:
I heard–– but this is only a rumor, that yesterday, a Sami priest of some sort was in a real hurry to see the boss.

Ursus Officer A:
A Sami priest? Oh, you must be talking about those snowpriests. Why are those terrible things crossing the border all of a sudden?

Ursus Officer B:
Hell if I know. Well above our pay grade though. Not something we need to know... Just keep your head down and your eyes fixed on the endless snow in front of you. Each and every day, 'til your eyes hurt.

Ursus Officer A:
Fair enough–– Wait, slow down!

Ursus Officer A:
Up ahead... Are you seeing that over there?

Ursus Officer B:
Is that... a horn?

Ursus Officer A:
Looks like it's been left here for a while too... I don't see any wheel markings or footsteps. What do we do?

Ursus Officer B:
Let's head back and report it to the boss. There shouldn't be any man-made objects around here... Can you tell what this horn might've been used for?

Ursus Officer B:
Doesn't look to be anything Sami at least. Seems pretty old, and worn out.

Ursus Officer B:
Hm?

Ursus Officer B:
Did you hear that, or am I just imagining things?

Ursus Officer A:
Huh? Probably just imagining things.

Ursus Officer A:
Anyway, let's get in touch with the team first. Still got a working connection?

Ursus Officer B:
7th Expedition Team, 7th Expedition Team. We've discovered a... horn of some sort. Yes, no other markings nearby...

Ursus Officer B:
Hold on, it's that sound again!

Ursus Officer B:
Expedition Team, Expedition Team! We've found something else nearby! We'll contact you again in ten minutes!

Ursus Officer B:
Hey, look over there! Since when was there a forest that way?

Ursus Officer B:
Quick, hand me the spyglass!

According to the 7th Expedition Team's intel, two Ursus patrols found an 'army' at the far northern border.

And when they followed the trail of the 'army', they reportedly heard the sounds of war drums and clashing weapons, but could not find traces of any people.

The only thing left behind was an abandoned horn, nothing else.

The Sami individual denied doing anything, and the Columbian observatory only further corroborated this denial. The snowy land was shining peacefully, as far as the eye could see.

There was only a single row of footprints gradually disappearing into the thick snow, extending past the far north, beyond the border of civilization.
