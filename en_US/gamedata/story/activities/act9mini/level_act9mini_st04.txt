Armorless Union Assassin:
No footprints, no tracks at all...

Armorless Union Assassin:
They didn't go this way.

Armorless Union Captain:
The hospital team lost the target, they're bound to pass through here if they're trying to escape.

Armorless Union Captain:
Stay alert. I want regular reports.

Armorless Union Assassin:
Roger.

Armorless Union Assassin:
......

Armorless Union Assassin:
Hm?

Armorless Union Assassin:
Guh... agh...

???:
......

Justyna:
Go.

Justyna:
They're going to know something's wrong. Come with me while there's still time.

Plastic Knight:
I don't take orders from Infected.

Plastic Knight:
Though I admit you have some skill, able to handle those lowlifes from that distance.

Plastic Knight:
But don't think that means I'm here to listen to you.

Justyna:
......

Justyna:
The Armorless have this whole place surrounded. You're not getting out of here alone.

Justyna:
They're not going to give up the chase.

Plastic Knight:
So what?

Plastic Knight:
I'll make them pay for it.

Justyna:
That's not going to be easy.

Justyna:
Your wounds haven't healed, how can you hide from them like this?

Plastic Knight:
Ugh... damned Armorless.

Plastic Knight:
I'll go along with you for now, but only because we share a common enemy. I'll make those murderers pay for what they did!

Justyna:
We'll talk about that later, we're still in danger here.

Plastic Knight:
Don't think I have anything else to say to you later.

Plastic Knight:
Listen girly, you've got a certain champion to thank for the fact that you're standing here, speaking to me in that armor.

Justyna:
......

Justyna:
You're not wrong.

Justyna:
There was a time when I had bottomless gratitude for the Blood Knight.

Plastic Knight:
Hm?

Justyna:
......

Plastic Knight:
Why so quiet?

Justyna:
Competition.

Justyna:
I watched you go up against Maria Nearl—'Plastic' Szewczyk.

Justyna:
I don't like you.

Justyna:
You're slightly less obnoxious out on the field.

Plastic Knight:
Your feelings don't matter, but watch the attitude. You should never have taken me out of the hospital.

Justyna:
It was Sona's idea. And anyway—

Plastic Knight:
And anyway nothing. Sona is your leader's name? Hmph, sounds like another little girl.

Justyna:
She's a friend.

Justyna:
I'll take you back to the base. Sona and my other friends are all waiting for us.

Plastic Knight:
Make no mistake, I may have agreed to work with you for now, but I'm not part of your group, infected knight.

Justyna:
No, I'm very clear, you're not at all like us.

Justyna:
But, 'Plastic' Szewczyk, you must know, you have no hope of resisting the Armorless Union alone.

Plastic Knight:
......

Plastic Knight:
Heh... Sure, you're right about that.

Plastic Knight:
It's funny, Kazimierz as it is today. An Infected can be a knight, and a gang of thugs like the Armorless can roam about freely.

Plastic Knight:
Funny...

Justyna:
Let's meet up with the others first.

Justyna:
We won't get anything done by ourselves.

Ten days earlier...

Justyna:
Just who the hell are you people?!

Justyna:
There's no end to them...

A Strange Passerby:
......

Justyna:
Hiding in the crowd, are you?!

Justyna:
Don't think I won't—

???:
Wait! Don't do it!

???:
Ah... looks like I'm a little late? How did this turn into such a warzone?

???:
Not good. Not good at all.

???:
Anyway, let's pick up the pace. Start evacuating people first.

???:
That's all we can do.

Justyna:
It's you...

Flametail Knight:
Hey there, 'Fartooth' Knight, I still haven't had a chance to congratulate you on your title. Nice job there.

Flametail Knight:
I saw a piece on you. Popularity's through the roof, huh?

Ashlock Knight:
Announcing a new knightclub, getting real controversial, pushing that popularity up, hm? Hmph, looks like you've kicked a hornet's nest to me.

A Strange Passerby:
Infected knights...

Ashlock Knight:
That's enough of that.

A Strange Passerby:
Ugh...

Flametail Knight:
Alright, anyway, the fight's fought, what's done is done. *Sigh*.

Justyna:
Flametail, and Ashlock... What are you doing here?

Justyna:
Do you know who these people are?

Flametail Knight:
Like the back of my hand. But this isn't a good place for a chat... these guys are looking to make a scene, and the media will be here before long. That wouldn't end well for you.

Flametail Knight:
And anyway, you're probably hurt, right?

Flametail Knight:
Just come with us, all nice and quiet-like, and we'll explain nice and slow what's going on. What do you say?

Justyna:
......

Ashlock Knight:
Do you have to say it like you're kidnapping her?

Flametail Knight:
Huh? Did I?

Ashlock Knight:
A little.

Justyna:
I'll go. I trust you.

Flametail Knight:
Sorry, what?

Justyna:
Just take me along, wherever you're going. I trust you.

Justyna:
I feel like...

Justyna:
We're the same. I can trust you.

Justyna:
Where are we...?

Flametail Knight:
Oh! That was fast. Your wounds all better?

Justyna:
Yes.

Justyna:
Are all these people here Infected?

Flametail Knight:
Sure are. Everyone who lives here is. Most got unlucky, got sick in an accident or something, lost their jobs and homes, ended up with nowhere to go.

Flametail Knight:
Granted, the room and board here is a little rough, but... it's better than nothing, right?

Justyna:
......

Ashlock Knight:
Sona, Iwona's in trouble, I'll go see what I can do.

Ashlock Knight:
The Armorless Union is probably still active. I'll tell the others to be careful too.

Flametail Knight:
Alright. Don't worry, I'm on it.

Justyna:
......

Ashlock Knight:
......

Ashlock Knight:
Right. You've got it.

Justyna:
She...

Flametail Knight:
Hm? Oh, you mean Ashley? She's a good girl. The way she talks is just a little too straight up sometimes.

Justyna:
She hasn't said a word to me since we first met.

Flametail Knight:
Ahaha! Ashley's a little shy with strangers too.

Flametail Knight:
......

Justyna:
......

Flametail Knight:
*Sigh*. Well, alright...

Flametail Knight:
Ashley just thinks you're too different from us, like you've walked a different path.

Flametail Knight:
I mean, you're a star of the Major, with a shiny new knight title, so hot right now!

Flametail Knight:
No matter which way you look at it, you've got a bright future!

Justyna:
No... I don't.

Justyna:
An Infected... an Infected knight... has no future.

Flametail Knight:
That doesn't sound like something a big competition winner would say.

Justyna:
I used to think that as long as I could be a knight, there was still hope. If I could win in the arena, maybe...

Flametail Knight:
Maybe you could even earn some respect, be seen as a true knight, and win back the life you used to have?

Justyna:
Yes... That's what I thought.

Justyna:
But that's not how it works. An Infected knight is still Infected. And that's all that matters.

Flametail Knight:
Yeah. That's pretty much what I've said to Ashley.

Flametail Knight:
And besides, so what if you're a knight? Just look what happened to you back there in that crowd. Those folks who jumped you didn't care if you're Infected or noble or whatever.

Justyna:
You were saying they're with the Armorless Union?

Justyna:
Knight-Assassins... the words feel gross in my mouth.

Flametail Knight:
Yeah, that's them.

Flametail Knight:
They sell themselves to the General Chamber of Commerce, bumping off knights who don't play ball... They call themselves experts in handling knights, and wear that with pride.

Flametail Knight:
And add on the rewards, in cheers and treasure, that the audience heaps upon the knights, proper or not, how much dignity is left in the title? That's before you even talk about us.

Justyna:
......

Justyna:
So me getting attacked this time, that was the K.G.C.C.'s orders?

Flametail Knight:
Probably. You've got the spotlight on you, and you're turning down all the knightclub invitations, and talking like you do out there... sooner or later, you get a knock like that at your door.

Flametail Knight:
And if you won't be their goldmine, then they find you a 'dishonorable' exit, so you won't get in the way of their business.

Justyna:
......

Flametail Knight:
So you know, not that crazy you'd get attacked.

Justyna:
Two three-week periods.

Flametail Knight:
Huh?

Justyna:
On my way to the Grand Knight Territory, I got infected.

Justyna:
And since I was Infected, they wouldn't let me register as a knight. So I wandered around for three weeks with nowhere to stay.

Flametail Knight:
Hmm...

Justyna:
It was during the third week that the Blood Knight won the Major.

Justyna:
Then, three weeks later, they opened the registration window for Infected knights.

Justyna:
I didn't have any money left on me, so I went to the black market ring, working up enough money to pay the registration fees.

Flametail Knight:
That... couldn't have been easy.

Justyna:
Underground knight sports for infected knights is pretty much the same as the black market.

Justyna:
From the underground competitions to the Major, I've seen too many ridiculous things to be surprised anymore.

Flametail Knight:
Haha! Fair enough. There's definitely stuff going on in the underground fights that tops whatever the Armorless Union can come up with.

Flametail Knight:
We've all been through stuff like that, more or less, and that's how we end up here.

Justyna:
There sure are a lot of Infected here.

Flametail Knight:
Right... how can I put it? You can make a lot in the knight competitions, at least enough to buy a place for these people who have nowhere else to go.

Flametail Knight:
So that means the money's still worth something, right?

Justyna:
Right.

Flametail Knight:
Heh. Nice.

Justyna:
?

Flametail Knight:
You're easier to get along with than we might've thought. When I first bumped into you, I was worried you were all icy cold.

Justyna:
......

Flametail Knight:
Oh? You got all quiet?

Justyna:
I don't know...

Justyna:
I just... I just don't know... I guess I don't know what to say at times like this.

Flametail Knight:
Ugh.

Flametail Knight:
Alright... I think I get it now. You and Ashley are both shy with strangers.

Flametail Knight:
And this habit of yours where you say half a thing up front, I think I'm getting used to it. Not that there's anything wrong with it, it's just tricky to follow sometimes.

Justyna:
Either way, thanks for helping me.

Flametail Knight:
Ah, it was nothing. Don't sweat it.

Flametail Knight:
So anyway, where are you gonna go? If you pop right back out, they're gonna go after you again.

Flametail Knight:
That scuffle back there is gonna get reported soon. What do you think we'll see on the news?

Justyna:
No idea. Whatever they want.

Justyna:
Honestly... I don't know where I'd go. I haven't had anywhere to go for a long time.

Flametail Knight:
Hmm...

Flametail Knight:
Well, you may think I'm just throwing it out there to hold it over you, but this is an honest offer, out of the kindness of my heart.

Flametail Knight:
There's me, and Ashley, and Iwona, you've seen her, with the big loud mouth?

Justyna:
Yes, I know her.

Flametail Knight:
The truth is... we had the same idea as you, in your little statement about setting up an independent knightclub.

Flametail Knight:
I came up with the name already. Pinus Sylvestris. The Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub, a club of our very own.

Justyna:
—!

Flametail Knight:
And since you've got nowhere to go, Justyna, wouldn't you consider maybe joining us?

Justyna:
You're... inviting me?

Justyna:
Are you sure?

Flametail Knight:
Sure as sure can be. Can I spell it out any clearer for you?

Justyna:
......

Justyna:
Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub...

Justyna:
Alright. I'm in.

Justyna:
—Us... together.

Justyna:
Now that we're here, we're safe. Someone will meet us out front.

Justyna:
How are your wounds?

Plastic Knight:
Fine. Just a scratch, barely worth mentioning. But you Infected knights, you base yourselves here in the city? Not out in a village somewhere?

Plastic Knight:
No one would allow the Infected to live within the city limits. Just what are you up to?

Justyna:
Nothing.

Justyna:
When you've got money, you can do anything.

Plastic Knight:
Hah... money. True enough. So long as you have money, you can do anything here.

Plastic Knight:
But if word gets out, you'll be arrested.

Justyna:
Anyone eager to open their mouth gets a word with my arrows first.

Justyna:
I won't allow anyone to harm the Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub.

Plastic Knight:
Then lead the way. I can't stand the thought of the Armorless Union scum on the loose out there. I'm working against the General Chamber of Commerce now, so I need to move fast.

Plastic Knight:
Show me to your Infected knight leader, who forced one of your strength to drag me out of the hospital against your will.

Justyna:
......

Justyna:
Not against my will.

Plastic Knight:
What?

Justyna:
It wasn't Sona who sent me to rescue you. It was my own choice. Not at all against my will.

Plastic Knight:
But how? I understand we have a mutual distaste for one another.

Plastic Knight:
Or is this some kind of big picture play?

Justyna:
No.

Justyna:
It's just... you have a family.

Plastic Knight:
What are you talking about?!

Plastic Knight:
Those insects! They dare move against my boy?!

Justyna:
Don't worry, Sona has eyes on him. The Armorless backed off. They didn't touch your son.

Plastic Knight:
......

Plastic Knight:
Then I must offer my thanks.

Justyna:
You owe them to Sona. It was all her idea.

Justyna:
As for me, my personal feelings towards you have nothing to do with whether or not I'll let you get hurt.

Justyna:
I just... your son...

Justyna:
Without you, he'd have nowhere to go.

Justyna:
Justyna the Knight has a home, with family and friends waiting for her.

Justyna:
But Justyna the Infected doesn't.

Justyna:
An Infected has nowhere to go.

Justyna:
No, it's not just the Infected. Here, in this place, there are a lot more people with nowhere to go.

Justyna:
It's too late for me. I can't go back.

Justyna:
If the wind really can carry my voice home...

Justyna:
......

Justyna:
Then I'll have to ask it not to. Don't carry anything but the sound of my flute.

Justyna:
Let Justyna stay a simple, ordinary girl... dreaming of knighthood.
