Staff Worker:
Mr. Malkiewicz!

Staff Worker:
Over here. Please, this way, Mr. Malkiewicz!

Malkiewicz:
Oh, so this is the right place.

Malkiewicz:
Sorry. I'm not too familiar with the roads here, so it took me a while. Sorry to keep you waiting.

Malkiewicz:
And thank you for agreeing to come pick me up.

Staff Worker:
No need to thank me. It's the least I could do.

Staff Worker:
Please, this way. The venue is in the district across the way.

Malkiewicz:
R-Right.

Malkiewicz:
......

Malkiewicz:
Excuse me, but...

Staff Worker:
Yes?

Malkiewicz:
No, never mind. It's nothing.

Malkiewicz:
Today's forum takes place right before the Major's main events... doesn't it?

Staff Worker:
Yes, that's right. The General Chamber of Commerce organized this meeting, and while it is a forum, the format is somewhat relaxed. All spokespersons and corporate representatives will be in attendance.

Malkiewicz:
Hm...

Staff Worker:
Just show the invitation letter and you'll be let in.

Malkiewicz:
Of course. Of course... I have it right here...

Malkiewicz:
......

Staff Worker:
Um, excuse me...

Malkiewicz:
Y-Yes... I'm here. Yes, please, go ahead!

Staff Worker:
Pardon me for asking, but do you need any assistance?

Malkiewicz:
Uhh... Excuse me?

Staff Worker:
Frightfully sorry. I noticed you've been adjusting your coat...

Staff Worker:
If you've run into any trouble, if there is anything I can assist you with at all, please don't hesitate to tell me.

Malkiewicz:
Oh, no... My coat is fine. I mean, no, it's not a huge deal. It's just...

Malkiewicz:
It's just... I'm not used to it yet... Sorry, this is a personal problem. Please don't worry about it.

Staff Worker:
Is that so...

Staff Worker:
You seem a little nervous?

Malkiewicz:
Yes, just a little. Sorry.

Malkiewicz:
It's my first time at one of these forums. I'm afraid I'm... still not quite used to this.

Staff Worker:
......

Staff Worker:
You needn't be so nervous, Spokesman Malkiewicz.

Staff Worker:
This forum is a meeting organized by the General Chamber of Commerce. The spokespersons who represent the Chamber are the most esteemed attendees...

Staff Worker:
Please, try to calm down.

Malkiewicz:
But... I'm no big shot... certainly not esteemed. I... It was just a coincidence...

Malkiewicz:
Something's gone wrong somewhere. I shouldn't be here...

Staff Worker:
You are too humble, sir...

Malkiewicz:
I—

Malkiewicz:
Sorry, I have a phone call.

Staff Worker:
Please, go ahead.

Malkiewicz:
Hello? This is Malkiewicz... Please go ahead.

Malkiewicz:
Y-Yes, not a problem...

Malkiewicz:
It fits very well. I don't need anything more. Thank you very much.

Malkiewicz:
Oh, no, I should be thanking you. For sending someone.

Malkiewicz:
N-No, not at all! He's very kind, and he didn't offend me in any way whatsoever. It only took us so long because I was slow to get ready. Please, don't make things hard for him...

Malkiewicz:
It's a joke...? Y-Yes... Of course...

Malkiewicz:
Yes, I will be there shortly.

Malkiewicz:
Okay, see you later...

Malkiewicz:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Staff Worker:
Not at all, sir.

Malkiewicz:
About what we just discussed—

Malkiewicz:
—Agghh!

Staff Worker:
Please watch your step, Mr. Malkiewicz!

Staff Worker:
We'll head upstairs via Corridor 4. Please follow me.

Malkiewicz:
Uh, y-yes. Sorry.

Malkiewicz:
......

Malkiewicz:
......

Staff Worker:
......

Staff Worker:
The venue is right ahead. Please make your way there and show the attendant at the door your invitation.

Malkiewicz:
Yes, yes... thanks.

Staff Worker:
In that case, please excuse—

Malkiewicz:
W-Wait!

Staff Worker:
Go ahead, Mr. Malkiewicz.

Malkiewicz:
Actually... I was going to say... I'm not one of those people you'd call esteemed...

Malkiewicz:
So you really needn't talk to me like this. What I'm trying to say is... just call me Malkiewicz.

Staff Worker:
......

Staff Worker:
I'm afraid that... wouldn't be appropriate.

Staff Worker:
You are the spokesman for the General Chamber of Commerce. As a staff member of the Chamber, I admire your work, and you have my utmost respect...

Malkiewicz:
If that's it, I really don't deserve your admiration.

Malkiewicz:
I haven't done anything of importance. Perhaps everyone will realize I'm not cut out for this job after this meeting today.

Malkiewicz:
And if I got a phone call right now, telling me I'm fired right this minute, I wouldn't be surprised at all.

Staff Worker:
You're overthinking it.

Staff Worker:
The General Chamber of Commerce must have appointed you spokesman after due consideration... Your abilities were recognized.

Malkiewicz:
My... what?

Malkiewicz:
......

Deep Male Voice:
I dialed the spokesman's number, and you answered.

Deep Male Voice:
Therefore, you are the spokesman.

Malkiewicz:
I... I don't quite think so.

Malkiewicz:
If I have to give a reason, all I can say is... perhaps it's just something Mr. Czarny came up with on a whim...

Malkiewicz:
And I was only picked because I happened to be there...

Staff Worker:
I am sorry, but I beg your pardon?

Malkiewicz:
......

Malkiewicz:
No, it's nothing... Don't worry about it...

Staff Worker:
......

Staff Worker:
Actually...

Malkiewicz:
Yes?

Staff Worker:
I... I've met you before, Mr. Malkiewicz. I was fortunate enough to work on a project with you.

Malkiewicz:
Oh...

Staff Worker:
It's only natural that you don't remember. It happened a long time ago, after all, and it was only a brief collaboration.

Malkiewicz:
Gerald, the team leader...?

Staff Worker:
You remember my name? I'm honored.

Malkiewicz:
I knew you right away, actually... but, like you said, it was a long time ago. I wasn't sure if it was something I should bring up.

Malkiewicz:
If I remember correctly, we were reaching out to newcomers for the knightclubs... and we were assigned to the same list of names.

Staff Worker:
Yes, that's correct.

Malkiewicz:
Do you remember the knights we were assigned to contact?

Staff Worker:
I... I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

Malkiewicz:
It was a few infected knights...

Staff Worker:
Right, right. Yes, the Infected.

Malkiewicz:
Please... don't call them that...

Malkiewicz:
They were just knights, unfortunate enough to get infected.

Staff Worker:
Yes... Truly unfortunate...

Staff Worker:
However, they were fortunate enough to have met you. Thanks to you, they were able to join a proper knightclub. I am sure that was more than those Infected... I mean, the knights could ask for.

Malkiewicz:
About that...

Malkiewicz:
I think you might be mistaken. We didn't actually finish that job.

Staff Worker:
What...? Hold on, if I recall correctly...

Staff Worker:
Was it... the time we tried to recruit the Flametail Knight, the Fartooth Knight, those ones?

Malkiewicz:
Do you remember now? That's right. They had just won a few matches... You reminded them to review the contract the knightclub provided them.

Malkiewicz:
The knights were still young. We couldn't bring ourselves to lie to them.

Staff Worker:
......

Staff Worker:
It's true that the knightclub's terms for the infected knights weren't very reasonable. I mean, they may seem fair at first glance.

Staff Worker:
However, we normally wouldn't go into the fine print for the infected knights.

Malkiewicz:
Right... normally, we wouldn't have done that.

Malkiewicz:
Though this did have to do with the knights' future...

Staff Worker:
No one can predict the future.

Staff Worker:
Just like... Just like you.

Staff Worker:
If I hadn't taken a look at your file beforehand, I wouldn't have recognized you.

Malkiewicz:
I looked in the mirror before I left home this morning. If the person in the mirror hadn't waved with me, I would not have recognized myself.

Malkiewicz:
...In any case. Thank you for remembering who I am.

Staff Worker:
......

Malkiewicz:
This is embarrassing to say, but I'm actually still wondering if this is all a dream.

Malkiewicz:
It's just too surreal...

Staff Worker:
If this were a dream, I imagine it must be a pleasant dream.

Malkiewicz:
Y-You think so?

Staff Worker:
Is it not?

Malkiewicz:
Well... I don't think it's necessarily one...

Malkiewicz:
To tell the truth, I think I might feel more terrified than anything else.

Staff Worker:
Terrified?

Staff Worker:
What are you terrified of?

Malkiewicz:
Many, many things. I hardly get any sleep, and regardless of whether all this is real or fake, nothing good will come of it... The only difference it makes is that things are bad in entirely different ways.

Staff Worker:
The way you think is... peculiar.

Malkiewicz:
R-Really...?

Staff Worker:
Yes. After all, you are experiencing quite the rags to riches story.

Staff Worker:
From a lowly office worker, you rose to the top and joined the big leagues... I think most of us have dreamt of something similar.

Malkiewicz:
It's something that everyone has fantasized... Indeed...

Staff Worker:
What's so bad about it? It's not often that dreams actually come true.

Staff Worker:
Luck was on your side, Mr. Malkiewicz.

Malkiewicz:
But I didn't really... I...

Malkiewicz:
......

Malkiewicz:
I understand.

Staff Worker:
Do you really understand? There are many who envy you for what you have gone through.

Staff Worker:
To tell the truth—At the very least, I envy you very much.

Malkiewicz:
......

Malkiewicz:
Maybe... this is why...

Staff Worker:
I beg your pardon?

Malkiewicz:
Uhh, I mean, perhaps this is what's most terrifying.

Malkiewicz:
It's all going too well, too natural, and it's all too structured... It all happened way too quickly.

Staff Worker:
......

Malkiewicz:
Just two days ago, I was worried I couldn't pay rent for the month. I wasn't able to convince Maria Nearl to join our knightclub, and I was most likely going to get a pay cut.

Malkiewicz:
That was when I ran into Mr. Czarny... He was very busy during the Major's preliminaries, and I helped run some errands.

Staff Worker:
And then...?

Malkiewicz:
And then I took a phone call.

Staff Worker:
A phone call?

Malkiewicz:
A phone call.

Bold Female Voice:
From now on, you no longer belong to the Słoma Food Company, nor the Mieszko Group——Please keep in mind at all times that you are representing the General Chamber of Commerce.

Corporate Employee:
Wait...! I don't want to be...!

Bold Female Voice:
You have no right to ask questions.

Corporate Employee:
I-I don't think...

Corporate Employee:
......

Corporate Employee:
No, I... I understand...

Bold Female Voice:
Very good. I wish you the best of luck.

Malkiewicz:
There was no way I could possibly understand...

Malkiewicz:
Even though, from head to heels, this getup is specially tailored to make me a big deal, that doesn't mean I've really become one...

Malkiewicz:
Actually, I don't think this outfit suits me at all.

Staff Worker:
Nonsense... It looks great on you.

Staff Worker:
......

Staff Worker:
This may come off as rude... but I ask you to forgive me in light of us having worked together in the past.

Malkiewicz:
What is it? Please...

Staff Worker:
A bit of advice, Mr. Malkiewicz.

Staff Worker:
As someone whom fortune has smiled upon, you should try to refrain from sharing your feelings to those who, like me, are less fortunate.

Malkiewicz:
......

Staff Worker:
I really wish to empathize with the way you feel, but alas...

Staff Worker:
I can't.

Staff Worker:
There are many who wish to be in your position, myself included, but we aren't so fortunate.

Staff Worker:
Do you understand?

Malkiewicz:
I...

Malkiewicz:
I do... but still...

Staff Worker:
Perhaps you do have your worries. You feel fear, anxiety, and hesitation... but no matter what you are feeling...

Staff Worker:
You are well groomed and dressed to kill, you have the invitation in your hand, and you are walking inside this building as the spokesman for the General Chamber of Commerce.

Staff Worker:
Regardless of what you think yourself, in the eyes of everyone else, you are very much a big deal.

Staff Worker:
The venue is straight ahead, Mr. Malkiewicz. Please excuse me.

Malkiewicz:
Wait...!

Staff Worker:
I wish you a pleasant day.

Corporate Employee:
I heard you were once an entrepreneur, Mr. Malkiewicz?

Malkiewicz:
Y-Yes... I founded a company with a friend before. A very small one...

Corporate Employee:
It must have been a success?

Malkiewicz:
No, not at all. You flatter me.

Corporate Employee:
You're too humble! If we ever get the chance, please do share with us your stories of entrepreneurship.

Corporate Employee:
Your thoughts on the treatment of the independent knights was thought-provoking too...

Malkiewicz:
Thank you.

Corporate Employee:
Right, would you like a drink? Let me get you—

Malkiewicz:
W-Watch out!

Corporate Employee:
M-My apologies... I am deeply sorry, Mr. Malkiewicz!

Malkiewicz:
No, it's okay. No big deal. Please don't mind it at all...

Corporate Employee:
My god, your clothes—

Malkiewicz:
Clothes...? Uhh...

Malkiewicz:
Oh, the wine...

Corporate Employee:
I-I'm terribly sorry!

Corporate Employee:
I-I'll fetch you some towels right away!

Malkiewicz:
No, no. It's okay. I'm fine.

Malkiewicz:
Uh, thanks...

Corporate Employee:
Please wait a moment. Don't move. I'll wipe it clean—

Malkiewicz:
Please, you don't have to...! I-I can do it myself!

Corporate Employee:
Please take your coat off. I'm afraid it will be difficult to get the stain out. I will arrange for someone to get it dry cleaned.

Malkiewicz:
Take my coat off...?

Corporate Employee:
Oh... and if you are not satisfied with that, I can pay you for the coat...

Malkiewicz:
......

Corporate Employee:
Mr. Malkiewicz? Are you alright, Mr. Malkiewicz?

Malkiewicz:
N-No, thank you... It's okay. This is good enough. Please don't pay me anything!

Corporate Employee:
Huh? But...

Malkiewicz:
It's no problem. I mean it... Thank you.

Malkiewicz:
This will do... I'm sorry, I was in a bit of a daze...

Corporate Employee:
It happens. I understand. You don't seem very well, though. Perhaps you are a little exhausted?

Corporate Employee:
Were you thinking about work just now?

Malkiewicz:
Uh... I suppose so...

Malkiewicz:
I was just thinking about some advice I got from a friend.

Malkiewicz:
I guess he was right. It turns out my own thoughts don't matter, a lot of the time...

Corporate Employee:
Uh, what do you mean...?

Malkiewicz:
Don't worry about it, please. I'm talking to myself, that's all.

Malkiewicz:
It's just... even if I don't think I'm a big deal...

Malkiewicz:
It looks like... I'm stuck wearing these suits for a while.
