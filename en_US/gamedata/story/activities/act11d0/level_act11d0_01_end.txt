Rebellious Townsfolk:
Wh-why are those outsiders sticking their noses in our business?!

Rebellious Townsfolk:
And you, Severin! Your son died in that fire! How can you still aid those incompetent swine?!

Severin:
...Put down the blade and tell me who pushed you to do this? Who gave you those weapons?

Severin:
Final warning.

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Gah—!

Severin:
That's assault with a deadly weapon. You think you can just go back to your homes? You'll get a knock on your door soon enough. The Gendarmerie will hold you accountable.

Folinic:
Just 'hold them accountable?'

Severin:
I don't have to explain our accountability processes to a couple of tourists.

Folinic:
Do you have anything at all to tell 'a couple of tourists' then? 'Schultz?'

Severin:
I do. You're strong. Stronger than I'd expect a doctor to be. Impressive.

Severin:
And... thank you for the assistance.

Folinic:
Usually, we go by 'Operator.'

Folinic:
Now can you tell us where Atro is?

Severin:
It's not safe here. Let's talk somewhere else.

Folinic:
......

Suzuran:
Good work, Miss Folinic.

Suzuran:
Sorry I'm not much help in battle...

Folinic:
It's fine. You did your best. If I'd known what was happening in Wolumonde, I wouldn't have brought you along.

Folinic:
Even if we're just helping resolve some disputes, you're too young to be dragged into—

Suzuran:
Miss Folinic!

Folinic:
—*Sigh* ...Fine, fine. Little Lisa's all grown up now. Did you get hurt?

Suzuran:
No, I'm fine.

Suzuran:
But you were spacing out back there. What's wrong?

Folinic:
The quarantine zone is right near here. Everything seems to have gone back to peace and quiet after we drove off the protestors.

Suzuran:
Mm... It doesn't seem that different from any other place.

Folinic:
You're right, it's not that different. They have shops, cafés, ads for music halls and art salons...

Folinic:
No one's getting rounded up by guards and sent out to the tundra to die. They get to live pretty ordinary lives... You might even say they live well.

Folinic:
The Infected get treated so differently all around the world.

Suzuran:
If every place was so good to the Infected...

Folinic:
We'd be out of a job.

Suzuran:
Wha?! I mean, that's true, but I'd be really happy about it! E-even though I just became an operator...

Folinic:
I'm kidding... The fact that Infected can roam the streets freely only serves to underscore how special the situation in Wolumonde is.

Folinic:
...They're hiding something from us.

Suzuran:
Huh? Where did that come from—

Folinic:
Shh! Lower your voice! We'll talk once the officer is gone!

Folinic:
The Infected rebels are acting really weird. And they keep talking about a 'fire' and a 'doctor,' right?

Folinic:
Add in that officer who definitely knows who we are, and who really doesn't want to tell me anything about Atro...

Folinic:
And I can't shake the feeling that something rotten is brewing in this town.

Folinic:
Even Leithanien wouldn't go so far as to let the Infected riot in the streets. Where are the guards? Why isn't anyone stopping them?

Suzuran:
Now that you mention it...

Folinic:
I've got a bad feeling about this.

Suzuran:
M-maybe everyone's just a little on edge? Considering what the town's been through...

Folinic:
...I pray that's all it is.

Tatjana:
I'm so sorry to have dragged you into all this just as you've arrived. It's shameful...

Folinic:
Oh, don't worry about it.

Folinic:
Are you part of the local Gendarmerie?

Tatjana:
Not really. But everyone in Wolumonde undergoes military training. When the time comes, we have a duty to take up arms...

Tatjana:
But Uncle... Err, Schultz Severin is our town's highest official.

Folinic:
The middle-aged smoker who really doesn't want to do his job? Too bad, but that irresponsible disregard for duty doesn't exactly come off as mysterious.

Tatjana:
There's a reason he is the way he is—

Tatjana:
No... never mind...

Tatjana:
Oh right, how should I call you two?

Folinic:
Call me Operator Folinic, and this is Operator Suzuran.

Tatjana:
Folinic, Suzuran... these are code names?

Folinic:
Where we come from, most people prefer not to use their real names at work. Just like 'Atro.'

Tatjana:
Dr. Atro...

Folinic:
Seems you're acquainted.

Tatjana:
Yes... Sorry. I know you have your doubts, but the Schultz will give you the answers you need. It's not my place to say.

Tatjana:
Now, come with me please.

Folinic:
Of course.

Councilor:
How much did you tell them?

Severin:
Not much. Not enough to upset anyone.

Councilor:
I... I've put forward some unreasonable ideas, but you're always free to reject them.

Severin:
That's a creative way to dodge responsibility. But you'll get no comfort from me.

Severin:
If I stood here and told them the whole, unadulterated truth right now, would you be happy? Would that make everyone happy?

Councilor:
I represent the people, but you're the leader of Wolumonde. What does it matter if we're happy or not?

Severin:
I don't want to make things difficult. Especially when I'm hosting guests at the same time the Infected are stirring.

Councilor:
*Sigh*... Put it away. You want to make a good impression on Rhodes Island. Now's not the time to be lighting cigarettes or playing with crossbow bolts.

Severin:
I think we're well past any good impressions...

Councilor:
You——Wait, are they the two young girls out there?

Severin:
Young girls? Hah, wait until you see them fight. Then you'll start wondering if Leithanian schools focus too much on the arts, just like those bureaucrats.

Tatjana:
Sirs, they're here.

Councilor:
Ah, it's the doctors from Rhodes Island! Welcome to Wolumonde! I am so sorry you had to get roped into our local affairs like that. Let us make it up to you with an evening—

Folinic:
Thank you for the offer, but we're only here to establish Dr. Atro's whereabouts. We don't intend to stay long.

Folinic:
So, where is she?

Councilor:
Erm, well—

Folinic:
The local Infected seem to know 'Dr. Atro.' You're stalling, and I'd prefer you not.

Councilor:
Doctors, I'm very sorry, but things in Wolumonde are very complicated right now. We need some time to give your company a proper explanation, in order to guarantee—

Severin:
She disappeared.

Suzuran:
Wha?!

Folinic:
...Sir, when it comes to matters such as this, you might want to shed that flippant attitude of yours.

Severin:
The truth is flippant. It's simple. No need to sugar coat it. You're angry now, but you're not surprised. You already guessed it, didn't you?

Severin:
We received the Infected doctor who called herself 'Atro.' And we greatly appreciate her help caring for the many Infected residents of Wolumonde during this difficult time.

Folinic:
And you show your appreciation by telling us 'she disappeared?'

Severin:
No need for hostility here... *Cough*, *hack hack*—

Suzuran:
Sir, you look unwell. You should quit smoking.

Suzuran:
It would probably be a good idea to get a physical examination, as it could be—

Severin:
...No thanks, but I appreciate the concern.

Severin:
Back to business, after Wolumonde steered over here to avoid Catastrophe, Dr. Atro set up camp on the edge of town. She was housing some Infected residents.

Severin:
But not long ago, there was a fire in her camp.

Tatjana:
......

Councilor:
Er...

Folinic:
...A fire?

Severin:
I know what you're thinking. But according to what we currently know, it seemed to be an accident.

Severin:
Dr. Atro left town after that. And we don't know where she went.

Folinic:
How can you act like this is all no big deal?!

Suzuran:
Miss Folinic! C-calm down!

Suzuran:
We... We'll investigate ourselves. But you tell us she just disappeared after a fire like that's not going to upset us!

Severin:
...I'm very sorry.

Severin:
If I'm not going to talk lightly, all I can give you is 'I'm very sorry.'

Severin:
Dr. Atro is a good egg. She's got no Leithanian blood. No connection to us at all, really. And yet she's nobler than anybody around here.

Severin:
And when the Catastrophe struck Wolumonde, she didn't run away. She offered us help.

Severin:
I have the utmost respect for the good doctor. I hope nothing happened to her.

Severin:
But after the fire, you saw it yourself, some of the Infected folks don't have the same ideas.

Severin:
Not that I blame them. The town's cut off from the outside world. We're short on supplies. And a gang of armed Infected are out there circling.

Folinic:
Armed Infected?

Severin:
Outlanders. All of them Infected, all of them armed. Most are Leithanian, but there are a few devils among them.

Folinic:
The term is 'Sarkaz,' please. I hope the meaning of the word is not lost on you. Do you have any other information about the armed Infected?

Severin:
They're merely vultures waiting to pick our bones. And they're not the first.

Folinic:
Oh? So why didn't they immediately show up to plunder the town? Why are they just 'loitering' out there?

Severin:
Just come out with it already.

Folinic:
Wolumonde's lack of sensitivity toward the Infected is understandable.

Folinic:
After all, it's a miracle Leithanien was letting infected people live alongside non-infected people for so long—

Folinic:
—But it's also an opportunity for bad actors to take advantage of such leniency.

Severin:
What do you mean?

Folinic:
I told you, Rhodes Island isn't just a bunch of doctors. We're also experts at dealing with the Infected.

Folinic:
There are some areas... where I'd rather trust our own judgment.

Folinic:
For example... have you ever heard of the 'Reunion Movement?'

Severin:
Before the Great Rift, I saw that name in the newspapers from time to time. Mostly reports from Ursus, but occasionally in Leithanien.

Severin:
But to a small tourist town, it doesn't mean much. Folks around here would rather listen to the gossip from the next town over than official reports on faraway countries.

Severin:
What are you getting at? You think Reunion has something to do with this?

Folinic:
No, I don't want to jump to conclusions. Let's leave it there for now.

Severin:
Right... *Cough*. Either way, thanks for the info.

Folinic:
Speaking from experience, I don't think your side of the story will have much influence on our mission.

Severin:
That's too bad. But honestly, I didn't expect much.

Folinic:
We may have to do some investigating around town. We need to find out what the deal with this 'disappearance' is...

Folinic:
Rhodes Island will demand the necessary compensation from the relevant people.

Councilor:
Er...

Severin:
...Understood.

Severin:
I've no reason to argue with that face of yours.

Severin:
You can move about the town freely, as Dr. Atro's associates. You are honored guests of Wolumonde.

Councilor:
Ah! But of course! Please, make yourselves at home here. Upstairs is the Wolumonde government's finest parlor.

Councilor:
You must be tired from your long journey? Please, take a rest upstairs while we—

Folinic:
No need. I have something to attend to.

Folinic:
Can we start our investigation now?

Severin:
We'll prepare the paperwork and notify the residents after the meeting. As you wish.

Folinic:
Thank you.

Folinic:
Suzuran, let's go.

Suzuran:
Oh? Er, okay! See you soon, Wolumonders!

Severin:
...*Sigh*.

Councilor:
How long can you keep them in the dark?

Severin:
Did you see her expression?

Councilor:
I did.

Severin:
You did. Rhodes Island may not be the type of company to try to extort us, but who knows what they might do to avenge a lost colleague?

Severin:
The way I see it, it all ends the same.

Councilor:
But... but, it wasn't our fault. Shouldn't they be after the damned Infected that caused the fire?!

Severin:
We have no proof.

Councilor:
But we can't just take the blame either!

Councilor:
We tolerated the Infected as much as we could, and how did they repay us? Ever since the Gendarmerie left, they've completely been running rampant!

Severin:
...Indeed. As for the truth, truth is a fickle thing. See this match? Matches are more reliable than the truth.

Councilor:
The doctor's right. You really should quit. You've got a long life ahead of you.

Severin:
They're 'operators.' I only listen to 'doctors.'

Councilor:
Touché...

Severin:
Tatjana, keep an eye on our guests. Make sure they don't get into trouble.

Tatjana:
Ah, yes, sir! Of course!

Councilor:
Her?

Severin:
That one, what was the name... Folinic. Yes.

Severin:
Do you know what Folinic's expression of pain and anger reminded me of?

Councilor:
Don't keep me waiting.

Severin:
Tatjana. It made me think of her. Why didn't she show me a face like that?

Severin:
Thor was very nearly her husband. You'd think she'd be a little sad.
