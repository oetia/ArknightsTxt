Wolumonde, Leithanien. Once a bustling hub of commerce, this nomadic town is now rarely seen by outsiders.

Rathaus

Councilor:
Schultz Severin Hawthorn, where have you been?

Councilor:
How are we supposed to get anything done in a strategic planning session without you?

Severin:
Was I here when you decided my son's fate?

Councilor:
Well... Tatjana should already have...

Severin:
Yes, she told me. You had her tell me. I'm only reminding you what you've done.

Severin:
What's the situation?

Councilor:
The Infected are still protesting. They've even started chasing off Infected newcomers.

Severin:
What do they want?

Councilor:
They... they believe the fire was part of some kind of plot. They demand an explanation for Dr. Atro and the dead Infected.

Severin:
A plot? An explanation? Great, someone must be riling them up.

Severin:
Even the Infected wouldn't stoop that low. Most of them are from Wolumonde.

Severin:
Have they had any contact with that militant group out there?

Councilor:
None, for now.

Councilor:
But the militants have been lingering around the outskirts of the hamlet. I'm worried they might influence the protestors.

Councilor:
Just a second, it's from the sentry—

Severin:
Go ahead.

Councilor:
Two? Infected?

Councilor:
They claim to be from Rhodes Island? I know that name—

Severin:
That would be Dr. Atro's company. *Sigh.* We knew this was coming.

Councilor:
Wh-what do we do?

Severin:
Dr. Atro was a respectable Infected. They may be here looking for her. And they have a right to know the truth.

Severin:
Let them in.

Councilor:
...You heard him. Do as he says.

Councilor:
Hmm, are you sure about this? What if they have something to do with the militants out there?

Severin:
Between the Great Rift, the fire, and the Infected, do we have the luxury to be suspicious of everyone who knocks on our door?

Councilor:
What about after they learn the truth? What if Rhodes Island seeks reparations from us? How much is Wolumonde to suffer?!

Severin:
...So what should we do?

Severin:
Lock our doors and send them away? Lie to them? Tell them Dr. Atro took some Oripathy patients out on a hike?

Councilor:
I know we can't sweep it under the rug. But you don't have the final say in this. We have to prepare for the worst.

Severin:
No one has the final say on the truth, but... Never mind. Do as you will.

Severin:
I'm leaving.

Councilor:
Leaving? Where are you going this time?

Severin:
...I have a problem to solve.

Severin:
My only job is to get this town back on track. The decision-making process? I have little patience for your political games.

Councilor:
Hey! Wait!

Councilor:
I know you're suffering, and there's so much we could've done better, but we had no choice!

Severin:
I understand. That's why I'm still talking to you nice and peacefully.

Severin:
I'll leave Rhodes Island to you. You're good at these things. I'll walk the blocks.

Severin:
That's the deal.

Councilor:
Severin! Severin Hawthorn! You are this town's Schultz! You can't be running all over the—

Councilor:
Ugh! Must he always...

Councilor:
Sigh...

Councilor:
Forget it. Tatjana, Severin, Thor. They're all tragic figures, really.

Councilor:
Let's get this place cleaned up. Rhodes Island will be here soon.

Suzuran:
Wolumonde. Its name means 'The Eighth Moon,' and together with seven other nearby towns, it makes up Leithanien's flourishing northern trade network—

Suzuran:
That's what the book said, anyway.

Folinic:
From what I'm seeing, 'flourishing trade' isn't exactly how I'd describe it.

Suzuran:
Could it be because of the 'Great Rift' thing?

Folinic:
Yes. A Catastrophe of that scale is rare. It could be more than a thousand meters deep, with exposed active Originium on the cliffsides. I shudder just thinking about it.

Suzuran:
But, Miss Folinic... You were very curious what would happen if you lobbed a shell into it...

Folinic:
Nay, that was just my academic curiosity speaking. Realistically, one wrong move and the entire plateau could get cleaved in half.

Folinic:
Considering the detour we had to take, looks like this town won't be moving an inch.

Townsfolk:
Visitors at a time like this? And such strange clothes. I hope this isn't an ill omen...

Townsfolk:
Look at her tails. Oh, and the crystals on her shoulder! Is she Infected?

Townsfolk:
But those clothes look familiar... Where have I seen them before...?

Suzuran:
M-Miss Folinic, can we really just walk down the street like this?

Folinic:
The prevalence of Originium Arts in Leithanien have brought two major benefits: first, the incredible music scene, and second, a broad tolerance of the Infected.

Folinic:
There may be restrictions on your personal freedom, but should you want to live, you can win back that right as long as you're willing to pay the price.

Suzuran:
...Price?

Folinic:
At least it's something affordable.

Folinic:
Wolumonde may be in the boonies and have its fair share of problems, but at least the Infected have a place to live... That's what she told me anyway—

Folinic:
—Oh, someone's coming.

Severin:
...Hm?

Suzuran:
(Hm? That man's uniform...)

Folinic:
(Is he with the Wolumonde Gendarmerie? Should we ask for directions?)

Suzuran:
(He's coming toward us. Is this the welcoming committee?)

Folinic:
(I'm not sure...)

Suzuran:
(Oh, he lit a cigarette.)

Suzuran:
(He put his lighter into his pocket. Now he's holding the cigarette with his other hand. He switched hands again—)

Suzuran:
(—He walked away without looking back! Miss Folinic!)

Folinic:
Excuse me—!

Severin:
Hm.

Folinic:
Hello, we're—

Severin:
Ah, Rhodes Island, I take it?

Severin:
The Rathaus is just up ahead, right in front of the tallest tower. You see it? Good. Someone will meet you there.

Folinic:
Er, thanks. Can I ask your name...?

Severin:
Me? I'm off duty.

Folinic:
Um, what?

Severin:
I'm off duty. And I really don't want to talk so much when I'm off... I have my own business to deal with.

Severin:
That's the deal. Later.

Folinic:
And he's gone?

Suzuran:
He was kind of rude, but I think he's been through a lot...

Folinic:
Hah... as if we're not tired!

Folinic:
But at least he told us where to go. Let's go talk to the local—

Tatjana:
Schultz! There you are!

Tatjana:
The Infected are protesting again. The Gendarmerie are already on the scene, but they need you there leading them—

Tatjana:
Ah! You're smoking! Did the shopkeepers get to you again? Please, you have an image to maintain. You wouldn't want to lose the trust of the people—

Tatjana:
Hm? What is it?

Severin:
......

Folinic:
......

Suzuran:
...That's a... Schultz? A 'Schultheiß' is like a local leader?

Tatjana:
Is something wrong, Schultz?

Severin:
No. You're always working so hard, Tatjana. I admire you.

Tatjana:
Do you? Thank you—

Tatjana:
Now, about those two, they're not from around here, are they? Could they be the doctors from Rhodes Island?

Folinic:
Oh? Well, yes. We are indeed. I am Folinic and this is Suzuran.

Suzuran:
(Doctors?)

Folinic:
(I think we count.)

Suzuran:
(Even me?)

Folinic:
(I'm a fully-fledged operator assigned to the Medical Department. And Lisa, you've... studied with Dr. Kal'tsit, so we can call you a medical intern. I guess.)

Tatjana:
I see... Oh! You two must be on your way to the Rathaus? I'm so sorry to get in your way!

Tatjana:
Of course it should be the Schultz who receives you, but he really is needed at Zwölftontechnik Strasse... Er...

Folinic:
Oh, really, he can—

Severin:
Ahem! Very good, Tatjana, you take them. I'll go look into this Infected situation.

Severin:
You two.

Folinic:
—Yes?

Severin:
I know why you're here. But our situation is dire.

Severin:
Do you know what happened to Wolumonde?

Folinic:
The Great Rift.

Severin:
Yes. I get to skip over so much when dealing with smart people.

Severin:
So now the Infected are more riled up than ever before. If you don't want to get mixed up in that, stay away from Zwölftontechnik Strasse.

Folinic:
We are experts at dealing with the Infected.

Severin:
I know. We had a Dr. Atro from your company working closely with us.

Folinic:
So you know we can help.

Severin:
We don't need it yet. It wouldn't be right to drag our guests into this mess as soon as they've arrived. That would get us into trouble too.

Folinic:
...So what is Atro doing here?

Tatjana:
Um...

Severin:
She's not here right now.

Folinic:
So where is she?

Severin:
She...

Townsfolk:
Oh no! Fighting has broken out!

Townsfolk:
Th-those Infected have weapons! What's going on?!

Townsfolk:
They've got blades! Are they going to kill us?

Tatjana:
Schultz!

Severin:
...I know.

Severin:
You two are Infected experts, yes?

Severin:
Come with me.
