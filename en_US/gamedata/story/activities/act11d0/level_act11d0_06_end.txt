Mudrock:
......

Sarkaz Warrior:
We're going to let them use us for nothing?

Mudrock:
......

Sarkaz Warrior:
What's gonna happen if they really start calling themselves Reunion?

Mudrock:
They definitely will.

Mudrock:
We'll be hunted down.

Mudrock:
A town of this size can't do anything to us. But... What if it was an entire nomadic city?

Sarkaz Warrior:
If we took just one of the big Leithanian bankers, musicians, or aristocrats out of their fancy towers, we'd be set for life.

Mudrock:
Pride will ruin them.

Sarkaz Warrior:
It's the same pride that keeps Leithanien's aggressive streak in check.

Sarkaz Warrior:
We should avoid making trouble in Wolumonde. We will have nowhere else to go.

Mudrock:
We should not meet on the battlefield. This... this is no battlefield. Is it?

Mudrock:
You, all of you, your time grows short.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Um...? Who are you talking to?

Mudrock:
No.

Mudrock:
Just... musing.

Mudrock:
Winter is coming. And we will have no choice.

Click:
Ugh... I've got a bad feeling about this.

Severin:
Now, any more questions?

GreyThroat:
Just to be sure, how did you identify the eight corpses, Officer Severin?

Severin:
Body type, sex, approximate age, a list of the town's missing persons.

Severin:
But now is not the time to discuss the fire. We have more pressing issues at hand.

GreyThroat:
I don't disagree, but...

Folinic:
What have you got?

GreyThroat:
The number of Infected people who lost their lives in the fire was 'four,' according to the Reunion member we spoke to.

Severin:
Is there a reason we should care what the enemy has to say?

GreyThroat:
With all due respect, this does matter. 'Caring' what he says is different from 'trusting' it. We have a major risk of misunderstanding here.

Severin:
I still don't think this will solve the problem. Uncovering the truth about the fire will not improve our situation.

Folinic:
It means a lot to me.

Severin:
Then, with all due respect, Miss Folinic, you've been letting your emotions pull you around too much.

Folinic:
But you must—

Severin:
I fight for Wolumonde and Wolumonde alone. That is my duty. I'm not here to serve the justice in your heart.

Severin:
I have a responsibility to give the truth to Rhodes Island, not your thirst for revenge.

Folinic:
You—

Folinic:
—No, you're right...

Folinic:
I need to go calm down... I, I'll go help Lisa with the wounded.

Severin:
Then it's settled. Our top priority is to retake Zwölftontechnik Strasse.

Severin:
War is inevitable, at this point. Rhodes Island will need to focus on the fight for the automated Arts units, all while keeping a close eye on the Sarkaz and other partisans.

Severin:
Direct crowd control will be on us. The most difficult jobs, we give to you.

Ayerscarpe:
......

Severin:
Erm, did I say too much?

GreyThroat:
No. Tell me, what did you see in their eyes? The insurgents, and the angry townspeople.

GreyThroat:
If they managed to overwhelm us, that would be the end of the town of Wolumonde.

GreyThroat:
And regardless of what the truth may be, headlines around the world would read 'Reunion resurfaces and destroys a town in Leithanien.'

GreyThroat:
After so many sacrifices, so many goodbyes, I did not want to see it happen again.

GreyThroat:
Ayerscarpe, contact Click. It's time to regroup.

GreyThroat:
I'm going to check on the Infected captives.

Tatjana:
Schultz? I saw Miss Folinic already left. Is the meeting over?

Severin:
Yes. Thank you.

Severin:
They're getting loud out there.

Townsfolk:
They think they can destroy our homes and get away with it?!

Townsfolk:
They trashed my shop, and beat my children!

Townsfolk:
Those damned traitors! Ingrates! After all we gave them!

Townsfolk:
We have to fight back!

Townsfolk:
Fight back! Fight back! Fight back!

Fight back! Fight back! Fight back!

Severin:
Ugh. Look at them. Every one of them an avatar of justice.

Tatjana:
Uncle, you really shouldn't smoke...

Severin:
Doesn't matter.

Suzuran:
Okay, all better!

Suzuran:
That being said, you still have a mild infection. So don't go abusing Originium Arts!

Infected Captive:
Is that a joke? I'm a Leithanian. An educated Leithanian. How could I—

Suzuran:
No fighting!

Infected Captive:
No, it's not about fighting. Without Arts, I can't even use my refrigerator!

Suzuran:
You just use it normally, through the device. Don't irritate the Originium in your body. That way, you don't worsen your infection!

Infected Captive:
...I cheaped out and bought a second-hand one that needs a caster to operate...

Suzuran:
No!

Infected Captive:
Y-you're an outsider! What do you know? Will I ever get to lead a normal life? With what we're fighting against, we—

Suzuran:
Okay, okay. Just remember to take care of yourself so you don't get worse. You're still pretty healthy. And no more using Arts!

Infected Captive:
We're fighting against... Never mind. What can I say to a child...?

Suzuran:
All right. Next up...

Suzuran:
Oh, an old man? What's he doing here at his age...?

Old Man:
Heh heh. A nine-tailed Vulpo. That's something you don't see every day.

Old Man:
Hm. That reminds me. I've been hearing a lot of talk of Winterwisps and outlanders. Would that be you?

Suzuran:
Oh, yes. Can you tell me where you're hurt?

Old Man:
Hm? Oh, I'm not hurt. I'm just here to wait for death. I'm old, and getting sleepy...

Suzuran:
D-death? Let's not get too morbid here...

Old Man:
Child, I'm a Winterwisp. Last of the Winterwisp clansmen, in fact.

Suzuran:
What?!

Old Man:
Heh heh. You're awfully cute when you're shocked, child... And, I sense no hostility from you.

Suzuran:
The last...? But everyone's been saying the Winterwisps are helping the Infected rebels.

Old Man:
*Sigh*. It's only when they're so filled with hate that they think of their heritage. And that heritage is just an excuse. They hate something else altogether.

Old Man:
Would you indulge an old man for a minute? I'm already your prisoner, after all. I'm not going to do anything... ever again. I'm too old.

Suzuran:
Oh, um... As old as you are, I should treat you. Even if it's just a flesh wound.

Old Man:
Hah hah. I'm still pretty strong, in my old age... No, no. That's a lie.

Old Man:
My clansmen mostly went elsewhere. Or they intermarried with the people of Wolumonde.

Old Man:
In the end, how many real Winterwisps are left? Just a few of us old fogies.

Suzuran:
Sir... what did you do?

Old Man:
I... killed. Many people.

Old Man:
A traveling merchant who came to Wolumonde, a noble who dared to wander into the wilds... and so many more.

Old Man:
At first we thought it was justified. Proper vengeance...

Old Man:
So the old-timers did all the hard work. The younger ones just stood by. None of it meant anything to their lives anymore.

Old Man:
But vengeance. We couldn't kill the traitors. We couldn't kill the rotten nobles. It turns out, we could only unleash our hatred on so many innocents.

Old Man:
We couldn't defeat Leithanien. Not its laws, not the mighty roar of the engines of its nomadic cities.

Old Man:
We started giving up. I escaped into Wolumonde, and Severin picked off the other old clansmen one by one. He's a hunter. Never wavers.

Old Man:
But they say he'll sit with a dying enemy and have one last smoke with him. Too bad today's manufactured cigarettes are awful.

Old Man:
As for me, I built myself a nest out of scavenged tin, underneath Wolumonde. Severin didn't get the last one, in the end.

Old Man:
Am I afraid to die? Nay. Believe me, little Vulpo girl, I'm not afraid.

Old Man:
I just want to hear the sound of a town's power plant roaring to life, after my own lifetime of fruitless revenge.

Old Man:
Maybe someday Wolumonde will grow into a nomadic city, or maybe it'll die out.

Old Man:
But... Hah... I'm a Winterwisp. Was I furious the first time I saw that boiler heat up and send the town crawling away? Yes, but what could I do? I remember it. I just cried.

Old Man:
It surged, it scorched, it singed, unstoppable. What could I do with only my bow and a short sword? I fell in love with it... with this murder weapon...

Old Man:
But Biederman did it, treacherous boy. A Catastrophe Messenger, and an outsider, did what I'd never dare to do in my entire life...

Suzuran:
S-slow down, sir! Th-that Biederman you're talking about...

Suzuran:
I remember a Catastrophe Messenger in Leithanien by that name, but I think he died in the fire?

Old Man:
Hm? I'm not sure about that. He's the one giving the orders.

Suzuran:
So that means...?

Old Man:
Do you know that feeling of powerlessness?

Suzuran:
Huh?

Old Man:
When I watched Biederman... take the Infected, the Arts, the destruction... When I watched him ruin the power plant, I was completely powerless...

Old Man:
It turns out the thing that conquered us all those years ago was just a big hunk of iron... How weary I've become.

Old Man:
...Are you still there?

Suzuran:
Yes, I'm listening.

Old Man:
Don't rush to revenge. Don't fight. Listen to me, girl.

Old Man:
The Winterwisps aren't the reason for all this... At least, not anymore.

Old Man:
How many here in Wolumonde have the Winterwisp blood in their veins? We were the ones who built this place in the beginning.

Old Man:
Winterwisp, Winterwisp is Wolumonde... It's the moon... And they, they destroyed themselves...

Suzuran:
So that's the story.

Old Man:
Look, little Vulpo girl, do you see where the road leads?

Suzuran:
Up ahead? It's an ordinary road. It leads to the town hall.

Old Man:
No...

Old Man:
It leads to the mountains.

Old Man:
The long banner flies... twelve twists and turns in the trail... travelers and blowing snow... ah... the power plant...

Old Man:
Ahh... ...

Suzuran:
Right. I forgot.

Suzuran:
That is the way to the mountains.

Suzuran:
Good night.

Folinic:
......

Suzuran:
Did you hear that, Folinic?

Suzuran:
We've been going in circles.

Folinic:
A Catastrophe Messenger thought dead is actually leading the mob?

Folinic:
Biederman, huh...?

Mmm——♪ Mmmhmm——♪

Such a brittle little branch♪

Winterwisp, oh, Winterwisp♪

Weary of a long life, weary of a long death♪

Sing out your song, firm and strong~♪

Singing through summer~♪

And on through winter~♪

Winterwisp, oh, Winterwisp~♪
