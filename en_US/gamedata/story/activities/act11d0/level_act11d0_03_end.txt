Tatjana:
I can see the Rathaus spire from here! Thank goodness, it looks like everyone's safe!

Folinic:
Lisa, hurry!

Suzuran:
Okay!

Townsfolk:
Wh-what happened? Is there a fire?

Townsfolk:
My sons haven't come back. Has anyone seen them?!

Townsfolk:
Where are the Gendarmerie?! Where is Severin?! Isn't he supposed to be a hero? And he's missing at a time like this?!

Suzuran:
Everyone's panicking!

Folinic:
But it looks like they haven't attacked the residential areas. Someone must be leading them!

Tatjana:
Everyone's been on edge for far too long. That explosion was all they needed to snap—

Tatjana:
Over here! We have to make sure the Rathaus is secure!

Tatjana:
Look! There's a lot of them! Hurry!

Armed Infected:
Hah?!

Armed Infected:
Not bad for a man your age. Must be nice to live without the constant torment of Oripathy, huh?

Severin:
Sure... If I gave up smoking in my younger days, you and your friends would be sharing a jail cell by now.

Severin:
Get out of here. Out of respect for you as my fellow townsfolk, I won't—

Armed Infected:
Hah! Look at the mouth on this one! You think we don't know you're the last cop in Wolumonde?

Severin:
You...

Armed Infected:
Severin! The jig is up. Let us into the Rathaus so we can run our town already.

Severin:
What do you plan to do?

Armed Infected:
Hah?!

Severin:
Settle down. Truce. I'm going to smoke a cigarette while you tell me what exactly you want from this town. Go ahead.

Severin:
Maybe Wolumonde can consider your demands.

Armed Infected:
What are you trying to pull?

Severin:
Look, I'm putting down my sword. I think we can come to terms here. No need to fight.

Armed Infected:
Hah. Now you decide to be reasonable?

Armed Infected:
Hand over the murderer. And abandon your prejudices.

Armed Infected:
...I want to go home. And I want my job back. Simple enough?

Severin:
I just need you to fill out a report, and submit to regular physicals. Simple enough.

Armed Infected:
That's it?! You walled us in and left us to die!

Armed Infected:
All that's left of my block is a heap of earthquake rubble. It's all Originium clusters that could blow at any moment. You evacuated all the non-infected and we're running out of supplies. Is anyone coming to help us?

Armed Infected:
Oh right, I almost forgot. Because you suck at your job, Wolumonde is heading straight to hell, and we're just the first ones to be thrown under the bus.

Armed Infected:
You still think you're so bright, hiding the truth to 'maintain order?'

Severin:
...*Sigh*.

Severin:
Looks like my matches got wet. I guess I don't have a light. Let's get back to it.

Armed Infected:
Wha?! Hand-to-hand?

Severin:
Sure. Just a quick whiff of tobacco is enough to pump me up.

Severin:
But, I'm sorry to say, we may be about to have an 'accident' here.

Armed Infected:
Damn it, let go! Are... Are you trying to kill me? Gah—!

Severin:
No, just a 'slip' of the hand—

Tatjana:
Schultz!

Severin:
Hm?

Tatjana:
Um...

Severin:
Finished. There were only a few of them, and the rest ran off, leaving this poor fella alone.

Folinic:
Did you kill him?

Severin:
I don't think so.

Folinic:
......

Severin:
It would be nice if the good doctors could wake him up.

Suzuran:
He's breathing!

Folinic:
Let's make sure we're saving lives now.

Folinic:
I'll have words for you soon, 'Schultz.'

Severin:
Sure. I'm all ears, Miss.

Tatjana:
Sir...

Severin:
I told you before, I'm not 'Sir.' I'm not your Schultz when we're alone. I'm Thor's father, and your uncle.

Tatjana:
No, Sir, you just... you were going to kill that Infected man.

Severin:
I won't deny it.

Tatjana:
That's only going to make things worse! And you can't attack a member of the Wolumonde family so lightly!

Severin:
Even if he told the militants that we're defenseless?

Severin:
You know what this means, Tatjana.

Tatjana:
You should have a heart, at least—

Severin:
Can't always make the right choice, no matter how much you might want to. Not unless you're omniscient.

Severin:
Objectively speaking, if a prophet or a banker baron told me just a few deaths would bring peace back to Wolumonde...

Severin:
I'd do it. No matter who had to die.

Tatjana:
...Even if...

Severin:
No. Matter. Who.

Severin:
...At least he managed to hold on to his life. That's good enough.

Severin:
Let's get back to Rhodes Island. Did you tell them the truth? Did you already take them to the camp? That girl had a different look in her eye.

Tatjana:
You already knew...?

Severin:
I was pretty sure. For what it's worth, I never saw the point in hiding it from them. But keeping it under wraps myself calmed a lot of people down.

Severin:
What's your read on them?

Tatjana:
I think they'll help Wolumonde. They're the same kind of people as Dr. Atro.

Severin:
*Cough* *cough*, *hack*. And you think they speak for all of Rhodes Island?

Tatjana:
They're the ones they sent. So I guess they should be decently representative?

Severin:
Truth be told, if every Rhodes Island operator we ran into turned out to be a good person, that would disturb me a lot more.

Severin:
I'm thinking back... to a certain sniper. She was from Rhodes Island...

Tatjana:
The one who came with Dr. Atro and left shortly thereafter?

Tatjana:
I hope she didn't get swallowed up by the Catastrophe...

Tatjana:
Wh-what? Another attack?

Severin:
At this point, every bandit for miles must know we have no Gendarmerie here.

Severin:
So what can we do? Get down on our knees and beg for mercy? Or fight to the bitter end?

Tatjana:
No, those explosions are coming from... underground?!

Townsfolk:
Severin! They're over at the workshops! They came through a tunnel on the next street over!

Townsfolk:
They crippled the main power plant!

???:
Look at it. A beautiful, empty town.

???:
Wolumonde. Moon of the Winterwisp Mountains. Yes, truly worthy of its name.

Armed Infected:
A moon? Pfah!

Armed Infected:
Four of our people died in that fire.

Armed Infected:
And they have the gall to try to pin it on the Infected? What's next? Where do they go from here?

Armed Infected:
Do they just expect us to turn the other cheek?

Mudrock:
You're quite worked up. Try to relax. You don't usually talk like that.

Armed Infected:
We should level this place! Damned Wolumonders! Damned immigrants!

Mudrock:
No.

Armed Infected:
Mudrock! You and your Sarkaz could do it!

Mudrock:
No.

Mudrock:
You're right... Who knows the pain of losing one's home better than the Sarkaz?

Mudrock:
Even in Leithanien, where the Infected are supposed to be able to do what they can with what they have, there is no place for the Sarkaz.

Mudrock:
...But, the cupcakes that nice granny gave us were delicious. Just the right amount of sweet.

Armed Infected:
Huh?

Mudrock:
So... We wait. The only thing we're here to destroy is the murderer. We can't lose control of our hate. Or else...

Mudrock:
What separates us from what we were before?
