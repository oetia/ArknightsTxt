Tatjana:
Nng...

Tatjana:
Where am I...?

Tatjana:
Argh—!

Tatjana:
(So dizzy...! But I can see... and hear.)

Tatjana:
(I can't feel... my ankle.)

Tatjana:
(It's so quiet. Where did everyone go?)

Tatjana:
(......)

Tatjana:
(Silent as the grave... Did the rioters just leave me here?)

GreyThroat:
You're awake.

Tatjana:
Aaah?!

GreyThroat:
Calm down.

Tatjana:
Oh, sorry! You startled me.

Tatjana:
Huh? You... I know you. You're from Rhodes Island.

GreyThroat:
GreyThroat, Operator.

GreyThroat:
Keep your voice down. We took care of the rebels in this area.

Tatjana:
Took care of them...?

GreyThroat:
Even at this point, you still don't see them as the enemy.

GreyThroat:
Relax, most of them are still alive. Handed over to Officer Severin Hawthorn.

Tatjana:
...Thanks.

Tatjana:
Oh, um... What about Miss Folinic?

GreyThroat:
She's fine. I sent another operator to help her. But...

GreyThroat:
Did Atro really... sacrifice herself?

Tatjana:
...Yes. I'm sorry.

GreyThroat:
That explains the way Folinic has been acting...

Tatjana:
Just a few operators won't be able to retake this neighborhood on their own. We should fall back to the town center and regroup.

GreyThroat:
Right. Can you walk? You injured your ankle.

Tatjana:
I... I can try. Ow...

GreyThroat:
Here, let me help.

Tatjana:
Thanks...

GreyThroat:
One more question, Miss Tatjana. When I came here with Atro, Wolumonde was still thriving.

GreyThroat:
So what happened to all the Gendarmerie? There isn't a single one left in town.

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Hng!

Ayerscarpe:
Put down your weapon. Look at yourself. You don't even have a decent set of clothes. You're going to fight like that?

Rebellious Townsfolk:
What do you outsiders know? What do you even get out of helping those noble puppets?!

Folinic:
Nothing. I'm not interested in your politics at all. But... are you a Winterwisp?

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Winterwisp...? Hah. I'm not aboriginal, but I do acknowledge their struggle!

Rebellious Townsfolk:
How about you? Dr. Atro was a good person, but you? You're just here to help them crush us!

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Wolumonde, no, all of Leithanien is rotten to the core! Today they burn the Infected alive, tomorrow it will be the entire working class!

Folinic:
......

Ayerscarpe:
Where's your proof?

Rebellious Townsfolk:
There's not a single Gendarmerie in Wolumonde! Not one!

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Why do you think that is?

Ayerscarpe:
Wolumonde and several surrounding towns formed a collective settlement network. When the Catastrophe struck, there were not enough Gendarmerie to care for all of the—

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Oh really? If it was that simple, nobody would mind!

Folinic:
Enough stalling. Out with it.

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Hmph.

Rebellious Townsfolk:
For a wedding.

Ayerscarpe:
A wedding?

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Some great nobleman in his high tower married the only daughter of another nobleman, so they sent all the Gendarmerie over to the nearest nomadic city!

Rebellious Townsfolk:
And how long do you think the aristocrats' drunken revelries are gonna last? You wanna guess?

Ayerscarpe:
......

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Oh and I almost forgot about the part where the nobles argued back and forth for a month about whose city should move to whose territory.

Rebellious Townsfolk:
So our Gendarmerie had to go stand around some fancy mansions to boost a fortunate son's ego, and maybe keep out the riffraff. Isn't that funny? Are you laughing?

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Because I'm not.

Folinic:
No, it's not funny. But that still doesn't give me any leads as to the fire.

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Hmph...

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Think about it: who's going to set fire to a medical camp that treats Infected? Would the Infected do that?

Rebellious Townsfolk:
It could only be someone who wants to see the Infected suffer. You should be on our side—

Rebellious Townsfolk:
—The side of Reunion!

Townsfolk:
Schultz! The rebels refuse to surrender!

Severin:
There aren't many of them...

GreyThroat:
The truly horrific thing about this disaster is that both sides are ordinary civilians. There are no warriors here.

GreyThroat:
We should do everything we can to avoid the worst case scenario.

Suzuran:
GreyThroat! Miss Tatjana! You're back!

Folinic:
And we're going to make the murderer pay for their crimes.

Severin:
Tatjana!

Tatjana:
Uncle... I'm sorry. I was careless...

Severin:
No... All that matters is that you're safe.

GreyThroat:
Operator Folinic. Glad to see you safe and sound.

Folinic:
GreyThroat, I recall it was you who came with Atro to Wolumonde?

Folinic:
Do you know what happened?

GreyThroat:
...I've got the gist of it.

Folinic:
Do you think... If you were with her, that things would've turned out differently?

Ayerscarpe:
Folinic, you shouldn't—

GreyThroat:
No. The myriad contradictions this crisis has revealed in Wolumonde can't be solved by external forces. There is nothing we could've done.

Folinic:
......

GreyThroat:
But at least... I should have been there with her, to do what I could.

GreyThroat:
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't with her.

Folinic:
No... *Sigh*. It was wrong of me to push that on you just to make myself feel better. What the hell am I doing...?

Folinic:
I'm the one who should be sorry.

Severin:
People.

Severin:
Let me start by offering my sincere thanks to Rhodes Island for saving Tatjana.

Folinic:
Rhodes Island is an organization dedicated to helping the Infected.

Folinic:
Severin Hawthorn, Leithanien is known for its lenient treatment of the Infected. But I still have to ask, before we get down to business—

Folinic:
On behalf of Wolumonde, can you guarantee that Wolumonde has not, in light of these exceptional circumstances, taken 'additional measures' against the Infected population?

Severin:
The investigations you carried out with Miss Suzuran should have corroborated this.

Severin:
Wolumonde has in no way, at no point, targeted the Infected. Nor have we ever held ill will toward Dr. Atro, who aided the Infected.

Severin:
Are you satisfied?

Folinic:
......

Suzuran:
Miss Folinic, I believe Mr. Severin.

Ayerscarpe:
Why?

Suzuran:
Um... well... I'm not sure! But I do believe him! He wouldn't hurt Infected people!

Folinic:
Okay, Lisa. I'll trust your instincts, for now.

Severin:
Thank you for understanding.

Severin:
Now, I'd like to hear your opinions on what to do next.

GreyThroat:
I'm not as familiar with the field as Folinic. I followed her instructions during the operation.

Folinic:
There aren't a lot of them out there.

Folinic:
Counting those we have successfully subdued, there can't be more than a hundred or so.

Severin:
A hundred or so rioters wouldn't be able to terrorize Wolumonde under normal circumstances.

Folinic:
As for the Gendarmerie, I've heard some interesting rumors.

Severin:
That was one of the very few unfortunate decisions I've made in my military career. We can't do anything about it, so let's shelve it for now.

Ayerscarpe:
Allow me to interject. I'd like to discuss that captive, who called himself 'Reunion.'

Suzuran:
Huh?

GreyThroat:
We have made contact with a certain lone member of the Reunion Movement, and he has very little in common with the outraged citizenry.

GreyThroat:
He's a battle-hardened warrior. And if he came with a squad, he could be a problem.

Severin:
The partisans. This is not good news.

Folinic:
Reunion...

Folinic:
Chernobog... Ursus... Gah... Not Ursus again...

Folinic:
Why should I believe a single word they say?!

GreyThroat:
......

Ayerscarpe:
The fire was the trigger for all of this. But there was always a high risk of conflict.

Ayerscarpe:
Did these underlying problems cause the fire? Or was this fire the catalyst that revealed these problems?

Tatjana:
Do we have a choice...? Do we have to fight?

Severin:
This is the choice that decides the fate of Wolumonde. Thousands of lives hang in the balance. We can't be hasty.

Severin:
We should return to the Rathaus for a formal resolution.

Severin:
Hm. But it looks like the other side won't give us the chance.

Folinic:
If Reunion really is here, there's no need for a light touch.

Ayerscarpe:
......

GreyThroat:
Roger that. However, Folinic, you should stay here and tend to the wounded.

Folinic:
I'd rather get in there my—

GreyThroat:
Lisa, Operator Suzuran, is not a fully accredited medic operator. Only you are.

GreyThroat:
You should prioritize protecting the innocent over defeating the enemy.

Folinic:
I...

Suzuran:
Miss Folinic... You should stay here.

Suzuran:
If you keep fighting that hard, that aggressively, you won't be you anymore.

Folinic:
......

Folinic:
Right... okay. I'll... stay.
