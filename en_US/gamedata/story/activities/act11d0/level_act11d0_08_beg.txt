Townsfolk A:
Tatjana! They broke the last Gramophone! There's nothing we can do against those giants!

Townsfolk B:
Hey! The rioters started burning houses! Bastards... and the fire's spreading!

Townsfolk B:
Where are Tatjana and Severin?! At a time like this!

Tatjana:
Schultz Severin is... wounded. He's resting.

Townsfolk A:
He's resting while we're out here risking our lives—

Townsfolk B:
Quiet! We can't be fighting each other right now. Look around you, moron!

Townsfolk A:
Who's a moron?! I don't see you doing anything with your Arts!

Tatjana:
S-stop! We need defensive Arts in place to regain control of each jurisdiction.

Townsfolk B:
Caster on the east side down! We need another one up there!

Tatjana:
Careful!

Townsfolk A:
Fire! Incoming!

Townsfolk B:
Help meeaaaaaaaaahhh!

Townsfolk A:
P-put it out! Does anyone have some way of dousing the flames?!

Townsfolk B:
It burns! Help meee!

Townsfolk B:
Tatjana... Save... me....

Tatjana:
Ahhh... Gaaaaahhhh!!

Any actual words are swallowed up by bloodcurdling screams.

The smell of charred flesh is among the most chilling odors one can experience.

The man, engulfed in flames, slowly loses his form, leaving behind only a darkened, shadow-like corpse.

He struggles to cry out as his skin sears and his blood boils.

He reaches towards me in unspeakable agony, begging me to save him.

But...

But... Did Thor go through that same pain?

Townsfolk:
Tatjana! Focus! You're too far out! Careful!

Tatjana:
Huh?

Armed Infected:
Lucky me! Another noble lapdog to burn alive!

Tatjana:

Mudrock:
......

Sarkaz Warrior:
Chaos. The town is all sliced up into nice little pieces, like a cake.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Now, the last piece is crumbling to bits. They can't stop us.

Sarkaz Warrior:
And even if we stopped ourselves. Even if we packed up and left. Do they really think they could survive?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Leithanien will leave them to die.

Sarkaz Warrior:
The nearest nomadic city has 24 of those towers, and not a single lord can spare a glance for the dying little town in the Winterwisp Mountains.

Mudrock:
Tragic.

Mudrock:
There was a time when we grew weary of such tragedy. Let's not forget, standing here.

Mudrock:
Think things through.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Sure. Say, why don't you ever talk like this? I'm just complaining.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Complaining that we held out so long, biding our time, and nothing changed, in the end. It all went to hell.

Sarkaz Warrior:
It's just so anti-climactic. I'm disappointed.

Townsfolk:
They're pushing in!

Suzuran:
Huh!

Suzuran:
I- I'm coming!

Armed Infected:
Shit! Tough nut to crack!

Armed Infected:
Where did that Vulpo come from? Are those nine tails I'm seeing?

Armed Infected:
No way! She's Infected! Why is she with them?!

Armed Infected:
So young... After all you've suffered, shouldn't you be fighting back?!

Suzuran:
...

Armed Infected:
Comrade! Don't be deceived! Fight the power!

Armed Infected:
They are the criminals who chain and oppress us!

Suzuran:
You...

Armed Infected:
Hm?

Suzuran:
You... don't know anything!

Townsfolk:
She, she sent them flying?

Townsfolk:
The Arts around her slowed down? Where do those Arts come from? I've never seen it in the books.

Suzuran:
You can't decide someone else's fate. Rhodes Island, Mom and Dad, everyone's always been so good to me!

Suzuran:
And you! Don't sneak up on me!

Armed Infected:
Agh...! I can't... move...!

Suzuran:
Hnng!

Suzuran:
Stop...

Suzuran:
Stop ruining things for everyone! Think about all the pain you're causing everyone else!

GreyThroat:
...So, what's next?

Folinic:
Biederman... the culprit is dead.

GreyThroat:
We have no hard evidence until Click and Ayerscarpe return...

Folinic:
Then who is the real killer? What is actually happening here?

GreyThroat:
Now is not the time to discuss that. We have to put down the riot first.

Folinic:
......

GreyThroat:
Folinic?

Folinic:
I... I don't know what to do...

GreyThroat:
I understand.

GreyThroat:
It's ridiculous, ironic, and hopeless. A doctor dedicated to healing the Infected died in the midst of an Infected riot.

GreyThroat:
I've been fuming about it... more than anyone.

Suzuran:
Hnng!

Suzuran:
Why? Why does it have to be this way? Why doesn't anyone know what's happening here?

Suzuran:
Killing each other doesn't solve anything! You're all going to die!

Armed Infected:
Get out of my way! I will go through you if I have to, kid or not!

Suzuran:
I'm not moving!

Suzuran:
You have to listen to me!

Armed Infected:
Listen to what? Are you playing judge here? Who are you to determine what's right and what's wrong?

Armed Infected:
How do you think we got here? Plenty of wannabe philosophers out there railing about the era, the country, and human nature. They don't know shit.

Armed Infected:
But if you're walking down the road and a highwayman with a knife asks you for some charity...

Armed Infected:
Are you gonna have a heart-to-heart about Leithanien's corruption? Or about Rim Billiton's blood-soaked operations?

Armed Infected:
No!

Suzuran:
Uh oh...! I can't... hold out much longer...!

Armed Infected:
He's thinking about how to kill you and get away with it. And you're thinking about whether you should shoot first, or try to put a little distance between you.

Armed Infected:
Nine times out of ten, you're just trying to make it out alive.

Armed Infected:
There's always little people to sacrifice. Turns out they're people like us, not like you.

Armed Infected:
You rest easy, talk about your ideals, complain about the shitty state of the world. You talk about the big picture. The real enemy is far away, so you don't deal with the problems right in front of you. Hah!

Armed Infected:
It's working! Keep it up!

Suzuran:
But you're all innocent! It's not like you all wanted this...

Armed Infected:
Innocent? Pfft. I don't need your sympathy. None of us are innocent. Piss off.

Armed Infected:
We're doing what it takes to survive. Even if that means somebody else can't. There's no charity in survival.

Suzuran:
——!

Armed Infected:
Hey! What's up with that nine-tailed Vulpo girl?!

Armed Infected:
Target her! Quick!

Armed Infected:
Gah! My staff... it snapped! Where did that bolt come from?!

GreyThroat:
We're here.

GreyThroat:
Ayerscarpe and Click should be out there evacuating civilians. As for us...

GreyThroat:
Folinic?

Folinic:
...Reunion.

Folinic:
I know what I heard. They were cheering that Reunion liberated them.

GreyThroat:
But they're not...

Folinic:
No!

Folinic:
They're the core of this riot. Get rid of them and it falls apart!

Folinic:
If it weren't for them, Atro would still be alive!

GreyThroat:
Folinic!

Folinic:
...

GreyThroat:
Calm down.

Folinic:
Sorry.

Folinic:
This isn't your first time. It's not mine... either.

Folinic:
I'm just... at a loss.

Folinic:
Let's go. Rhodes Island is going to find a way to stop this riot.

Sarkaz Warrior:
It's Rhodes Island. You put all your hopes in a bunch of kids, huh?

Sarkaz Warrior:
They're so green. They didn't even get here in time to stop all this. It's already over.

Mudrock:
...But they are warriors.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Oh?

Mudrock:
Warriors, who have known the battlefield.

Mudrock:
Have the others withdraw.

Mudrock:
We will go.

The Sarkaz tears off the Reunion symbol and raises a hand, causing crumbling rocks to once again gather together.

The battlefield falls silent. The rioters give way, and the protesters retreat in fear.

Only Mudrock steps forward, but one step.
