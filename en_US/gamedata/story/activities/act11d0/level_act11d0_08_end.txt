Wounded Townsfolk:
Ah! Schultz! That's where you were!

Wounded Townsfolk:
I heard you were hurt. Are you being discharged?

Severin:
*cough*... There are so many wounded. If this keeps up, we'll run out of beds.

Severin:
Tatjana... how is Tatjana?

Wounded Townsfolk:
I- I'm not sure. I heard someone burned to death in front of her, and she...

Tatjana:
Urk... Ahhh...

Severin:
Let it out, child. Just let it all out.

Tatjana:
I- I'm sorry... I just...

Severin:
A good cry is healthy.

Tatjana:
But it's still chaos out there!

Severin:
I'll go. Between me, and the Rhodes Island team...

Severin:
We'll figure it out.

Tatjana:
No... Don't tell me...

Severin:
Take her to a bed. I'm taking command.

Wounded Townsfolk:
Of course.

Tatjana:
Uncle...! Promise me! Promise me you won't get yourself killed!

Tatjana:
It's pointless.

Severin:
It's pointless to even say it's pointless.

Severin:
Have some hope, at least. There's always a chance to turn things around.

Folinic:
Let me... through!

Townsfolk:
We did it! We shattered the giants!

Mudrock:
This persistence... unexpected.

Sarkaz Warrior:
If you keep holding back, we won't make it out in one piece.

Mudrock:
Your eyes are full of hatred, and emptiness.

Mudrock:
You are angry about Dr. Atro. But what of it?

Mudrock:
We all have our own baggage.

Folinic:
Shut up.

Folinic:
Don't you dare... speak her name.

Folinic:
Gah—!

Mudrock:
When winter comes, when the famine comes, you will still lose. No one will survive.

Mudrock:
Wolumonde... will end.

Folinic:
That goes without saying.

Mudrock:
Who is it you hate? Who are you going to save?

Folinic:
Grr! Those Arts again!

Mudrock Colossus:
Gaaaaaaaah!

Suzuran:
Folinic!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Delaying the time it takes for Mudrock's Arts to activate... what a strange ability.

Sarkaz Warrior:
But, do you really have the luxury to be getting distracted?

Suzuran:
Hey! L-let go of me!

Sarkaz Warrior:
You're lucky. If you were a few years older, I'd have already hacked off your dominant hand.

Folinic:
Suzuran?!

Mudrock:
Don't try to run.

Mudrock Colossus:
GRAAAAAAAHHHH—!

Severin:
You're just a medic. Don't try to fight.

Folinic:
Severin! You can't!

Mudrock:
Another... warrior.

Severin:
......

Severin:
We found the real murderer.

Severin:
The one behind everything! The traitor Biederman! Just moments ago brought to the Rathaus by the Rhodes Island operators!

Armed Infected:
......

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Wait, Biederman... Biederman's still alive? What are you talking about?

Armed Infected:
Don't listen to his bullshit! Does it even matter who the real murderer is?!

Armed Infected:
What we're fighting for is the end marginalization of the Infected, and the end to the aristocracy's exploitation of the working class! Winterwisp will rightfully reclaim its land!

Armed Infected:
We are Reunion! A new era begins today!

Mudrock:
Look, Severin, it's useless...

Severin:
Then kill me, Reunion. Let's have a good fight.

Mudrock:
And then what? Winter and famine will still destroy this city.

Severin:
No.

Severin:
It may be a dead end. But I'd rather believe Rhodes Island can keep things from getting worse.

Severin:
At least some will survive.

Severin:
You see how bruised and battered you are. Your mask is half broken. Your giant is falling apart. And you're exhausted, aren't you?

Severin:
I can tell. We're not so different, you and I.

Severin:
Say, got a light?

Mudrock:
......

Severin:
It'll be my last cigarette anyway... Forget it.

Severin:
(Do it. Now. Don't give them a chance to save me.)

Mudrock:
Severin Hawthorn, when you die, I will leave this place.

Mudrock:
This is a ghost town. Staying here is just waiting to die.

Mudrock:
I will tell them of your death. If they still wish to harm others, I shall personally deal with them.

Severin:
...Fair enough.

Mudrock:
Farewell.

Mudrock:
These Arts, what is this power...?

Suzuran:
Wh-why... must you die?

Severin:
Get out of here, girl!

Suzuran:
Don't die!

Severin:
I have to... so that others can live!

Armed Infected:
Hey! Mudrock's in trouble! Let's go help him! Don't let up!

Armed Infected:
B-but they even broke the colossi...

Ayerscarpe:
Surrender.

Ayerscarpe:
Sarkaz is lost. What do you have to fight for?

Armed Infected:
Hmph...

Ayerscarpe:
If you just need to vent your frustration, fine. I volunteer.

Ayerscarpe:
Until you're satisfied.

Armed Infected:
Hurry! Fire up the Gramophone!

Armed Infected:
I, I don't know Leithanian Arts. Go get us a Leithanian. What, what's that up there? A drone?!

Armed Infected:
Don't look up! Look behind you! There's something with red eyes...

Click:
You probably shouldn't move. GreyThroat has you in her sights.

Click:
Oh and you don't want to turn around and look for her either. I'm watching you too.

Mudrock:
You seethe. You protect. How many times is this?

Mudrock:
You... Heh, you actually beat me.

GreyThroat:
Drop your weapon. You're not getting away this time, Mudrock.

Mudrock:
......

Severin:
You'll leave them hating Wolumonde same as they always did!

GreyThroat:
Doesn't matter. They don't really want change. They only care about what's good for them.

GreyThroat:
They could have worked together to get through the crisis. They didn't. They didn't care about the truth. They just wanted to loot and riot.

GreyThroat:
Miss Tatjana is right. Even if you sacrifice yourself, it won't help anything.

GreyThroat:
No matter how complex the backstory here is, a Rhodes Island operator won't sit by while Infected rioters destroy a town.

Folinic:
A town Atro wanted to protect.

Folinic:
A Rhodes Island op team will die defending this plaza, this town hall.

Folinic:
Really, this might lead to so much more death...

Folinic:
But that's after. After 'you' and after 'us.'

Folinic:
As long as we're still here, we'll fight to the end. So Atro can rest in peace.

Sarkaz Warrior:
......

Mudrock:
......

Armed Infected:
......

Mudrock:
You really have defeated me... Maybe you can actually defend this tower to the death. But... why?

Folinic:
Many will die.

Folinic:
Just like Atro. A meaningless death.

Mudrock:
The Infected have a reason to fight.

Folinic:
There's always a justification. But for now, you're not solving the problem. You're only causing destruction.

Folinic:
After the Catastrophe struck Wolumonde, with supplies low and manpower short, what did you do?

Folinic:
Tell me. Tell me what you did!

Mudrock:
......

GreyThroat:
You were told not to move.

GreyThroat:
Your Arts are so sloppy that at this distance, my crossbow is enough to incapacitate you.

Mudrock:
Rhodes Island...

Mudrock:
What led to that fire? And what did that fire lead to?

Folinic:
The mastermind is already dead.

Mudrock:
Is he?

Mudrock:
......

Mudrock:
Retreat.

Armed Infected:
What? But we just...

Mudrock:
I said, retreat.

Mudrock:
Only a few... can pass through the Great Rift and return to the land of warmth.

Mudrock:
It doesn't matter if you want to take back your land or get revenge on the rich... You will only end up a corpse in the snow.

Mudrock:
Do you want to spend the winter burning with rage? Do you want to warm yourselves with a fire fed with the bodies of innocents?

Mudrock:
The murderer is dead. It's time to leave.

Rebellious Townsfolk:
B-but we have to take back Wolumonde! It's our land!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Quiet, Winterwisp. All you want is power. You want to cower behind the strong and pick up whatever scraps of power we leave behind.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Don't question the leader. Wise up, or you'll be six feet under.

Rebellious Townsfolk:
Err...

Armed Infected:
This isn't over!

Armed Infected:
We lost so many people! Are we going to leave like that? With our tails between our legs? Just because of a few words?

Mudrock:
Calm him down, friends.

Graaaaagh...

Armed Infected:
Gaaaah! A.... fist...?!

Sarkaz Warrior:
A stone fist from underground? You still have the strength?

Sarkaz Warrior:
You don't need to go that far just to stop them. They were on our side until a minute ago.

Mudrock:
I wanted to scare them, but... never mind...

Sarkaz Warrior:
And stop calling your Arts monsters 'friends.' It's creepy.

Mudrock:
You don't have to listen. Leave me alone.

Mudrock:
I have decided to retreat. I can't force you all to listen, but...

Mudrock:
I am leaving. Those who follow me are also leaving.

Mudrock:
Those who stay... you're on your own.

Mudrock:
By the way, do you have a match?

Sarkaz Warrior:
They might be wet. Those casters back there were a real pain.

Mudrock:
Give a light to that Severin man.

Mudrock:
Defeated warriors... are lucky to leave the battlefield alive. Don't dawdle.

Armed Infected:
Pfah! Forget about Reunion then! It's only a matter of time before we take the Rathaus. This town needs us!

Armed Infected:
Surrender, Severin!

Severin:
I told you they wouldn't go down easily *cough* *cough*—

Severin:
They're coming! Eyes left!

Suzuran:
Get behind me.

Folinic:
Ugh. Bunch of lunatics.

Folinic:
Rhodes Island is protecting this place. You have to go through us.

GreyThroat:
They're going to use Arts. Prepare the defenses. Target the casters.

Sarkaz Warrior:
——

Armed Infected:
Wh- what? They blocked my Arts?

Armed Infected:
Why are you doing this?!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Leader's orders.

Armed Infected:
Even if we have to fight you, devil, we're not giving up!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Hah.

Folinic:
What happened? Are they fighting each other?

Folinic:
Wait... Mudrock... stopped moving?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Leader?

Mudrock:
Earth.

Mudrock:
Arise...

Sarkaz Warrior:
Stop, Mudrock. You're burning through your own life.

Mudrock:
Doesn't matter.

Sarkaz Warrior:
You don't have to use that ancient power—

Mudrock:
I said... Arise!

All the rubble begins to condense into a single point.

A giant, looking out over the distant mountains.

Mudrock, however, stands motionless.

Suzuran:
It's... huge!

GreyThroat:
A last gasp. Its body is collapsing. He pushed himself too hard.

GreyThroat:
Fall back. Don't be hasty.

GreyThroat:
......

GreyThroat:
N-no... Mudrock already spent all his energy. These Arts...

GreyThroat:
That's Sarkaz... witchcraft?

Mudrock:
(I said...)

Mudrock Colossus:
I said...

Sarkaz Warrior:
This is way too dangerous. You're sharing your life with your own creation. It's not worth it just to subdue them.

Mudrock:
......

Sarkaz Warrior:
Fine. As you wish.

Mudrock:
(Shed your hate and strife. Live. This is your last chance to escape.)

Mudrock Colossus:
Leave this place.

Mudrock:
(Those who still fight... only seek death for all.)

Mudrock Colossus:
So... come destroy me.

Mudrock:
Come defeat me!

Armed Infected:
Wh-why...? Didn't he come to help us? Is he not Reunion?!

Armed Infected:
I... I don't care! Screw him!

Sarkaz Warrior:
In the past... we helped you. That fire unsettled us all.

Sarkaz Warrior:
We joined you, we guided you, but not for the sake of their deaths. Only for the sake of our lives.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Now, sadly, it looks like we're not on the same side.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Killing innocent people, and Rhodes Island's warriors, that's not our way.

Sarkaz Warrior:
And if we're dealing with a bunch of rioters who don't follow orders, why show mercy?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Us, the Sarkaz, the 'devils,' we're enough to take on anyone.

Sarkaz Warrior:
More than enough.

Ayerscarpe:
What happened? Everything got quiet as soon as that giant appeared.

Click:
So uh, that mountain-sized monster is a kind of Originium Art?

Ayerscarpe:
Let's figure out how to get back to Folinic.

Armed Infected:
Gah! Damn it!

Armed Infected:
Come on, let's go. This town is done for. We have to find a way over the Great Rift before winter sets in!

Armed Infected:
Abandon the town, Winterwisp clansmen, workers, and Infected.

Armed Infected:
There are other places to exact our revenge. Leave Wolumonde to its fate!

Armed Infected:
There's no reason to fight the Sarkaz. Fall back.

Armed Infected:
Let's go.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Mudrock, that's enough!

Mudrock:
——!

Mudrock:
Phew... Haah... Haah...

Sarkaz Warrior:
They stopped... That was crazy. Since when are we in the conflict mediation business?

Mudrock:
Look at this town... We, brought chaos.

Sarkaz Warrior:
It's not what we intended, but a rebellion is about self-interest, at its core. Not so many people come with high-minded ideals.

Mudrock:
You're right... So what do we do with our struggle...? With our deceased?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Loss and pain follow us everywhere.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Erm, just a second... I found a spare match.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Hey, Gendarmerie, here.

Severin:
......!

Severin:
Huh. Do Sarkaz warriors smoke?

Sarkaz Warrior:
I already quit.

Severin:
How about that. Looks like everyone who quits still carries matches.

Mudrock:
Cherish your life.

Mudrock:
And you, Rhodes Islanders...

Mudrock:
......

Folinic:
......

Mudrock:
It's time... to say goodbye.

Mudrock:
Maybe... just maybe, you can find a way to help these people.

Mudrock:
But none of that has anything to do with the Sarkaz anymore.

To the sound of crumbling rock, the Sarkaz turn and leave.

The entire block is burning.

The mob is gone, having left only out of fear.

The last chunk tumbles to the ground.
