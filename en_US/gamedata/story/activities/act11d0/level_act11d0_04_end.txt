Mama? Mama, where are you going?

To the highlands? The flowery highlands?

But that's where the bad man who hurt Papa is? Are you going to punish him?

Will that bring Papa back?

No?

Then... I don't want you to go.

You have to go? But I don't want you to go back to Ursus... The bread there is so hard. And winter is so cold.

Mama?

Mama...

......

......

Mama never came back either.

I used the money she left me to continue my studies in Ursus, and to live.

Alone.

I waited alone for years. I lived alone for years.

Until Dr. Kal'tsit appeared before me. She said she was the head of a research institute, and she came to get me.

Dr. Kal'tsit was tired then. Even more tired than she is now. I later learned she had just returned from some faraway place when she found me.

After that, I joined Rhodes Island.

I asked Dr. Kal'tsit where Mama went. She didn't say much, just that Mama and Papa were together, buried deep inside Ursus.

She is my most respected teacher, my most honored leader. She guided me, educated me, not only with her words, but also through what she and her countless operators did for the Infected.

But the one thing Dr. Kal'tsit never did... was answer my simplest question...

On whom, or what, do I take my revenge?

Folinic:
Lisa, you don't have to come with me.

Suzuran:
I'm worried.

Folinic:
You shouldn't be. I'm just going to look around and see if maybe there are some clues about that armed Infected group.

Suzuran:
Do you think they're behind it?

Folinic:
I'm not sure. That's the obvious answer, since we have no evidence.

Folinic:
But with the town as it is, they're the most likely suspects, aren't they?

Folinic:
And 'Winterwisp.' Severin wouldn't say much about it, so I can't be sure exactly what it means. But since they're in cahoots with the militia group, they're at the top of the list too.

Suzuran:
The mountain range near here is called the Winterwisp Mountains. It's a barren place, covered with ice and snow year round... could that have to do with anything?

Folinic:
I really don't know. All I can say for sure is I have to find our murderer, and then pull my answers out of them.

Suzuran:
Folinic, you've been really... scary. Since yesterday.

Folinic:
I'm sorry, Lisa.

Folinic:
Not everyone is so easily calmed.

Folinic:
This is the second time I've had to say goodbye to someone like that. And this time, I'm not leaving with regrets.

Mudrock:
Hm...

Mudrock:
Come out. I won't hurt you.

Click:
Aww. I like to think I'm pretty good at hiding. How did you see me?

Mudrock:
Hmm... Intuition? Let's call it that...

Mudrock:
Who are you?

Click:
(Oof. This guy seems like a pain in the ass.)

Ayerscarpe:
(Then stop talking to him.)

Ayerscarpe:
I've gone through some of Rhodes Island's battle records. You're no ordinary Infected.

Mudrock:
Rhodes Island? So you are Rhodes Island Operators...?

Click:
What do we do? Fight?

Ayerscarpe:
GreyThroat isn't back yet... We have to stall him, at least.

Click:
——!

Ayerscarpe:
Calm down. Don't attack him. Click!

Ayerscarpe:
Don't do anything stupid!

Click:
Gah! I- I'm sorry!

Mudrock:
Hm...? Did I see your pupils flash red for a moment? Is that some kind of stress reaction?

Mudrock:
Did I scare you? Sorry. I just wanted you two to know, you can't fight me.

Mudrock:
If you are from Wolumonde, you'd better leave. It's dangerous. If angry Winterwisps or Infected found you... You'd be in mortal danger.

Ayerscarpe:
Thanks for the warning.

Ayerscarpe:
But why are you here?

Mudrock:
I just came to lay some flowers. And then I'll leave.

Ayerscarpe:
Is that an ordinary wildflower you're holding there?

Mudrock:
It's cold here in the fall. I dream a lot... I dream of these flowers. They're like the children of that snowy mountain... icy cold.

Mudrock:
Rest in peace.

Click:
(Did he really just come to pray? He wouldn't just be using this as a cover for some kind of Originium Arts, would he?)

Ayerscarpe:
(With his face hidden, I can't tell whether he's lying or not. But...)

Ayerscarpe:
(He does seem genuinely sad.)

Mudrock:
——?

GreyThroat:
Don't move. Don't turn around. Put your hands up.

Click:
GreyThroat!

Mudrock:
When did you get here? You're pretty smooth...

Mudrock:
Whatever. Your bolts can't hurt me, Rhodes Island crossbowman.

GreyThroat:
I said don't move. I just want to ask you something.

Mudrock:
A conversation doesn't reveal your strength... what's the point?

GreyThroat:
Don't say I didn't warn you!

Mudrock:
Look. I've caught your bolt. You can't put a scratch on me.

Ayerscarpe:
He blocked her shot with a rock?!

Click:
N- no! It's Arts! He actually 'caught' the bolt! With mud!

GreyThroat:
Oh?

Mudrock:
No.

Mudrock:
At least you didn't shoot without warning. I hate sneak attacks. You're not so bad.

Mudrock:
And... Hm, if you wound up that second bolt... what would've happened?

GreyThroat:
That depends on whether or not you have time to protect your neck with your Arts.

Mudrock:
Hm... Even if I don't, I do have a very thick suit of armor...

Mudrock:
Doesn't matter. Since you have no intention of fighting to the death, I've had enough.

Mudrock:
Can I go?

GreyThroat:
Sorry, but no.

Mudrock:
...As expected. *Sigh*.

Mudrock:
So many Leithanians have joined us, and our ranks have grown bountiful and diverse...

Mudrock:
But... You, a crossbowman, you would not have missed this symbol. This is a symbol that once belonged to the Infected.

GreyThroat:
Reunion lit the fire that was, is, and will always be burning across all corners of Terra.

GreyThroat:
But, Reunion does not represent all Infected.

GreyThroat:
So, what about you? Are you from Leithanien yourself? Or are you an exile who wandered here, weighed down by sin and intrigue?

Mudrock:
Me...? Hm... I guess so. Our aimless journey began in Kazdel. And we've been on the run ever since.

GreyThroat:
Wolumonde is a mess. And I'm sure you had something to do with it.

Mudrock:
Right. There's no way we wouldn't.

Mudrock:
But I... am not Reunion either. Not anymore. I'm just the captain of Mudrock Squad. A... mercenary? No, let's say I'm just an Infected.

Click:
(Why does it seems like he's always talking to himself? What kind of Reunion guy thinks like that?)

Ayerscarpe:
(Please be quiet while the team leader negotiates. If you really have nothing better to do, you can record it.)

Click:
(Oh yeah! Fire up the camera...)

Mudrock:
But, really... What am I? I'm not a mercenary. I'm not Reunion. As things are now, I'm...

Mudrock:
Oh.

GreyThroat:
What?

Mudrock:
My Arts dirtied the flowers... They're so hard to find, this time of year.

Mudrock:
If you want to fight, can we do it somewhere else?

GreyThroat:
You have a way with words... But no.

GreyThroat:
Click, Ayerscarpe, keep your guard up. But don't attack him. Stay clear.

Click:
Phew...

Ayerscarpe:
Roger.

Mudrock:
Thanks.

GreyThroat:
One of our operators seems to have gotten caught up in this fire. I need answers.

Mudrock:
My condolences, but... We also lost four of ours to the fire.

Mudrock:
We're not so good with crime scene investigation or anything like that... But there are a lot of Leithanians with us.

Mudrock:
They've all been educated, and they have a natural talent for Arts unlike people from other countries.

Mudrock:
At least... I am sure someone did this. And it was no accident.

GreyThroat:
Who?

Mudrock:
If we knew, he'd already be dead and the town would be at peace.

GreyThroat:
Then tell me what you do know. Like, what was that Winterwisp you just mentioned?

Mudrock:
I think you misunderstood. I am not your enemy. I'm only here to pay respects to my people.

Mudrock:
But maybe someday we will fight each other. I have no reason to... trust you, or share information with you.

GreyThroat:
So that's it then. But it doesn't matter. I've gleaned a lot from your attitude alone.

Mudrock:
By the way, have you been to the town?

GreyThroat:
Yes.

Mudrock:
What did you think of it?

GreyThroat:
It's a mess. The Infected have risen up in protest, and they're fighting with the non-infected.

GreyThroat:
Your people whipped them into a frenzy.

Mudrock:
That's not good. So many innocent people hurt... But...

Mudrock:
But until Wolumonde admits its guilt, and until they hand over the murderer, there can't be peace.

Mudrock:
How could I convince them to stop, when they're outraged by the deaths of their people...?

GreyThroat:
It sounds like things have spun out of your ability to control them.

Mudrock:
Yes... More and more people keep getting sucked into it. Sooner or later, so will we...

Mudrock:
We are not in a position to move around so easily, but you are.

Mudrock:
Oh... I've said enough. I still can't completely trust you, Rhodes Island.

Mudrock:
Right. Still not enough trust. So that's it... goodbye.

GreyThroat:
......

Click:
GreyThroat! That guy's really scary! Even scarier than all those big Felines back at Rhodes Island!

GreyThroat:
At least he wasn't being very aggressive. But if he does have a whole squad with him... Wolumonde is in no condition to fight them.

Ayerscarpe:
So we let him go?

GreyThroat:
A direct attack is out of the question, and agitating them will only make Wolumonde's situation worse. Not to mention, we still don't know where Atro is.

Ayerscarpe:
If this does have something to do with Reunion, things will be much more difficult.

Ayerscarpe:
Have we made contact with Operators Folinic and Suzuran?

GreyThroat:
No. The town is so chaotic I was reluctant to even visit the town hall as an official representative of Rhodes Island.

GreyThroat:
But I found something very concerning. This doesn't seem to be a typical Infected conflict.

Ayerscarpe:
True. Leithanien has always been rather gentle in its treatment of the Infected. Something very unusual must have happened to push things this far.

GreyThroat:
That 'Winterwisp' is an important clue. We might have to investigate it further. Ayerscarpe, you come with me. Click, I'd like you to scout out their camp.

GreyThroat:
We need to get a handle on the size of their team, and their modus operandi. Just a quick look. Carefully.

Click:
Roger!

Ayerscarpe:
*Sigh*. If I'd known it would turn out like this, I would have stayed in the dormitory to watch Leonhardt play with rocks...

Mmm——♪ Mmmhmm——♪

Winterwisp, oh, Winterwisp♪

Townsfolk:
Winterwisp? Where did you hear that word?

Townsfolk:
Who are you? Rhodes Island? Outlanders shouldn't be meddling. This has nothing to do with you.

Townsfolk:
I don't know of any 'Winterwisp.' Leave me alone.

Townsfolk:
Winterwisp? No, there are no Winterwisps in Wolumonde. Haven't been for a long time.

Folinic:
A long time?

Townsfolk:
No, I mean... Oh, I shouldn't be talking to you.

Townsfolk:
Listen, I don't care what it is you're doing. But Wolumonde is a tighter community than you can imagine.

Townsfolk:
Most folks won't even tell you this rule, but I'll make an exception and explain it to you.

Townsfolk:
The 'Winterwisps' are part of Wolumonde's history. But they're a pretty controversial topic.

Folinic:
Seems to me there's a big controversy over the 'Winterwisps' right now.

Townsfolk:
You mean the power plant getting destroyed the other day? There's worse than that...

Folinic:
Worse than leaving Wolumonde stranded in this wasteland in the dead of winter?

Folinic:
Wolumonde was hard-hit by the Catastrophe, and enduring the winter will be much more difficult.

Townsfolk:
Don't get ahead of yourself, outsider. This issue is absolutely taboo. The noble lords come down hard. And I don't want any trouble.

Townsfolk:
If you really want to know about the Winterwisps, go ask them yourselves.

Suzuran:
Huh... How can we find a Winterwisp if we don't know what it is? That doesn't make any sense...

Townsfolk:
Enough!

Townsfolk:
Figure it out yourselves. I don't know anything.

Folinic:
Hey...

Suzuran:
He's gone. Can you believe that guy?!

Folinic:
A tight community? It is really tight-knit.

Suzuran:
Maybe we should go ask Mr. Severin...?

Folinic:
Well, we did make a major breakthrough. I just hope he doesn't dodge the subject like he did last time.

Folinic:
But the sun is already going down...

Folinic:
Hmph.

Folinic:
Blyat! How is it another day goes by and we're still none the wiser?!

Suzuran:
Please calm down, Miss Folinic...

Folinic:
I'm calm! I just... I...

Folinic:
There's something wrong here... I know it... But Atro... She... What the hell am I going to do...?

Folinic:
What can I do? Mama...

Mmm——♪ Mmmhmm——♪

Such a brittle little branch~♪

Winterwisp, oh, Winterwisp♪

Weary of a long life, weary of a long death~♪

Sing out your song, firm and strong~♪

Singing through summer~♪

And on through winter~♪

Winterwisp, oh, Winterwisp♪
