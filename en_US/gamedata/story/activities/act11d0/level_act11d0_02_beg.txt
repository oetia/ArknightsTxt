Nomadic Town Wolumonde, Infected Quarter, Zwölftontechnik Strasse

Suzuran:
Folinic... Are you angry?

Folinic:
The way they were acting, I know what it means. I know it all too well...

Folinic:
But... But Atro wouldn't get herself into trouble. She knows Leithanien better than any of us!

Suzuran:
Yeah! I'm sure she's fine!

Suzuran:
At least, I hope...

Townsfolk:
......

Townsfolk:
......

Suzuran:
Isn't this place eerily quiet?

Folinic:
Yes. Stay close.

Folinic:
I'm seeing plenty of Infected among the citizenry, but that's not the main point.

Folinic:
I was thinking about it when we fought those rioters before. This residential district is pretty ordinary in design, isn't it?

Folinic:
They've just gathered up all the Infected to live together. There's nothing explicitly discriminatory about it.

Suzuran:
Hm...

Folinic:
But the truth is they're still having their personal freedom restricted. And aside from a few remarkable Infected, most people live more or less like prisoners.

Folinic:
What they have is not a prison, but an entire street of cells with a dozen times more inmates.

Folinic:
Look here, how long do you think it's been since this bakery was open?

Suzuran:
Ew... I think I saw an Originium slug crawling around... so unsanitary.

Folinic:
No one's been sweeping up the dust and leaves around the door. There's no functioning economy here. No daily life.

Folinic:
I understand they've fallen on hard times, but no one wants to buy or sell bread? There's no public transit? This isn't normal.

Suzuran:
Maybe, maybe it's because of what happened before? Like the shop owner got scared off or something?

Folinic:
At least they have the right to live, they—

Suzuran:
Shh! Miss Folinic...! Lower your voice!

Townsfolk:
......

Folinic:
I wasn't criticizing them. I was just talking about... those 'armed Infected.'

Suzuran:
Do you think they're...

Folinic:
That policeman mentioned 'Sarkaz.' We need to look into that first.

Folinic:
If they do have anything to do with the 'armed Infected groups' we know, we'll have to tread carefully. Things here may be far more complicated than that policeman knows.

Suzuran:
Really?

Folinic:
If the Infected are living well enough, it's only because the situation isn't desperate enough.

Folinic:
They must be hiding something from us.

Suzuran:
Folinic?

Suzuran:
Please don't worry. Atro is very smart.

Folinic:
I...

Suzuran:
You've been looking very scary since that meeting. But don't worry.

Suzuran:
As long as we try really, really hard, we'll be able to handle this, just like the senior operators!

Suzuran:
So can you relax for me? At least a bit?

Folinic:
Aw, is little Lisa comforting me again? Why's that?

Suzuran:
Hehe, let go of all your troubles, big and small!

Tatjana:
Doctors, please wait a moment—!

Folinic:
It's you.

Folinic:
Didn't I say we don't need any help? All we need is access...

Tatjana:
I'm sorry. I know you said as much, Miss Folinic, but considering the circumstances, and your unfamiliarity with this place, we have to take precautions to guard against potential accidents.

Suzuran:
...Miss Folinic?

Folinic:
Fine... The locals may be more welcoming if we have one of their own with us.

Tatjana:
That's true! *Cough cough*! Zwölftontechnik Strasse was once Wolumonde's biggest Infected quarter...

Folinic:
And now, for certain reasons, it's become Wolumonde's number one protest district.

Tatjana:
Then what do you plan to do now?

Tatjana:
I don't think it's wise to go any deeper into this place... But if you want to learn more about the situation in Wolumonde, that is a good choice.

Folinic:
Let's just go for a stroll here. No need to rush things.

Folinic:
I'd be very happy if you were willing to tell me more about Dr. Atro.

Tatjana:
You... really worry about Dr. Atro, don't you?

Folinic:
We went to school together. And she is one of my very few trusted friends. Not to mention an employee Rhodes Island can't afford to lose.

Tatjana:
...I see.

Tatjana:
Ah, please come this way. Schaukelplatz is just up ahead.

Folinic:
What was Atro doing here?

Tatjana:
Um... Treating the local Infected, giving psychological counseling to those who were suffering.

Tatjana:
Wolumonde was unable to avoid the Great Rift because of an error the Catastrophe Messengers made, and we suffered immensely for it.

Tatjana:
Dr. Atro could have left, but she decided to stay. After Wolumonde moored here, she set up a temporary medical facility to better serve the Infected.

Tatjana:
Dr. Atro... is their hero.

Folinic:
...She was just doing what she had to do.

Folinic:
She's always been better at practical work than rote learning.

Tatjana:
......

Folinic:
Heh. I can see her face right now, looking so self-satisfied. That's Atro.

Tatjana:
This is the first time you've smiled since coming to Wolumonde.

Folinic:
Is it?

Suzuran:
You've been pretty scary all day long, Folinic.

Folinic:
Oh...

Suzuran:
There's... a lot of people up ahead. Is that where everyone is?

Folinic:
Shouldn't you do something?

Tatjana:
Peaceful assembly isn't a crime. That alone isn't grounds to detain them.

Tatjana:
They're looking this way...

Townsfolk:
......

Townsfolk:
......

Suzuran:
Why is everyone quiet all of a sudden?

Folinic:
No, this isn't right... Who's that talking to them?

Tatjana:
Huh?

Folinic:
Behind them, in the very back, there's—

Folinic:
A Sarkaz...?

Tatjana:
Sarkaz...?

Suzuran:
Miss Folinic!

Folinic:
I know! They're coming at us! Hey, you, protect yourself!

Tatjana:
O-okay!
