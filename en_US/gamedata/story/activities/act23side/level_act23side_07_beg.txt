One, two, three.

The hammer swings.

For over seven thousand days and nights, he swung the hammer just like this.

How he wished the hammer was not falling on an unformed iron billet, but on the blades and heads of his enemies.

Just like right now!

Shanhaizhong Boss:
The rest of you, retreat.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Your hammer is heavy, but not fast enough.

Meng Tieyi:
As long as it's heavy enough to break your blade and smash your head in!

Shanhaizhong Boss:
......

Meng Tieyi:
Oh, no. I planned a much better death for you. I wanted to stuff this warehouse full of explosives, and when the Catastrophe arrived, to give your lives as an offering to Yumen!

Meng Tieyi:
Of course, mine would be in there too.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
So that was your plan?

Meng Tieyi:
Why would I have taken the initiative to seek your cooperation otherwise?!

Shanhaizhong Boss:
I don't see why we should have such enmity between us.

Meng Tieyi:
Maybe it was how you somehow managed to sneak into Yumen, somehow disguised yourselves as martial artists to gain the trust of the guards, and then somehow caused chaos all over the city, turning Yumen into what it is right now!

Meng Tieyi:
My memory's not that bad yet!

Shanhaizhong Boss:
......

Meng Tieyi:
The day you first showed up in the city, I recognized you right away.

Meng Tieyi:
I've waited twenty years for you to come!

Meng Tieyi:
Such a pity that with just a little accident, everything was lost...

Meng Tieyi:
Lucky I still have this hammer of mine!

The warehouse is dimly lit, and the glass blade in Lin Yühsia's hand turns more and more transparent.

The Shanhaizhong seem fearful of her exquisite Originium Arts, and instead of swarming her, they coordinate and slowly begin to encircle her.

Lin Yühsia:
(For such a group to hide in the city for so long and stay undiscovered...)

Lin Yühsia:
(Their fighting style doesn't seem to come from any common school or military, and yet they're fierce and unrelenting, but also disciplined and highly organized... where exactly did they come from?)

Lin Yühsia:
(If only I had Ch'en's sword here to better deal with them...)

Lin Yühsia:
(What am I daydreaming for...? My top priority is to break out of here and bring the data with me.)

Du Yaoye:
Hey, let me help!

Lin Yühsia:
......

Lin Yühsia:
What are you still doing here?

Du Yaoye:
I got the Qis out and heard a fight over this way. Sure enough, it was this bunch again.

Lin Yühsia:
Your friends...

Du Yaoye:
They're fine.

Du Yaoye:
The Messenger and the escorts are all fine—Meng Tieyi had them locked up, but didn't harm a single one of them.

Lin Yühsia:
......

Du Yaoye:
Don't look at me like that, you haven't been forgiven yet. After we clean up these guys, I'll settle the score with you.

Lin Yühsia:
Then it's best you start thinking how to survive this, they won't be easy to deal with.

Du Yaoye:
You don't need to remind me.

Meng Tieyi:
Yaoye?

Du Yaoye:
You're not allowed to call me that!

Meng Tieyi:
......

Meng Tieyi:
Sounds like you know.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Distracted?

Meng Tieyi:
Shut up.

Du Yaoye:
Why should I shut—

Meng Tieyi:
I wasn't talking to you.

Meng Tieyi:
Anyway, I'm glad you're alright.

Meng Tieyi:
I will make my apologies after defeating my foe with my own hands.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Heh.

Du Yaoye:
......

Du Yaoye:
Why do you sound so relieved, speaking to me?

Du Yaoye:
Because no one actually lost their lives, because everything is still in your hands?

Du Yaoye:
If you had always planned a fake death for the Messenger team, why did you ask me to put the Qis on the job?

Du Yaoye:
Everyone in the city holds you in the highest regard, and you play games with their lives!

Meng Tieyi:
To be honest, it's not like I've never wavered...

Meng Tieyi:
But when you showed up at my door so enthusiastically, saying you wanted to open the first modern logistics company in Yumen and told me not to consider your father, Zheng Qingyue's reputation...

Meng Tieyi:
Oh, how I miss the times when we were young!

The force of each blade on him increases, as does the ferocity of the girl screaming at him.

Meng Tieyi stops talking, grits his teeth, and swings his hammer.

Du Yaoye:
I remember you telling me that you were a well-known figure in Yumen for all the right and wrong reasons.

Du Yaoye:
In your day, you trained with the Grandmaster to kill your enemies, and quick to exact revenge. In order to exact justice for the people who were robbed, you chased the bandits for more than a hundred li out in the desert and destroyed their stronghold.

Du Yaoye:
You know exactly how many streets, shops, and tents there are in the city. You know every part of Yan that your sworn-brothers in the army hail from.

Du Yaoye:
But right now, do you even care about Yumen anymore?!

Du Yaoye:
You're way more pedantic and muddled than my father who refuses to let go of his old ways!

Du Yaoye:
Times change, and so will we!

Du Yaoye:
Escorts will turn into logistics companies, and the Sword Forge will turn into a regular workshop. No one can stop this, and you shouldn't even try.

Du Yaoye:
No matter how much you hate, how much resentment you hold in your heart, you have no right to test Yumen with a Catastrophe just to see if it can hold a candle to its old days!

Du Yaoye:
How dare you?!

Du Yaoye:
Are you even worthy of this city?!

Du Yaoye:
Meng! Are you even worthy of yourself?!

Meng Tieyi:
......

Lin Yühsia:
Du Yaoye, watch out!

Meng Tieyi:
Huh?

Meng Tieyi has never once looked back.

A duel between masters does not tolerate even the slightest distraction, let alone an enigmatic like this woman.

He isn't sure if he fully comprehends exactly what little Du Yaoye has been scolding him over, only that it is loud and muddled with a lot of emotion.

But he hears Lin Yühsia's warning loud and clear, and turns his head on reflex.

Meng Tieyi throws the hammer in his hand, knocking away the enemies enclosing onto Du Yaoye's back.

At the same time, a long and narrow blade cuts his spine open.

Du Yaoye:
Uncle Meng—!

Meng Tieyi:
Xingyu Logistics... is a good idea...

Meng Tieyi:
But I, won't get to see the seeds sprout myself...

Du Yaoye:
......

Have you never considered... the jianghu you speak of is still here, just in a different form?

Shanhaizhong Boss:
The rest of you are next.

The woman steps over the body lying on the ground.

Blood drips down the extremely long blade.

Lin Yühsia:
She's coming.

Du Yaoye:
I can see that.

Lin Yühsia:
Since escorting the Messengers was a trap, that means Xingyu Logistics has yet to really open.

Du Yaoye:
......

Lin Yühsia:
I'm not sure if you be willing to accept my request to deliver something?

Du Yaoye:
Right now?

Lin Yühsia:
This box holds the true Catastrophe data that must be handed over to the Lord Exorcist. Take my token with you, and he will let you in.

Du Yaoye:
And then what?

Lin Yühsia:
Then you start hoping that it's not too late.

Du Yaoye:
Don't give me that, you'll have me run off while you stay and play the hero?

Lin Yühsia:
You should know very well, I'm not that good of a person.

Lin Yühsia:
But someone has to get the data out.

Lin Yühsia:
This woman is so unfathomably powerful, she even killed Meng Tieyi.

Du Yaoye:
......

Lin Yühsia:
With my Arts, I might be able to hold them back and create a quick opening for you.

Du Yaoye:
What about you?

Lin Yühsia:
Who knows.

Du Yaoye:
What are you talking about?!

Lin Yühsia:
If you think you can hold them back for me, then we'll switch roles.

Du Yaoye:
......

Lin Yühsia:
I'm sorry, for lying to you about your friends.

Du Yaoye:
You're not the only one who has lied to me. When I was yelling at Meng Tieyi earlier, that was all for you, too.

Lin Yühsia:
Right, I forgot to tell you this. Honestly, I think it is impressive for someone to travel so far and work so hard to make her living.

Du Yaoye:
Now's not the time for—

Lin Yühsia:
Remember this. If you don't make it out, Yumen won't make it through the Catastrophe either.

Du Yaoye:
This is a tall order, but Xingyu Logistics accepts.

Lin Yühsia:
Close your eyes.

Lin Yühsia shakes her hands, and the glass shards fall to the ground, instantly turning to quicksand.

Streams of fine sand flow from the corners and ceiling, quickly converging as one.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Still feel like putting up a—

The sand rises.

In the cramped warehouse, a sandstorm forms.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
Did something catch fire over there?

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
Could it be arson? Let's go take a look.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
The sand sluice?

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
Who would even come here?

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
True.

The military whistle sounds from the top of the city. The sky is already pitch black, and the outline of the full moons can be vaguely seen through the clouds.

If the old smith has finished his work and returns to the Sword Forge to find her missing, he could probably figure out that he should look for her over at the sand sluice.

The nomadic city foundations chew through the ground, the high-speed turbines grinding up oversized obstacles along with tons of sand and gravel, spitting them out with a deafening sound.

The old smith was right, there are no guards posted here, because no one would ever want to leave the city this way.

Jieyun:
(It's almost time...)

Fierce Animal:
(Violent braying)

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Three times you've gotten away from me. And lucky enough, you've once again walked yourself into a dead end.

Jieyun:
I don't know you.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
The sword on your back has nothing to do with our plans, but an object hiding one-twelfth of the bestial Sui's consciousness is of great interest to someone.

Jieyun:
Bestial Sui? What are you talking about...?

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Sounds like you don't know anything. That makes you even less worthy of holding that sword.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Hand it over.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
A black halo behind your head... an Anasa?

Jieyun:
So what if I am...?

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
An Anasa actively mingling in a Yanese nomadic city? How ridiculous.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Have you forgotten where you came from? Forgotten what happened to your people? While you were suffering out in the wilderness, aimlessly looking for food and shelter, did Yan ever help you?

Shanhaizhong Member:
Anasa, you should join the Shanhaizhong organization.

Jieyun:
All I see is the terrible things you've done in the city.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Then you're a fool.

Lin Yühsia:
(The sand will soon disperse.)

Lin Yühsia:
(There's no way I could match the woman Chief Wei and Dad couldn't beat together.)

Lin Yühsia:
(But I can at least delay her for a while longer, to buy Du Yaoye a little more time to make her way out...)

Shanhaizhong Boss:
You're scared of me, but you gave another the opportunity to escape.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
It seems that after all these years, you people have not changed a bit. Consider it an honor to die a brave death.

Lin Yühsia:
Gallantry isn't exactly my style, and I'm not about to let you kill me.

A crunch sounds, and within the next second the yellow sand condenses into a glass blade.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Trying a sneak attack?

Shanhaizhong Boss:
You lot really enjoy your cheap tricks.

To try and sneak an attack while ignoring the disparity in strength is just asking to die.

In the end, so many 'means' were employed to force Meng Tieyi out, and obtain the Catastrophe data.

I guess I could count this... as having done a good deed?

Oh well.

The glass sword crumbles inch by inch, the long blade already falling on her brow.

Swords clash, the sound rings through the air wrought by friction. Lin Yühsia's sword shifts its form between sand and glass, countless shards in the air reflecting a silhouette within.

The figure stands before her, tall and straight as a poplar.

Lin Yühsia:
......

Ch'en:
How did you know I would be here?

Lin Yühsia:
What are you talking about?

Ch'en:
I saw your Arts in the distance, I figured you were asking me to come save you.

Ch'en:
Just passing through.

Lin Yühsia:
Did you follow me here, like you did in Dossoles?

Ch'en:
Wasn't that <i>you</i> following <i>me?!</i>

Lin Yühsia:
You must've heard about the assassination attempt on Wei?

Ch'en:
......

Ch'en:
If you've got time to talk at me, you've got time to explain. What exactly is going on here?

The sand and dust have dissipated completely. Not a soul remains in the warehouse.

Lin Yühsia:
I <i>don't</i> have time, we have to get to the city gates!

Du Yaoye has been in the city for a while, but she never realized the streets went on for so long.

Just a hundred meters feels more difficult than traversing the mountain roads of Xunri Peak. The small box in her arms feels heavier than any quarry shouldered by the mountain pole-carriers.

Meng Tieyi:
Be it the Escort Association or a logistics company, things will always be the same. For the sake of our livelihood, we put our lives on the line. If you wish to make a name for yourself in this business, you need to understand how heavy the weight on your shoulders is.

I'll never forget all the stories about escort missions Dad would tell me, even if he kept repeating them over and over again. Or maybe because he did.

The principle is the same every time, but you only really understand it after experiencing it for yourself.

Du Yaoye:
(Faster, faster...)

Du Yaoye:
(I can see the gates!)

Du Yaoye:
They've almost caught up to me?!

Du Yaoye is skilled in the art of using the wind to anticipate danger. If she focuses without distraction, she could absolutely dodge this arrow.

The arrow pierces her right shoulder, causing the box to slip out of her grasp. She hastily reaches out with her left hand to catch it, but ends up falling to the ground, along with the box.

Vicious Shanhaizhong Member:
Silence her and retrieve the object.

Waai Fu:
Miss Du!

Du Yaoye:
It's you...

Waai Fu:
I was chasing another group of bad guys and ended up here.

Waai Fu:
Last night, when I hurried over to the Sword Forge, I saw the mandarins taking you away with them... What's going on here...?

Du Yaoye:
Don't wanna talk about it...

Du Yaoye:
Help me out, let's take care of these guys first.

Waai Fu:
Good plan.

Vicious Shanhaizhong Member:
Loose your arrows.

???:
Impudence.

A stretch of silk, a patch of snow, or perhaps the gleaming of a sword.

The arrows fall to the ground, neatly sliced in two.

Du Yaoye:
You're... the one who saved Zuo Le last night...

Du Yaoye:
Help me. I have something very important to deliver to the Lord Exorcist.

Qiubai:
......

Qiubai:
He's at the outer city tower, and you're seriously wounded. Can you still run?

Du Yaoye:
Save the goods, then the men.

Qiubai:
Very well, then leave them to us.

Du Yaoye:
Right, that Envoy Lin of yours is still holed up in the warehouse fighting some evil woman...

Du Yaoye:
Go help her.

Waai Fu:
Yühsia!

Qiubai:
Right. You get moving.

Vicious Shanhaizhong Member:
......

Qiubai:
Again with public acts of violence. You Shanhaizhong have gone too far.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
......

Vicious Shanhaizhong Member:
Master.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Where's the girl?

Vicious Shanhaizhong Member:
I almost got her, but these two stopped me.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Useless.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Hurry after her and get the data.

Qiubai:
You shall not pass.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
You think you can stop me? Let's see if you can dodge my blade another time.

Waai Fu:
So she's the evil lady Du was talking about?

Waai Fu:
If she's here, then that means Yühsia is...

???:
I'm fine.

Lin Yühsia:
Finally caught up.

Waai Fu:
Yühsia... is that... Superintendent Ch'en?!

Ch'en:
......

Lin Yühsia:
That's her alright. Where's Du Yaoye?

Waai Fu:
She's already on the move.

Lin Yühsia:
Good. Then there's only one thing left to do here.

Lin Yühsia:
Stop that woman.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
......

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Boring.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
It seems that after all these years, you people have not changed a bit. You don't know how to respect power.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
A colony of ants, is still just ants.

The wind blows away the clouds, and moonlight shines on the long and empty street.

The road is clean, save for a few yellow leaves swirling around the stone bricks.

It's the kind of cleanliness that comes after the decline of prosperity.

Like a bleak autumn night.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
It all ends here.

Autumn night...?

Waai Fu:
So she's behind all the chaos that's been plaguing the city?

Qiubai:
It's time to put an end to her troublemaking.

Qiubai:
Be careful. Her Arts are extremely strange.

Lin Yühsia:
Even my father and Chief Wei working together couldn't capture her. She's got a lot of tricks up her sleeve.

Ch'en:
You're telling me that this woman, talking all that trash, is the one who tried to assassinate Wei Yenwu?

Lin Yühsia:
You scared?

Ch'en:
You've got to be kidding me.

Ch'en:
Sounds perfect. We'll knock her out right here and I'll get to shove it in Wei Yenwu's face.

Lin Yühsia:
Alright.

Lin Yühsia:
Let's settle this here and now.
