Innkeeper:
Who was that man? He just came in, looked around, and left.

Inn Assistant:
Could be a plainclothes from the Patrol Battalion, coming to see if there are smugglers here?

Innkeeper:
Plainclothes won't bumble like that or draw so much attention.

Inn Assistant:
Then he came to cause trouble. I'll go and catch him.

Innkeeper:
How? He was gone in the blink of an eye. He clearly knows qinggong.

Burly Man:
That was the last inn. Nothing.

Burly Man:
The girl said she wanted to leave the city, but she's not at the gates.

Burly Man:
The doc had to use the best meds to treat her. What if she doesn't come back, and he puts the bill on my tab?

Burly Man:
I have to catch her.

Lin Yühsia:
I'm not sure I understand your analogy.

Lee:
Ah, it wasn't the most apt.

Lee:
I opened my little agency in Lungmen to make a living, but business ended up better than I expected.

Lee:
Wei Yenwu and the L.G.D. can't deal with every little trouble out there.

Lee:
We need good citizens like Mr. Lin to pitch in.

Lin Yühsia:
It can't be helped.

Lee:
Can't be helped... that's true for Lungmen, and it's true for Yumen as well.

Lee:
Yumen patrols the northern borders to repel potential threats to Yan.

Lee:
Back when Originium technology was not so advanced, it took several times the manpower to run a mobile fortress like Yumen, compared to today.

Lee:
A group of patriotic martial artists went to Yumen at the time. They never officially joined the army, but they helped out with all sorts of things.

Lee:
Escorting Messengers, scouting the path ahead, even going into battle with the army... they played a key role in Yumen's peace and prosperity, and earned the respect of the city.

Lin Yühsia:
The court and jianghu were of one mind.

Lee:
This was how Yumen used to be... until twenty years ago.

Lin Yühsia:
The Shanhaizhong?

Lee:
Yes. Once again, the Shanhaizhong were the reason.

Meng Tieyi:
There's nothing else.

Meng Tieyi:
I hope I didn't bother you in your duties. It would be on my head.

Zuo Xuanliao:
......

Zuo Xuanliao:
You knew I wouldn't agree.

A short whistle, then the tower's Originium lighting shuts off without warning, surrounding the pair in darkness.

A flickering flame lights up in the distance a second later.

The soldiers run back and forth, passing the torch between the beacons.

Seventeen roars of the drum, dragged through the night sky by the rapidly moving Yumen.

Meng Tieyi:
Today is the second day of the Wangfeng Festival.

Meng Tieyi:
It was created to remind the people of Yumen to remember the past.

Meng Tieyi:
This meeting may have taken place earlier, or later.

Meng Tieyi:
By then, you may have recalled a few things.

Zuo Xuanliao:
I've never forgotten.

Meng Tieyi:
Do you remember how many of the heroes who died for Yumen were not soldiers?

Meng Tieyi:
They owe Yumen nothing.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Nor does Yumen owe anyone anything.

Meng Tieyi:
Zuo!

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
......

Zuo Xuanliao:
Stand down.

Meng Tieyi:
It was my negligence that allowed those criminals into the city twenty years ago, disguised as Yumen martial artists. You can blame me, punish me, execute me!

Meng Tieyi:
But the blame should fall only on me—or on you!

Zuo Xuanliao:
All the responsibility falls upon me.

Meng Tieyi:
And how have you taken responsibility? Alienating the brothers who gave blood and sweat for Yumen, driving them away—is that your idea of taking responsibility?

Zuo Xuanliao:
......

Meng Tieyi:
Yumen owes them an answer!

Zuo Xuanliao:
Yumen belongs to Yan. All it does is in the service of the Yanese people. That's my answer.

Zuo Xuanliao:
This meeting is over.

Lee:
The name 'Shanhaizhong' is not widely known.

Lee:
It wasn't that anyone was negligent. Everyone was so focused on guarding against external threats, they didn't realize there were enemies hiding in the shadows.

Lee:
Bodyguards, bouncers, blacksmiths... these civilians often fought alongside the soldiers, and enjoyed a great deal of freedom in Yumen. The Shanhaizhong took advantage of this fact.

Lee:
The city was caught off-guard and responded slowly. The Shanhaizhong's plot to destroy the city's power core was foiled, but only after heavy casualties had been taken.

Lee:
After that...

Lin Yühsia:
Taking measures after the fact is still better than not at all.

Lee:
But the measures might have gone too far.

Lee:
After that, the Lord Exorcist began to reform the city's administration, removing jianghu involvement, and setting increased restrictions on the movement of people.

Lee:
Some of those who stayed joined the army. Others put their swords down and took up another living. An ordinary cook at an inn may have been a famous swordsman, back in the day.

Lee:
Twenty years is plenty of time for a city to look very different.

Lin Yühsia:
Dad always says that there will come a day when Lungmen won't need downtown or the Rat King anymore.

Lin Yühsia:
If there comes a day when this city no longer needs to patrol the barrenlands, then the people in the city won't need to carry swords anymore.

Lee:
Times change. Some want to give it a push, others a pull. In the end, they're all left behind.

Lee:
That's the story that I heard. Does it help?

Lin Yühsia:
A lot, actually.

Lin Yühsia:
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

Meng Tieyi:
What did you learn?

Yumen Martial Artist:
Ten-man, two-hour shifts. No extra guards at the sand sluice.

Meng Tieyi:
Just as I saw.

Meng Tieyi:
One more thing to ask you to do.

Meng Tieyi:
At the Hour of Yu, I want you to cause a little commotion around the sand sluice.

Meng Tieyi:
Nothing too big, just draw away the patrols.

Yumen Martial Artist:
What do you...?

Meng Tieyi:
Ask no questions, if you still trust me.

Yumen Martial Artist:
...Alright.

Yumen Martial Artist:
Did you see Zuo Xuanliao on the tower?

Meng Tieyi:
Yes, I did.

Qiubai:
It's getting hotter...

Qiubai:
Someone attacked Wei Yenwu last night and threw the Yumen barracks into chaos. You were the assassin.

Qiubai:
You cause abnormal weather wherever you go. Is this Arts? Or some other trick?

Shanhaizhong Boss:
......

Zuo Le:
Murder of a Messenger, attempted theft of Catastrophe data, attempted assassination of a court official.

Zuo Le:
What do you think Yumen is, Shanhaizhong?!

Shanhaizhong Boss:
A city headed the wrong way.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
This way is wrong. Go no further.

Zuo Le:
You know why Yumen is returning...

Shanhaizhong Boss:
It's not hard to guess.

Zuo Le:
Father tasked me to complete three tasks in three days: recover the Grandmaster's sword, catch the assassin, and track down the Shanhaizhong who have infiltrated the city.

Zuo Le:
It turns out all the answers were right here in the Sword Forge.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
You won't complete any of them.

Qiubai:
Stand back. This one's kung fu is unfathomable. We're no match for him.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
You're not as strong as the Forte man, but you seem a little quicker on the uptake.

Qiubai:
So it was you who attacked Lord Taihe.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
You dodged the last strike. Will you dodge or block the next one?

Qiubai:
......

Neither.

He often told her that kung fu is like climbing a mountain, whether as a tool of revenge, or a way of life. The more treacherous the path, the steadier one's heart must be.

She saw her enemy, and she saw the mountain. That is why she spent five years with him.

If the battle cannot be won, she would seek to not lose.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Offense is the best defense?

Shanhaizhong Boss:
You have guts, I'll give you that...

Shanhaizhong Boss:
But things are not as simple as you think.

Qiubai:
––

They cross swords, and she realizes her decision was imprudent.

She is facing another mountain.

Cold steel flashes before her face, the droplets on the blade touching her nose. She can hear her own heartbeat.

If the Record Keeper was here, he would have exclaimed that Qiubai recreated the move on the training ground.

Dive, stop, and turn around before hitting the arc of death, like the fowlbeast that narrowly avoids the waves on the river.

Qiubai:
(Groans)

Shanhaizhong Boss:
You dodged again.

Zuo Le:
How dare you!

Shanhaizhong Boss:
You?

Qiubai:
Get out of the way, Zuo Le!

Qiubai grabs Zuo Le by the collar and pulls him back.

He sees the foe's third swing, which lights up the yard.

It is March, but the Sword Forge feels like it is mid-summer. Even the night sky looks a little whiter in the heat wave.

There is only a pagoda tree behind them. There is nowhere to run.

Jieyun:
......

Jieyun:
The sword.

Du Yaoye:
Don't move!

Du Yaoye:
You're still trying to take the sword? Do you want to get yourself killed?

Du Yaoye:
You're not dying until you tell me where Meng Tieyi is, guawazi!

A burly man suddenly appears in the yard.

He grabs the girl and knocks away the sword in one fluid motion.

Like a bucket of cold water poured down on the ground, he forces everyone to scatter.

The heat disappears.

Burly Man:
I've been looking for you.

Jieyun:
Let me go!

Burly Man:
You almost got yourself killed.

Burly Man:
I told you to stay put in the clinic. Now you've made your injuries worse.

Jieyun:
......

Qiubai:
You're still in Yumen, Huai?

Huai:
Oh, it's you.

Huai:
Your shifu won't fight me until he's left his post. I have to wait for him.

Qiubai:
You haven't budged for three years?

Huai:
Nope.

Huai:
What's more important than this? Where can I find an opponent like him after he leaves Yumen?

Qiubai:
There's a kung fu master right here in front of you. Why don't you have a go at her if it's a fight you're looking for?

Huai:
This woman?

Shanhaizhong Boss:
You're in my way.

Huai:
Something didn't feel right when I blocked that attack.

Huai:
It was heavy, but had neither form nor design. I don't know what that strange power is, but you're no master.

Huai:
I have no time for you.

Wanderer:
You hear that commotion inside, Jing?

Wanderer:
That young man just broke in before I could stop him.

Jing:
Damn.

Jing:
This is Tieyi's last workshop. He's been good to us. We need to protect it.

Alert Shanhaizhong Member:
Master, Boss, there are more jianghu adventurers coming.

Alert Shanhaizhong Member:
And Yumen soldiers behind them, coming from three directions, around a hundred in total.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
......

Shanhaizhong Boss:
No point wasting time here if the one we're looking for isn't here.

Sudden silence. It is as though the cicadas were never there.

It is still March. The chill of early spring makes everyone shiver.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Let's go!

Zuo Le:
Stop right there!

Zuo Le:
......

Wanderer:
That's the one, Jing!

Jing:
Where are you going, sir?

Zuo Le:
Out of my way!

Jing:
Look at the mess here. Hardly anything left standing except the walls. You owe us an explanation.

Zuo Le:
This is a Yumen military case. Anyone who interferes will be arrested.

Jing:
Wait... you're Zuo Xuanliao's kid.

Jing:
So Zuo Xuanliao wants to take down the last Sword Forge now?

Zuo Le:
Impudence!

Millenion:
Lord Zuo.

Zuo Le:
Did you see the Shanhaizhong on your way here?

Millenion:
We've sent men after them.

Zuo Le:
Good. Round them up and take them into custody.

Millenion:
Lord Zuo, there are dozens of them... all local residents...

Zuo Le:
They appeared right as the criminals retreated and obstructed our pursuit. They must be investigated thoroughly.

Zuo Le:
All the rest have something to do with the case.

Du Yaoye:
The girl in the exotic outfit was hiding in the Sword Forge. She must know where Meng Tieyi is. I'm going with you, if you take her away.

Zuo Le:
The Sword Forge is linked to the Shanhaizhong. Given your ties to Meng Tieyi, I would have asked you to come with us regardless.

Du Yaoye:
......

Zuo Le:
As for you...

Jieyun:
......

Huai:
She's coming with me to get her wounds treated, and pay her bill.

Zuo Le:
This is no time for jokes.

Jieyun:
I-I can't go with you...

Huai:
Hmph, all you care about is the sword.

Jieyun:
Why you—!

Zuo Le:
—!

Zuo Le:
Take these people back to the barracks for questioning. I'll go after the Grandmaster's sword.

Millenion:
Are you alright, Miss Qiu?

Qiubai:
Just a scratch. Do as Zuo Le says for now.

Qiubai:
Please treat these jianghu people with proper respect, Millenion.

Waai Fu:
That man...

Noises continue to emanate from the direction of the Sword Forge, but Waai Fu stops in her tracks.

The figure on the roof vanished in the blink of an eye, as though it was just a gust of wind.

Waai Fu tightens her fist.

She has never been more certain.
