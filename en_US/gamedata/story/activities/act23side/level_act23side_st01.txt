Lungmen Tourist:
Hey, lou sai, what gives? This show skipped from episode seventeen to episode twenty!

Innkeeper:
Happens with a scratched disc. Must've been the sand. Just deal with it, it's not that bad.

Lungmen Tourist:
It was a key moment! Qi Qingqiu and Shen Feibai were at each other's throats a moment before, then suddenly they're fighting side-by-side? How'd we get there?

Drinking Old Man:
Qi Qingqiu finds out Shen Feibai killed his shifu, and sets out to kill him in turn.

Drinking Old Man:
When he arrives at Yumen, however, he finds Shen Feibai a high-ranking officer in the military.

Drinking Old Man:
With invaders at the gates, Qi Qingqiu suffers a sleepless night and realizes that there is more at stake than personal vengeance, so he joins the Grandmaster's banner to face the foe.

Drinking Old Man:
It's a simple story, but the duel by the cliffs was a classic!

Lungmen Tourist:
Wodetian, how many times did you watch that?!

Innkeeper:
Any child in town could recite the plot of Heroes of Yumen. Backwards.

Innkeeper:
There's just one detail that this gentleman left out. Qi Qingqiu didn't set his grudge aside when he first saw Shen Feibai in the army.

Innkeeper:
It was the Grandmaster who pledged to face Qi Qingqiu's sword on behalf of Shen Feibai, leading to the duel by the cliffs.

Innkeeper:
Clouds darkened the skies and the winds bellowed, as though heaven and earth were witness to the showdown. The two drew their swords—

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
(In awkward Yanese) Nonsense! Nonsense!

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
Fight look good, but details no, no good!

Innkeeper:
You again, He Xi'an. Do you even know enough Yanese to understand the story?

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
Of course! Heroes of Yumen tell true story fifty year ago. Many hero join together, even though disagreement, still fight together against enemy under Grandmaster.

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
I know many scenes shoot in these inn!

Innkeeper:
'Were shot', 'this inn'.

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
......

Lungmen Tourist:
Looks like you know a thing or two about Yanese history.

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
Of course. Grandmaster tell me when teach me fighting, in Sargon.

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
Grandmaster has sword, but sword special, cannot pull out.

Innkeeper:
This again. How could you lose to that Feline girl so easily if you're really the Grandmaster's pupil?

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
What about Feline girl? She very strong. Why you look down her?

Lungmen Tourist:
He's not looking down on her. He's looking down on...

Crowd:
Hahaha...

Lungmen Tourist:
So if the TV show was adapted from a true story, was there really a time in Yumen when kung fu adventurers joined forces with the army against a common foe?

Lungmen Tourist:
To enjoy the freedom of being one's own master, but also achieve great things fighting for one's country... it's pretty cool.

Drinking Old Man:
Well, it's a TV show. The only people who know how things really went down historically are the ones who were there.

Drinking Old Man:
Anyway, swords and spears are out of fashion. If you really want to do something for your country, you should learn Arts and become a Tianshi.

Drinking Old Man:
How would a fortress like Yumen operate, without civilians working to supply its resources?

Drinking Old Man:
The people who came here to this cold and remote place when the city was first built, and the people who still stay here—they're fighting for their country, in their own way.

Drinking Old Man:
The only thing in the TV show that we know is real for sure, the Grandmaster, is leaving too.

???:
Out of the way.

Burly Man:
The medicine you ordered.

Innkeeper:
Thanks. Just put it over there; I'll have someone take it to the back.

Burly Man:
I've got the creams for bruising and burns, but we didn't have enough supplies to make herbal meals.

Innkeeper:
Here's the money. Send my regards to the doc. Oh, and we just had our supplies delivered. Take some back to the clinic.

Innkeeper:
There's a lot of stuff. One second, I'll get someone to help.

Burly Man:
No need.

Innkeeper:
He carried the whole cart on his shoulders?!

Innkeeper:
How did the clinic find someone so strong?

Innkeeper:
Good morning, sir.

Lee:
I've been here a few days, but I've never seen this place empty.

Innkeeper:
We just linked up to resupply with Lungmen a few days ago, only to run into a Catastrophe that forced an emergency separation.

Innkeeper:
Lots of merchants and tourists were stranded in Yumen, filling up the inns.

Innkeeper:
Business is good, but it also means more trouble, especially when people who are already frustrated start arguing.

Lee:
There are many who would love to have your problem.

Lee:
Although come to think of it, my head would probably start to hurt if my little business back in Lungmen started getting so busy.

Innkeeper:
Would you care to start the day with some tea?

Lee:
Sure. What about the thing I asked you to look into?

Innkeeper:
Here, the Yumen Arena Board of Fame records from the past six months. Not much I can do if the martial artist you're looking for isn't on it.

Lee:
So Yumen operates an arena to this day... such a martial tradition is impressive.

Innkeeper:
The Lord Exorcist trains his troops well, and there's no need for folks like us to fight on the battlefield these days. Still, the martial artists need somewhere to hone their kung fu, hence the arena.

Innkeeper:
Anyway, I would suggest you stay a few days, if it's not urgent. With so many people passing through, someone may have seen the one you're looking for.

Innkeeper:
You could also ask at the South Side Sword Forge.

Innkeeper:
The shifu there knows the city inside and out. Plus, lots of kung fu fighters hanging around.

Lee:
Thank you... it's always tough when you don't know the lay of the land.

Innkeeper:
Mind if I ask what this is about? Are you looking for a friend? An enemy? A debt to repay? Or a debt to collect?

Lee:
I guess you could say this particular individual owes me a pretty big debt...

Lee:
How long will you be this time?

Huai Tianpei:
No idea.

Lee:
Will you ever come back?

Huai Tianpei:
When it's all done.

Lee:
Do you know that Waai Fu's birthday is in three days?

Huai Tianpei:
I wasn't a good husband, and I can't be a good father.

Huai Tianpei:
It's enough that I achieve one thing in life.

Innkeeper:
A debt to collect, eh? That's gonna be tough. Yan is a big country, and more than a hundred thousand souls live in Yumen alone. Not easy to find someone who doesn't want to be found.

Lee:
......

Innkeeper:
Anyway, your tea's ready. Would you like a side of Yumen-style sauteed meat to go with it?

Lee:
Sure, I'll take a seat and wait for my girl to finish her match.

Innkeeper:
Lungmen Spring Tea. Just came in. We only get fresh leaves like these once every few years.

Lee:
Appreciate it. Feels like a waste to use them on me.

Innkeeper:
Don't say that. We always value our guests.

Lee:
......

Lee:
Hm... Spring Tea from Lungmen shouldn't have a bitter taste this time of the year...

Aloof Woman:
...It's you?

Aloof Woman:
We weren't supposed to meet here.

Lee:
Er... excuse me?

Aloof Woman:
No... you're not...

Innkeeper:
Do you two know each other? Would you care to share a table, since we're pretty full today?

Aloof Woman:
No, we don't. I'm not staying long, just a cup of tea.

Lee:
It's fine, it's fine.

Innkeeper:
Very well, then. Let me know if you need anything.

Lee:
Did you mistake me for someone else?

Aloof Woman:
You just looked familiar.

Lee:
Must have been an old friend that you haven't seen for ages.

Aloof Woman:
I suppose... stick to your tea.

Lee:
Have one on me.

Aloof Woman:
You're buying me a cup of tea, even though we don't know each other?

Lee:
All meetings are the work of fate, even the ones that start with a misunderstanding.

Lee:
Here's to finding old friends soon.

Aloof Woman:
It'll happen when it happens. No point trying to force it.

Lee:
That's an interesting answer. The answer lies not in the ones we're looking for, but in the journey of looking for them.

Aloof Woman:
Do you talk so much to everyone?

Lee:
Ah, I apologize...

Lee:
Are you leaving?

Aloof Woman:
I said I wasn't going to stay long.

Lee:
How strange...

Taihe:
Are you sure you don't want to speak to the general first? It's been a while since the last time you came back.

Zuo Le:
Father is a busy man. I should not bother him at work.

Taihe:
Perhaps I'm being too much of a busybody, but the Department of Discipline and Supervision found your actions faultless in the Shangshu matter. You should not feel guilty about facing the general.

Zuo Le:
I don't.

Zuo Le:
There's nothing for me to do at home anyway. I thought I might as well take a look around town. The Grand Tutor must have sent me to Yumen expecting something to happen. I should keep my eyes open.

Taihe:
I'll come with you, if it's official business.

Zuo Le:
It's been years since the last time you were here, hasn't it, Uncle Taihe? It must bring back memories.

Taihe:
Things have changed a lot.

Taihe:
It's impressive that the general has been able to keep the people of Yumen safe and thriving, with constant warfare going on in the north.

Zuo Le:
The arena remains as popular as ever.

Zuo Le:
You still rank fifth on the Board of Fame.

Taihe:
Fame is fleeting. I would be glad to see some young talent knock me off the board.

Taihe:
The girls in the ring right now...

Taihe:
......

Zuo Le:
Did something catch your attention?

Taihe:
I was just thinking how your kung fu would compare to theirs.

Zuo Le:
Ahem...

Zuo Le:
The Grand Tutor says that a Candleholder's duty is to carry the fire that drives out the shadows of the Feranmut, and to travel amongst to people to learn their troubles.

Zuo Le:
A sense of duty comes first, shrewdness second. Kung fu comes third or fourth at best.

Taihe:
Indeed.

Zuo Le:
......

Zuo Le:
So... How <i>do</i> I compare, then?

Taihe:
To be frank, while few are as swift as you, in a head-to-head fight, I would say your chances are thirty-seventy, in the other side's favor.

The pair have already traded a dozen moves.

There is hardly time to catch one's breath.

The Feline girl advances, launching a flurry of fists that keeps her opponent's weapon hand in check.

She kicks out. Her opponent, a girl in exotic garb, goes along with it, leaping back with the kick.

Waai Fu:
Hold!

Waai Fu:
You're out of the ring.

Waai Fu:
It's true that you couldn't make full use of your ranged weapons in the ring.

Waai Fu:
But rules are rules. It's my win.

Exotically Dressed Girl:
......

Waai Fu:
You're very good. And I've never seen anything like your style of fighting.

Exotically Dressed Girl:
(In awkward Yanese) Lose this, no more fights?

Waai Fu:
A martial artist shouldn't be too obsessed with victory and defeat, but I can't lose here.

Exotically Dressed Girl:
You want the sword too?

Waai Fu:
Sword? What sword?

Exotically Dressed Girl:
People in the city say, number one on the Board of Fame can get the special sword.

Waai Fu:
No... I just wanted to climb the rankings so my name can be seen.

Exotically Dressed Girl:
You number 31. Means 30 people stronger than you?

Waai Fu:
...I suppose so.

Exotically Dressed Girl:
You are better than me.

Exotically Dressed Girl:
(I guess this won't work...)

Waai Fu:
Hey, where are you going?

Waai Fu:
If I win this, I make it to the first page of the Board of Fame.

Waai Fu:
But will he see it?

Record Keeper:
Round 15. The Millenion was hit in the right wrist, right pectoral, central abdomen and throat. Qiubai was not hit. Qiubai is the winner.

Millenion:
Haha, I would have died three times, if this were a real battle.

Qiubai:
Real battles are about the mind as much as kung fu. Who knows how things would have turned out?

Millenion:
You are indeed the Grandmaster's student. It was humbling.

Qiubai:
...Thank you.

Qiubai:
I would like to see the Grandmaster's comments.

Record Keeper:
The recent ones are all here. The Grandmaster has been paying close attention to your bouts, despite his busy schedule, and he has high praise in particular for your swordsmanship.

Qiubai:
......

Record Keeper:
Something on your mind?

Qiubai:
I was just thinking what he meant by 'not enough purity in the sword.'

Qiubai:
And how long would it take for me to reach the point where I can beat him.

Record Keeper:
There is no mention of it in the Grandmaster's Book of Kung Fu. I don't think he said it to anyone but you.

Record Keeper:
As for beating the Grandmaster... I'm not sure how many in the entire world have even dreamt of such a thing.

Qiubai:
You think I'm crazy?

Record Keeper:
My job is simply to follow the Grandmaster and record the martial arts of the world truthfully.

Qiubai:
There are many more people than usual at the training grounds today. Why isn't he here?

Record Keeper:
General Zuo has visitors. The Grandmaster is also meeting an old acquaintance in the keep.

Qiubai:
I'll be going, then.

Record Keeper:
Man zou. It was an honor.

Qiubai:
......

Qiubai:
Why do you always treat me like I'm your senior, even though you've been following the Grandmaster for much longer?

Record Keeper:
The Grandmaster says that one who keeps records must be acutely aware of the strengths of others.

Record Keeper:
You are stronger and wiser than I am. I have much to learn from you.

Qiubai:
If you say so.

Stern Man:
......

The general nocks an arrow, drawing the thick bow so full that it looks like the full moon.

The hand on the bow trembles slightly, and the arrow wobbles with it. The general's brow furrows deeper with each wobble.

The arrow pierces the target, half an inch away from the bullseye.

Liang Xun:
Good shot, sir.

Zuo Xuanliao:
No need to flatter. I know my own body.

Zuo Xuanliao:
I could still swing the sword and spear a couple of years ago, but now I can hardly hold a bow properly.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Even if there's no need for me to stand on the battlefield myself, it's not proper to have a sick man leading the Yumen garrison... my time is short.

Liang Xun:
All the court knows that your injuries bear witness to decades of service in defense of Yumen.

Zuo Xuanliao:
I'm not concerned about my health or life, but I have some unfinished business.

Liang Xun:
The Grand Tutor has instructed me to assist you. I will help you manage Yumen's return.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Did the Grand Tutor say 'assist?'

Liang Xun:
I'm sure you understand his intentions...

Zuo Xuanliao:
I haven't thanked you for your help in Shangshu yet. I apologize for the trouble that Zuo Le caused. He's still young and inexperienced.

Liang Xun:
You exaggerate, sir.

Zuo Xuanliao:
You must understand what a father feels.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Zuo Le has done well, but he is in a position that does not permit any mistake, no matter how small.

Liang Xun:
Lord Zuo is young and bright, a rising star. It's not unusual for young people to be a little impetuous. I would not worry too much about it.

Zuo Xuanliao:
What about me, Liang? Am I impetuous to you?

Liang Xun:
...I believe you have your reasons, sir.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Word of your benevolent administration in Shangshu has reached even Yumen, Liang, but have you ever seen a battle with your own eyes?

Liang Xun:
There were pirates on the Shangshu River a few years ago... but nothing compared to the battles that you have seen.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Then you understand that making decisions as a general in the field is different from managing at a desk.

Zuo Xuanliao:
The battlefield is ever-changing, and thousands of lives hinge on your every decision.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Which do you think is more important then: decisiveness, or caution?

Zuo Xuanliao:
The bestial Sui matter is pressing. We must act.

Liang Xun:
I am much illuminated.

Zuo Xuanliao:
In your position as Yumen Advisor, you are on the battlefield, and we are comrades. I hope you understand my way.

Liang Xun:
I trust you, sir. I'll give my all.

Liang Xun:
However, the Feranmut problem is neither administrative nor military.

Liang Xun:
I trust your decisiveness, but I also ask that you trust my caution.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Right...

Another arrow, this one striking the bullseye square.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Would you care to try, Liang?

Zuo Xuanliao:
Your reputation is that of a scholar-warrior, equally at home with sword and bow as with pen and paper.

Zuo Xuanliao:
The Yumen bow is heavy, though. Do you feel up to it?

Liang Xun:
......

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
Chief Executive Wei Yenwu of Lungmen is here, sir. He's waiting in the meeting hall.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Very well.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Mr. Lin's daughter was a few days early. It was about time for Lord Wei to arrive.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
The Grand Tutor has arrived as well.

Zuo Xuanliao:
......

Zuo Xuanliao:
Did the Grand Tutor and Lord Wei travel together?

Liang Xun:
I expect Lord Wei is here on private matters.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Official or private, there are still two honored guests at the same table.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Looks like you're not the only one here to give me counsel today, Liang.

Ling:
My dear elder brother.

Chongyue:
I had a dream last night.

Chongyue:
I dreamed I heard the wind rushing by at midnight. I opened the window to find the desert had become a sea of sprouting trees, some of them even in full bloom.

Chongyue:
The branches of the trees grew and formed a web, trapping Yumen within.

Ling:
'Few are those who truly break away from home.'

Ling:
Do you still miss Yumen?

Chongyue:
What was the saying you had when you left Yumen last time? I forgot.

Ling:
'Neath crisp night merriment resounds; travelers doubt 'its truly frontier-bound.'

Chongyue:
A new one. It's been a while; looks like your thoughts have changed.

Ling:
A century is not too long, but I came back at this point in the dream.

Chongyue:
To me, a hundred years is simply thirty thousand days and nights, the urgent reports, the scouts departing, the Messengers returning.

Chongyue:
The watch has changed innumerable times since you left, and countless new bricks and stones set into this wall.

Chongyue:
But still it stands.

Chongyue:
Did you see Nian and Dusk in Shangshu?

Ling:
Yea. They haven't changed one bit. They've found a place to stay, a place where they can have fun.

Chongyue:
And so, you met our second brother.

Ling:
We lesser siblings always worry our eldest brother, don't we?

Chongyue:
Dusk is a sensitive and thoughtful little sister, but she keeps it to herself and tells no one, which is why she's often troubled.

Chongyue:
Nian looks carefree on the surface, but she fears loneliness more than any of us. She constantly needs something new to keep her mind occupied.

Chongyue:
I don't have much to worry about you, other than maybe you getting too drunk and forgetting to pay your tab.

Chongyue:
But as the oldest sister, and without any official responsibilities, it would be good if you spent more time with your younger siblings.

Ling:
Do you accuse me of being an irresponsible big sister?

Ling:
How many families are like ours? From whom do I learn? I have to figure things out on my own.

Ling:
But our foolish sisters just don't know how to rise above things. They keep making it hard for themselves.

Chongyue:
Don't blame them for being self-troubled. Put yourself in their shoes, and you may not find it easy to free yourself from troubles.

Ling:
I'm not as free as you are. After all, you've managed to completely cut your 'Self' off, and find an entirely new 'Self'.

Chongyue:
......

Chongyue:
The name 'Shuo' and the sliver of soul are sealed within the sword. Now I'm just an ordinary man who knows a little kung fu.

Ling:
'A little?' How many martial artists would abandon their careers if they heard you just now?

Chongyue:
Taking into account the fact that I've had centuries of practice, perhaps I should call myself less than ordinary.

Ling:
......

The sand sluice there churns through tons of sand every second, clearing a path for Yumen's advance.

The massive nomadic city rolls toward its new goal at high speed.

Ling:
Where are you planning to go after you leave Yumen?

Chongyue:
I'll go south to see the bridges and streams, have some of the heartland brew, or see the place where Nian and Dusk are staying.

Chongyue:
The jianghu world is big. There are plenty of places to go.

Chongyue:
But I suppose all the people with whom I've shared a toast are gone now.

In the distance, the heat rising from the ocean of sands warps heaven and earth.

The wind is weak by the time it reaches the tower. The sand in the wind touches the cheeks, almost like a caress.

Three thousand miles of yellow sand, in the blink of an eye.

Yumen Sentry A:
Checked the serial numbers on the gear. It's the Catastrophe Messenger's group, which should have been back this morning.

Yumen Sentry A:
Traces of Originium explosives. The bodies have probably crystalized and turned to dust...

Lin Yühsia:
Watch out for Originium residue.

Lin Yühsia:
This is less than two hours from the city. Who would attack a Catastrophe Messenger on official business so close to a nomadic city?

Yumen Sentry A:
Everything valuable has been taken. It would make sense if this was the work of bandits.

Lin Yühsia:
Or someone who wants to make it look like the work of bandits.

Lin Yühsia:
Keep looking. We need to find the Catastrophe survey data.

Yumen Sentry B:
Found it!

Yumen Sentry B:
It was a little further away, under a piece of broken armor.

Yumen Sentry B:
They protected it with their lives.

Lin Yühsia:
......

Lin Yühsia:
There's no time. Get it back to the city, but keep your eyes open.
