Injured Girl:
—!

???:
Stay down.

Injured Girl:
(Ancient Sarkaz language) Who are you? Why am I here?

Burly Man:
Can't understand a word. Not that it matters.

Burly Man:
You're here to heal your wounds. You'll do exactly as the doc says, if you want to see the sun rise again. If the don't want to die here, do as I say.

Injured Girl:
(In hesitant Yanese) Where am I... who are you?

Burly Man:
This is an infirmary and you're a patient. I'm a helper at the infirmary.

Injured Girl:
Where's my sword?!

The girl reaches around her in a panic, only calming down when she finds the weapon beside her.

Injured Girl:
It's there... thank goodness...

Burly Man:
We found you passed out at the door of the infirmary yesterday, but you wouldn't let the sword go. Did you get hurt fighting over it?

Injured Girl:
...Doesn't concern you.

Burly Man:
No need to look at me like that. I could've taken it while you were passed out, if I wanted to.

Burly Man:
I've seen so many people die over so-called masterwork weapons.

Burly Man:
Did you really think wielding a weapon like that would make you strong enough to beat enemies you couldn't?

Burly Man:
I don't trust weapons. The only thing I trust is my fists.

Burly Man:
A true warrior shouldn't entrust victory to something else.

Injured Girl:
You don't understand!

Injured Girl:
I'm not trying to fight with this sword... I... I want to repay a debt.

Burly Man:
The sword is a weapon for killing.

Injured Girl:
My mentor told me the sword means a lot to her.

Injured Girl:
I promised her that I would bring her the sword, or bring it to her grave at least.

Burly Man:
Has your mentor passed away?

Injured Girl:
Yes...

Burly Man:
Well, I'm not interested in listening to people talk about their debts and grudges.

Burly Man:
If you say you fought over the sword to repay a debt, I'll believe it. A woman who's almost died has no need to lie.

Burly Man:
So it means you see your obligations as being more important than your life. That's not a bad thing.

Injured Girl:
Why did you help me?

Burly Man:
What's an infirmary for, if not to help people?

Injured Girl:
But I don't have any money. I know that money is required in exchange for kindness in the nomadic cities.

Burly Man:
That's not wrong, but you can work your debt off as well. Why do you think I'm working here for the doc?

Burly Man:
The difference is that I'm working to pay the medical bills of the people I beat up.

Burly Man:
I do the heavy lifting at the clinic, so you should learn to do things like drying herbs and wrapping wounds. You don't owe as much as I do. A few months should be enough to pay your debt off.

Injured Girl:
No!

Injured Girl:
I will find a way to repay your kindness, but I am in a hurry...

Injured Girl:
I need to get out of the city.

Burly Man:
You're not going anywhere.

Burly Man:
I said, stay down. You're here to get your injuries healed.

Burly Man:
You managed to survive them. Would be a shame if you died now. Not to mention an embarrassment to the clinic.

Burly Man:
But... kindness is important too. I'll think about it... once you're healed up and repaid your debt.

Injured Girl:
......!

Burly Man:
Another patient?

Burly Man:
I'll take a look. STAY, DOWN.

Burly Man:
What is it?

Zuo Le:
Are you the doctor, sir?

Burly Man:
The doc's out. I'm a helper here. I can help you, if you just want meds, but you'll have to wait if you want the doc to look at you.

Zuo Le:
I apologize for the interruption. We are investigating a case and pursuing a suspect. Here is my token. We would appreciate your cooperation in answering a few questions.

Burly Man:
Ask what you want. I'll decide if I want to answer.

Zuo Le:
Has this clinic treated or seen anyone who suffered serious a stab wound?

Burly Man:
Nope and nope. Either you're buying, or you go find someone else to bother.

Zuo Le:
I would like to take a quick look. It'll only take a minute.

Burly Man:
Nope, patients and customers only.

Zuo Le:
I have nothing but the greatest respect for the clinic's work. I would rather not have to force my way in.

Zuo Le:
But this concerns the safety of all of Yumen. Your cooperation would be appreciated.

Burly Man:
You got your rules, I got mine. You ain't coming in unless I say so.

Zuo Le:
Then I apologize.

Zuo Le's movements are swift as a fowlbeast.

But he feels a hand on his collar just as he is about to cross the clinic's threshold, throwing him backwards.

The burly man continues to stand there, as though he has never moved.

It is as though the fowlbeast flew into an invisible and boundless net.

Zuo Le:
(This man is no ordinary brute!)

Burly Man:
I said, you ain't coming in! You got a death wish, kid?

Zuo Le:
......

Zuo Le:
Do you understand the consequences of obstructing justice?

Burly Man:
Don't understand, don't care.

Burly Man:
Try that again, I dare you.

Zuo Le:
Enough! This is not a game.

Burly Man:
Huh...?

Zuo Le:
There's someone else in there?!

Burly Man:
Hm? Hey, where did the girl go?

Zuo Le:
What the...?

Bandages and cotton balls are scattered on the table, and the bed is still warm.

The air smells of blood and herbal medicine.

Zuo Le:
You said no heavily wounded patients were taken in lately.

Zuo Le:
How do you explain the gauze and blood?

Burly Man:
Aiya! I told her to stay put!

Burly Man:
She said she needed to get out of the city. She must be headed to the gates!

Burly Man:
Oh no, I've gotta catch her, or the doc's gonna put her bill on my tab!

Zuo Le:
Stop right there!

Cheerful Shouting:
Tea leaves! Shangshu rock tea, Kou-wu flower tea, Jiangqi white tea, Dahuang raw leaves... anything you want, I've got it here!

Lin Yühsia:
Two carts of Lungmen green tea.

Hawker:
E-Excuse me, miss, but we don't sell tea by the cart...

Lin Yühsia:
We meet again.

Lin Yühsia:
Any updates on what I asked you to look into?

Lin Yühsia:
We agreed on terms.

Agitated Hawker:
I... I don't know what you mean...

Lin Yühsia:
How many caravans in this batch are carrying false permits? How did they get those permits?

Lin Yühsia:
I need to know more.

Agitated Hawker:
I-I'll pay the taxes I owe! The whole amount! Please, don't ask any more questions!

Lin Yühsia:
We can talk about your previous offenses another day.

Lin Yühsia:
Answer my question.

Agitated Hawker:
......

Agitated Hawker:
H-Help!

Agitated Hawker:
Thief!

Angry Passerby:
You've got nerve, stealing in broad daylight!

Helpful Passerby:
Grab her!

Lin Yühsia:
You test my patience.

Lungmen Agent:
Watch out! I saw an accomplice go that way!

Lee:
Excuse me...

Blacksmith:
The owner is out. You need something made?

Lee:
I just have a couple of questions.

Blacksmith:
This is a smithy. The inn's where you go for gossip.

Lee:
I hear there are some old jianghu kung fu stories that only circulate here.

Blacksmith:
Fine, I guess it can't hurt to have someone to chat with while I work. Fire away.

Lee:
I really ought to buy something for your trouble.

Blacksmith:
What d'ya want? Frying pan? Kitchen knife?

Lee:
How about a sword?

Blacksmith:
Sorry, can't do that. Household items only.

Lee:
But the sign on the door says 'Sword Forge'.

Lee:
This is probably the last place in Yumen that still uses that particular wording.

Blacksmith:
It's just a name. The owner could change it to 'The Tea Parlor' or 'The Guest House' if he wanted.

Lee:
Fair enough.

Blacksmith:
You're not from around here, are you? Tourist?

Lee:
I've wanted to see the deserts of Yumen for a long time.

Blacksmith:
We get a bunch of tourists every time we link up with Lungmen thanks to the wuxia TV shows. Anyone with half a brain should know that it's all fake.

Blacksmith:
What's so good about this backwater place?

Blacksmith:
Did you want a souvenir sword? Trust me, you're better off getting a pack or two of Yumen jerky.

Lee:
Every place has its own unique scenery. It's always worth a look.

Lee:
Setting aside whether the TV shows are fake or not, I'm sure there's a story behind this smithy.

Blacksmith:
Sure of that, are you?

Lee:
I don't mean to offend, but every shop I passed by on my way from the market was full of people... except this one.

Lee:
Why would a shop with no history or business be on a busy street like this?

Lee:
And I doubt a shop that really has no business would have so many furnaces burning and so many iron ingots lying around.

Blacksmith:
This is why I hate talking to smart people. Makes my head hurt.

Lee:
I'll take that as a compliment.

Blacksmith:
Alright, what do you want to know?

Lee:
I wanted to ask you about stories from the world of kung fu... but you've piqued my interest in something else.

Lee:
How did 'The Sword Forge' become a smithy?

A man running for his life can always find an extra burst of speed.

Just as he is about to shake his pursuer, a rope appears out of nowhere, tripping him over. He tries to pull himself back up, only to find nothing but quicksand around him.

Lin Yühsia:
Had enough yet?

Agitated Hawker:
(Gasps for air, exhausted)

Lin Yühsia:
Good. Now we can talk.

Lin Yühsia:
What are you afraid of?

Agitated Hawker:
This... this group is different...

Lin Yühsia:
I know.

Agitated Hawker:
T-They'll have my head if I talk...

Agitated Hawker:
I have a family... they're counting on me to feed them... please...

Agitated Hawker:
You—!

Agitated Hawker:
Miss Lin, I know how you and the Rat King operate...

Agitated Hawker:
Y-You wouldn't...

Lin Yühsia:
That's up to you.

Lin Yühsia:
Or do I really need to prove to you what I'm capable of?

Agitated Hawker:
I...

Lin Yühsia:
Tell me what you know.

Agitated Hawker:
The smugglers that make the rounds when Lungmen and Yumen link up are usually pretty consistent. The same groups, working with the same forgers, same suppliers, same fences.

Agitated Hawker:
This time around, though, there's a new group that nobody knows anything about, not even the oldest crooks. Some tried to pick a fight... and nobody ever saw them again.

Lin Yühsia:
The new smugglers disappeared?

Agitated Hawker:
No, the ones who picked the fight...

Lin Yühsia:
What else do you know?

Agitated Hawker:
......

Lin Yühsia:
Out with it.

Agitated Hawker:
I've heard, well, rumors about where they hide and sell their stuff...

Lin Yühsia:
You took care of things at the market?

Lungmen Agent:
Nothing a few coins couldn't fix.

Lin Yühsia:
Good.

Lungmen Agent:
And this man...?

Lin Yühsia:
Take him to the barracks, then back to the L.G.D. after we're done here in Yumen.

Agitated Hawker:
I-I told you everything I know! Why—

Lin Yühsia:
Quit complaining, it's for your own safety.

Zuo Le:
He just disappeared?

The markets of Yumen are not usually so busy.

The streets are packed with people, and parents hold their children's hands a little tighter.

It is not easy trying to find someone in this crowd.

???:
Are you buying or not?!

???:
Get out of the way if you're not buying! You're in everybody's way!

Zuo Le:
Sorry...

The noise of people shouting, arguing and bartering drowns out deadlier sounds.

Zuo Le:
What the—?!

The sword comes from behind, without a sound.

Zuo Le takes a step forward, almost by instinct.

The point of the sword tears through his clothes, inches from leaving behind a wound that would have crippled him for life.

Zuo Le:
Who's there?!

Zuo Le turns around, but sees only the bustling market.

Zuo Le:
(Did he intentionally draw me here?)

Zuo Le:
(A commotion here would...)

Zuo Le:
(Where are you?)

Zuo Le:
......!

Lee:
The market sure is busy today, isn't it?

Zuo Le:
Mr. Lee?

Lee:
Looks like we have some troublemakers in the crowd. Be careful.

Zuo Le:
I noticed. Did you...?

Lee:
Just a little optical trick. Won't last long.

Lee:
It's dangerous here. We should leave.

Zuo Le:
No choice, I suppose...

Shanhaizhong Member:
......

Lee:
Turns out we're the ones who fell into a trap.

Zuo Le:
Let's get out of here. We don't want civilians getting hurt.
