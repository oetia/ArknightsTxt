I saw two children fight over a fruit in that blurry mist.

They were about the same age and size, but one was quicker and punched heavier, and he knocked his foe to the ground.

He gets the fruit.

To the victor goes the spoils.

I saw that hunt.

Humanity declared war on Them. Mortals brought down gods that they could not even fathom, at the price of millions of lives.

Victory or death.

Record Keeper:
Round 8.

Record Keeper:
The Grandmaster takes one step back before his opponent's assault. Huai Tianpei's fists are exhausted by the time they reach the Grandmaster's palm.

Huai Tianpei:
(Flexes bones)

Huai Tianpei:
Huff...

Record Keeper:
Round 9...

Record Keeper:
Huai Tianpei strikes at the Grandmaster's flank, cutting off his retreat.

Record Keeper:
The Grandmaster stays still and strikes back with equal force, cutting off Huai Tianpei's attack.

Huai Tianpei:
(Coughs blood)

I lost.

I lost?

Record Keeper:
Round... 10.

The Record Keeper's ink brush stops.

He does not know how to record this.

It could not be simpler. Punch, hit, separate. No forms, no variations, just force against force, like two children fighting over food.

The only difference is that they are fighting over victory.

He has never seen Grandmaster wince in pain. Until now.

Wind.

Record Keeper:
...The Grandmaster has won.

Chongyue:
......

Huai Tianpei:
(Coughs blood)

Huai Tianpei:
Hahaha!

Huai Tianpei:
Hahahahaha!

Chongyue:
Looks like you weren't concerned with victory or defeat.

Huai Tianpei:
How could I not be?!

Huai Tianpei:
You're the First Under Heaven.

Huai Tianpei:
But all it took was forty years for me to get the upper hand on you, once. Another three hundred and sixty years, and I'll beat you and become First Under Heaven!

Chongyue:
True, you would likely surpass me, if you had another three hundred years.

Chongyue:
But how can a mortal live that long?

Record Keeper:
It's true that some people have lived three centuries, using Originium Arts to extend their lifespans.

Record Keeper:
I doubt that would be possible for Mr. Huai, however.

Chongyue:
You're the First Among Men. No need to wait three hundred years.

Record Keeper:
Grandmaster... Mr. Huai has fainted.

Chongyue:
......

Chongyue:
Take him back to the barracks. Treat his injuries.

Yumen Sentry:
(Cheering)

Yumen Sentry:
(Bangs on sheathes)

Grand Tutor:
Liang Xun, that man is your friend?

Liang Xun:
Yes.

Grand Tutor:
Do you think he can be entrusted with the sword?

Liang Xun:
In terms of skill and character, there is no other choice.

Grand Tutor:
Very well.

Grand Tutor:
What say you, Lord Exorcist?

Zuo Xuanliao:
......

Zuo Xuanliao says nothing. He gazes at the battlefield below. One lies on the ground, one is standing. The outcome has been decided.

But the soldiers continue to bang their swords on their sheathes, a tradition among Yumen soldiers when they watch a demonstration.

It was a rare sight, a life and death struggle on a great battlefield, under the raging winds and sand.

Even the sickly general feels his heart race.

How many times has he fought alongside him? Has he ever fought so hard against any other foe?

If there is one to whom he can entrust the sword, it should be...

Zuo Xuanliao:
The Catastrophe...

Zuo Xuanliao:
It's coming.

Jieyun:
I'm back, Shifu.

Jieyun limps towards a small mound by the nomadic city's route.

The grave is new, with a few poplars on each side that she planted to mark the place. Fortunately, it is close to where she thought it would be; the city has not traveled far.

She bows down and places the sword at the grave.

Jieyun:
I said I would bring the sword back. I did it.

Jieyun:
I went to the forge, saw the blacksmith, and the old pagoda tree.

Jieyun:
The city is very different from how I imagined.

Jieyun:
Is that a place that can be called 'home?'

Why are people not afraid to live on a great, moving plate?

They're not afraid that a Catastrophe would destroy their houses, not afraid that they won't have food or water.

Jieyun:
I don't understand.

Jieyun:
I don't understand the people in the city, or you, who left the city.

Jieyun:
I don't understand what kind of person he is.

......

The voice feels far away. Is someone speaking to her?

She suddenly wants to see what the sword is like.

Chongyue:
I'm leaving tomorrow.

Chongyue:
The borders have been peaceful lately. Things should be fine even if I'm away for a while.

Such a hurry?

Chongyue:
Your condition... and that of some of the others, they can't wait.

Chongyue:
Just because there's no doctor who can treat it doesn't mean there's no one in Yan. If there's no one in Yan, perhaps there's another in these vast lands...

Chongyue:
I have a brother who may be able to do it.

Chongyue:
Take care while I'm away.

You're not a doctor. Why don't you ask what the patient wants?

My days may be numbered, but I want to see other places with the ones I have left.

All I've seen in my years at Yumen is sand as far as the eye could see. I want to travel, while I can still ride a burdenbeast.

To see Shangshu's famous mountains, taste Jiangnan's famous fresh water chestnuts...

With someone, hopefully.

Chongyue:
You're sick. You need to stay put...

What do you know about being sick? You've never been sick or injured, have you?

Not only that, we've known each other for so long, but I've never seen a crease appear on your face.

We're not the same.

Chongyue:
......

Chongyue:
I'll be leaving. Don't think too much. Get some rest...

Jieyun:
Is this a dream?

Jieyun:
I...

The ancient sword leaves its sheath.

Its shape is somewhat unusual, but otherwise it is an ordinary sword, not even sharp.

Through the blade, she sees the clouds in the sky, and the shadow of the sun.

The sliver of the ghost leaves quietly.

He has found the answer.

Jieyun:
......

Jieyun:
I must go.

Jieyun:
I need to return the sword... and ask him face to face.

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
Why are you sleeping on the walls, Miss Ling?! A Catastrophe is coming. Get down and get to a shelter.

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
Leave this to us.

Ling:
What's the situation?

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
The Four Guardians have been deployed, as have the sand filters and Originium scrubbers. They are Yumen's first and firmest line of defense.

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
Given the size of the cloud formation, however, the Four Guardians will not be able to completely shut the storm out. Dust and Originium particles that get through will form a secondary storm.

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
The scale would be equivalent to a small Catastrophe.

Ling:
......

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
Following the evacuation, all the plates on the east side have been retracted to avoid impact, but the plates of the inner city are immobile and will be impacted by the secondary storm directly.

Ling:
How many are you?

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau has twelve casters stationed at Yumen.

Ling:
How are you deployed?

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
Six here, six in the inner city.

Ling:
Are six enough to protect the inner city?

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
The Lord Exorcist has deemed both locations critical.

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau will do its best.

Ling:
......

Ling:
Go to the inner city. Leave this place to me.

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
......

Ling:
The danger is the same. Go.

Ling:
Last time I saw a scene like this was decades ago, when I first came to Shangshu.

Ling:
Yumen doesn't have brews as refined as Husong and Guixing, but Liedaozi is good stuff. Heavens, look at the scene you're treating me to.

Ling:
A toast to you too, Heaven.

Ling:
Ack, there's no goblet for me to throw right now.

A crack of thunder, so close it makes everyone's heart skip a beat.

The dark clouds are above the city in an instant.

Thick masses of air pull the sky down, while the darting arc lightning looks almost alive.

Raindrops evaporate the moment they form. The air is so dry that the slightest contact could set something on fire.

Yumen serves as the flint.

A single sight as far as the eye could see. How overwhelming, how terrible, how magnificent!

Ling:
Come!

The lantern lights. The poet stands up, and drinks her fill from her flask.

The sandstorm and thunder rage, as earth and heaven become one stage.

Throw a goblet to the setting sun, toast the tower with sand overrun.

All of Heaven and earth, in the flask.

Patrol Battalion Soldier A:
Increasing output.

Patrol Battalion Soldier B:
......

Patrol Battalion Soldier B:
Keep it up! The dams must run at maximum power.

Patrol Battalion Soldier A:
The sand sluices have never been asked to churn so much sand, even with Yumen at full speed. With the city stationary right now, running the sluice dams at full power without the normal offloads would result in very high wear...

Patrol Battalion Soldier B:
No time to think about that!

Patrol Battalion Soldier B:
If all the sand and Originium dust that the Wind Aegis block piles up in front, it's going to swallow Yumen's foundation, jamming the whole city.

Patrol Battalion Soldier A:
......

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Maybe you should worry about yourself right now.

Patrol Battalion Soldier A:
What the?!

Jing:
The sky is unrecognizable.

Millenion:
Mr. Jing? Why are you here? Everyone should have evacuated to the west side.

Jing:
I came back.

Jing:
Those Shanhaizhong wangbadan are using the chaos to sabotage our Catastrophe defenses and harass the people. We caught them in the act a few times.

Millenion:
That's a job for the Patrol Battalion.

Jing:
Can the Patrol Battalion deal with the Catastrophe and the Shanhaizhong at the same time?

Jing:
Why do we carry swords, if all we do is hide at a time like this?

Millenion:
......

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
Hey, I help.

Jing:
You're a tourist. There's no need to...

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
Yan saying, repay drop of water with river.

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
You buy me many drink. I repay.

Jing:
I like your spirit. Alright, hop on.

Millenion:
But...

Jing:
What's most important to Zuo Xuanliao? Protecting Yumen.

Jing:
Catch.

Jing:
Freshly brewed Liedaozi! The old man said to give you guys a treat.

Millenion:
Mr. Meng was...

Jing:
No need for any of that.

Jing:
All we need to know is that he died at the hands of these wangbadan.

Greedy Shanhaizhong Member:
Pah, these Yumenites didn't forget to take all their valuables, even when they're fleeing for their lives.

Greedy Shanhaizhong Member:
But there are a few jewelry shops on this street. They can't very well have taken all of it...

Cold Shanhaizhong Member:
You just can't pass up a little looting, can you?

Cold Shanhaizhong Member:
The other team has gone to close the sand sluices. Don't forget the mission.

Greedy Shanhaizhong Member:
I would never.

Greedy Shanhaizhong Member:
But they're ready for us.

Cold Shanhaizhong Member:
A bunch of ruffians who haven't had a real fight in twenty years, satisfying themselves with fighting in the ring for show.

Cold Shanhaizhong Member:
Useless rabble.

Millenion:
Here they come.

Jing:
An impressive-sounding name won't change the fact that they're just a bunch of thieves and bandits.

Jing:
Useless rabble.

Millenion:
They're spreading out and trying to cause as much chaos as possible. Don't let them get away!

Millenion:
I need a group to cut off Kangqing Street! It leads to the west side where the civilians are!

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
I go!

Jing:
We'll have a drink and kill some bad guys.

Jieyun:
Why does the trip back feel so far...?

Jieyun:
The wind and sand are getting...

Zuo Le:
Found you... good thing your footprints weren't completely wiped away.

Zuo Le:
You weren't lying about planning to come back to Yumen.

Jieyun:
Why are you here?

Zuo Le:
To get the sword back.

Zuo Le:
And to make sure you're safe.

Jieyun:
Why are you hurt as well?

Zuo Le:
No time to talk about that. We need to get back to the city!

Jieyun:
......

Zuo Le:
You were lucky to survive the jump down the sand sluice. Your injuries will take a long time to heal, though.

Zuo Le:
Here, hold on to me.

Zuo Le:
––

Jieyun:
What is it?

Zuo Le:
I must be seeing things. There couldn't be anyone else out here at a time like this.

Zuo Le:
Let's go.

Shadow Guard:
......

Shadow Guard:
Yumen has come to a full stop, slightly off the expected location.

Shadow Guard:
The Catastrophe has reached the eastern side of Yumen. Unable to hail Lord Wei at this time.

Shadow Guard:
We're climbing.

Lin:
Just look at Miss Ling.

Lin:
The excitement is rubbing off on this rat.

Patrol Battalion Soldier A:
......

Patrol Battalion Soldier B:
They want to close the sand sluices.

Patrol Battalion Soldier B:
They know how important it is right now... do the Shanhaizhong have people with engineering expertise?

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
(Sneers)

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
You can jump now, or I can throw your corpses down after I kill you.

Qiubai:
......

Patrol Battalion Soldier A:
Miss Qiu?

Qiubai:
I heard Zuo Le came here, so I thought I would help out as well. Looks like I came at the right time.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
You?

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Shanhaizhong once sent an invitation to the river fort of Jiangqi, but we didn't get a response.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
How ironic that you've chosen to take the side of the Yanese army.

Qiubai:
You're well-informed.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Of course. We pay attention to those who walk our path.

Qiubai:
Cut the crap.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Have you forgotten that you came to Yumen for revenge?

Qiubai:
Good question. Unfortunately, I've already found the answer.

She raises her sword again.

This time, there is no need for her to pull back.

The man from Sargon swings at the Shanhaizhong member trying to attack the soldiers, forcing him back.

His Yanese is mediocre, but his attack is clean, powerful, pragmatic.

Jing:
Nice!

Jing:
So you weren't exaggerating back at the inn. You've got a couple of tricks up your sleeve.

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
No couple of trick, only one trick.

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
Grandmaster taught me when he came Sargon, but only one move...

Jing:
They're still not backing off, even after losing so many. Are they not afraid to die?

Tourist in Sargon Garb:
What happen?

Millenion:
It's the sound of the storm impacting the Wind Aegis. Be careful.

Millenion:
This is a bigger Catastrophe than any Yumen has encountered before.

Millenion:
I don't even want to think about the Imperial Astronomical Bureau Casters who are taking the full brunt of it.

Cold Shanhaizhong Member:
The Catastrophe is raging. They have their hands full dealing with it. Don't waste time here.

Cold Shanhaizhong Member:
Take these ones out and retreat to the evacuation shelters on the west side.

Greedy Shanhaizhong Member:
Gotcha.

Jing:
Where do you think you're going? We knew you were coming this way.

Jing:
Round them up!

Jing:
We'll leave the Catastrophe to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau Casters. These wangbadan are ours!

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
......

The sky has broken. Gravel and rock beyond reckoning clash, roll and rub against each other in the maelstrom, screeching like metal on metal.

The storm bears down on the tower, then hits a wall of Arts.

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
Hold your ground!

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
Form up!

Lin:
That's the secondary storm <i>after</i> it passes through the Wind Aegis?

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
Mr. Lin! What are you doing here?

Lin:
Lending a hand.

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
We can handle this. You should go back.

Lin:
To where? How am I supposed to get my afternoon nap when there's a commotion like this out here?

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
......

Lin:
The Originium scrubbers in the inner city can stop the particles from spreading, but the impact of the storm itself must be met with Originium Arts.

Lin:
One more warm body.

Lin steps forward.

He has already taken off his coat.

Lin:
I've manipulated sand for decades. I might as well find a coffin to sleep in now, if I can't make myself useful at a time like this.

Lin:
Or are my little tricks just a burden to the great Tianshis?

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
...Just be careful, sir.

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
Make way for Mr. Lin!

Lin:
That's right.

Lin Yühsia:
Dad! I've been looking for you...

Lin:
Perfect timing, Yühsia.

Lin Yühsia:
You're hurt!

Lin:
Will that get in the way of anything?

Lin:
Watch. You still have much to learn when it comes to Arts.

The storm converges again in mid-air and approaches once again. Dirt and rocks spin chaotically on the outer edge, while the air has been so compressed at the center that sparks are flying.

The heavens roar, then silence.

A wall of sand rises, filling every gap in the wall of Arts, pushing it slowly but steadily forward. One meter, three meters... ten meters.

Lin stands at the center of the casters, a great tree that budges for no storm.

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
I've never seen Arts like this before...

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
To achieve such stability over such a large area...

Lin:
It's coming again!

Lin Yühsia has never seen the full extent of her father's Arts. It has never been needed for his enemies.

The shadow of Lungmen leads a regular life.

Taking 'walks' through the streets, enjoying a bowl of finball soup, visiting people, living and dead.

Most of the time, he is smiling, nonchalant. There are few things that make him bare his fangs.

He looks much smaller without his coat. Yühsia can see his arms begin to tremble, like thin branches that could be broken by a stiff wind at any time.

Lin:
......

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
Help Mr. Lin down.

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
He has taken the brunt of four waves of Originium storms. He can take no more.

Lin:
(Coughs blood)

Lin Yühsia:
Dad!

*pant*...

*pant*...

'I just hope this will be resolved quickly without delaying your trip to Victoria.'

'It's not your own choice if you haven't seen another path.'

Those are the kind of things that Dad always said.

Lin Yühsia did not want her father to set her path. Perhaps she has not made a decision yet.

But Dad is already old. He was not joking when he talked about retiring.

When the old fall, it is time for the young to take their place.

The logic is illogical, yet immovable.

Yühsia steps forward and takes her father's place, shielding him behind her.

Lin:
......

Imperial Astronomical Bureau Caster:
Miss Lin...

Lin Yühsia:
Don't speak. You're all injured. Adjust your breathing.

Lin Yühsia:
Here it comes.

Lin Yühsia:
Keep your eyes forward!
