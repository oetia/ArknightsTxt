Mischievous Kid:
Ma, look, a fight!

Busy Woman:
Happens all the time, haggling turning into a fight. Nothing to see.

Busy Woman:
Stay close, I don't know how I'd find you if you got lost here.

Lee:
They won't give up so easily. Protecting ourselves is one thing, but it'll be hard to avoid harming civilians.

Zuo Le:
Do you have an idea?

Lee:
There's a way out, but you'll have a mess on your hands...

Zuo Le:
Wait––

Lee:
(Damn, too late—)

Shanhaizhong Member:
(Groans)

Such a response is more than just talent and training; it is the result of experience accumulated from countless deadly battles.

Qiubai:
Leave.

Shanhaizhong Member:
......

Qiubai:
Don't chase.

Qiubai:
There are too many people here. These villains have no qualms about harming innocents.

Zuo Le:
(Heavy panting)

Zuo Le:
Q-Qiubai... it's been a while...

Qiubai:
It's been a while, but you don't seem to have gotten any better.

Zuo Le:
......

Zuo Le:
Why have you come?

Qiubai:
The Grandmaster instructed me to help you.

Qiubai:
And who is this gentleman?

Zuo Le:
A friend I met on a previous mission... and an old acquaintance of Liang's.

Qiubai:
Someone without an official position shouldn't involve himself in this—even a friend of Liang's.

Lee:
Ah, well, I just happened to pass by.

Lee:
Anyway, someone always tells me not to meddle whenever I'm hired to do something. Guess it's a private eye trope.

Zuo Le:
My life would have been in danger if not for your help. But are you really here by chance?

Lee:
Would the Sui Regulator believe me if I said yes?

Zuo Le:
No jokes, please. This is important.

Lee:
I never look for trouble; trouble just has a tendency to find me.

Lee:
I'll leave it that my client is an acquaintance of Chief Wei of Lungmen. You may have already met him at the barracks last night.

Lee:
I guess the ones who attacked you just now were the people he hired me to find.

Zuo Le:
What else do you know about what happened in Yumen last night?

Lee:
Not much. The ones who hire private eyes aren't exactly the talkative type. You get used to it.

Lee:
Maybe I could help, if you told me more.

Zuo Le:
......

Zuo Le:
I stabbed the assassin in the scuffle last night, so I started my search in the clinics.

Zuo Le:
I searched every single clinic in the city and didn't find anything unusual, until the last one. A man called himself a helper and would not let me in.

Zuo Le:
I forced my way in and found gauze and blood. The man ran off with an agitated look on his face.

Lee:
Someone has the nerve to obstruct the Sui Regulator in Yumen?

Zuo Le:
I wasn't sure what to make of it. Obstruction of justice is a crime, but I couldn't make heads or tails of what the man was talking about. It didn't feel premeditated.

Lee:
Could you describe the man in more detail?

Zuo Le:
Let me think...

Zuo Le:
Feline, male. Looks to be in his forties... exceptionally skilled in kung fu.

Lee:
......

Lee:
Could it really be him?

Waai Fu:
We should hurry. Yühsia wants us to visit the deceased bodyguard's family.

Du Yaoye:
I'm coming, I'm coming. This is the last house anyway.

Waai Fu:
Say, I haven't had the chance to ask you... why did you come to Yumen?

Du Yaoye:
I told you, I set up my own logistics company.

Waai Fu:
Mr. Zheng told me his daughter came to Yumen too, but I didn't expect to actually meet you.

Du Yaoye:
That's how fate works, I guess.

Du Yaoye:
Say, since we've worked together on this case, wouldn't it be natural for you to join Xingyu Logistics afterwards?

Waai Fu:
You're still talking about this?

Waai Fu:
Anyway, it seems like Yühsia dragged a lot of people she knows into this.

Du Yaoye:
I didn't know she was the Rat King's daughter.

Waai Fu:
You know Mr. Lin too?

Du Yaoye:
Not really. Dad's heard of him on his travels.

Du Yaoye:
I thought you would know each other well, being fellow Lungmenites.

Waai Fu:
Lungmen isn't exactly one of those small towns where everybody knows everybody...

Waai Fu:
I see Mr. Lin from time to time in the course of my work, but I've only heard rumors about Yühsia.

Du Yaoye:
I'm curious... what do Lungmenites think of the Rat King?

Waai Fu:
The word 'Lungmenite' is way too broad.

Waai Fu:
Some think of him as a benevolent protector. Some want as little to do with him as possible. Others just see him as a kindly old man.

Waai Fu:
Only one thing is certain—he's the key to Lungmen's peace and security.

Du Yaoye:
Sounds like someone not to be trifled with... must be hard being Miss Lin.

Waai Fu:
Why do you say that?

Du Yaoye:
Fathers always want their children to walk the path they paved for them.

Du Yaoye:
Especially accomplished fathers.

Waai Fu:
Do you not get along with Mr. Zheng?

Du Yaoye:
I wouldn't say that... it's more like I prefer some distance between us.

Waai Fu:
Some fathers out there don't care about their children at all.

Waai Fu:
They do as they please, leaving their children for somebody else to care for. They disappear for a decade without a word.

Du Yaoye:
Do you mean...?

Waai Fu:
Never mind, I don't want to bring him up now.

Du Yaoye:
If the old man went missing for a decade, I would take over the association and rebuild it in my own image.

Du Yaoye:
I would show him that I can do better.

Waai Fu:
But what if he never comes back to see how well you've done?

Du Yaoye:
......

Du Yaoye:
This is the place.

Waai Fu:
Hello? Anybody home?

Waai Fu:
Excuse me. We're—

Waai Fu:
Hey, the door's unlocked. And there's nobody in the clinic.

Du Yaoye:
This is the fourth place.

Du Yaoye:
The guard who died was the son of the doctor here. The doctor's a local who's been running the clinic for decades. No other members in the household.

Du Yaoye:
News of the Messenger's death reached the city yesterday afternoon. The doctor should already know.

Waai Fu:
But the room is neat and tidy. Not a speck of dust on the furniture. The two bags in the corner look like items from today's market.

Waai Fu:
I don't know Yumen customs, but it's as though nothing happened whatsoever.

Waai Fu:
How would a father react to the news that his child is dead?

Du Yaoye:
......

Du Yaoye:
Certainly wouldn't act like nothing happened, at least.

Waai Fu:
But there's no one home. It's not right for us to barge in.

Waai Fu:
Let's rendezvous with Yühsia.

Lungmen Agent:
The warehouse that the smuggler talked about is just ahead.

Lungmen Agent:
Strange...

Lin Yühsia:
Do you know this place?

Lungmen Agent:
I checked out the various depots in the city when I visited last time. This warehouse was used by the South Side Sword Forge for storing metals and Originium fuel.

Lungmen Agent:
The Sword Forge is a reputable business operation. It shouldn't have anything to do with this.

Lungmen Agent:
Yau mou gaau coh?! He played us for fools!

Lin Yühsia:
Take it easy.

Lin Yühsia:
We're in no rush.

Lin Yühsia:
He doesn't have the nerve to lie in a situation like that. We're already here; all we need to do is take a look.

Lin Yühsia:
You keep watch. I'll check it out.

Lungmen Agent:
Be careful.

Lin Yühsia:
......

Warehouse Guard:
Lost your way, miss?

Lin Yühsia:
Isn't this the stonemason's warehouse?

Warehouse Guard:
......

Lin Yühsia:
I'm here to buy stone.

Lin Yühsia:
Your boss couldn't sculpt his way out of a shoebox, but the stone's not half-bad, so I thought I would buy a bunch.

Lin Yühsia:
He gave me permission to come to the warehouse. He says you'll show me around.

Warehouse Guard:
Zhong's Stonemason?

Lin Yühsia:
Think so. The shop at the east end of the market.

Warehouse Guard:
Zhong's Stonemason's warehouse is on the west side. This is the south side.

Warehouse Guard:
So you can stop right there.

Warehouse Guard:
Look around you. Nothing but iron and scrap metal, not a rock to be found.

Warehouse Guard:
I'm sure you're lost.

Lin Yühsia:
Damn, I even paid a guide to take me here! That fraud...

Warehouse Guard:
......

Lin Yühsia:
Sorry for the intrusion.

Warehouse Guard:
It's fine. Let me see you out.

The clouds part to let the bright sun shine through, stinging Lin Yühsia's skin slightly. She subconsciously reaches behind her neck, then looks up at the man.

What kind of attire would leave a sunburn on the neck like that?

Warehouse Guard:
What are you looking at?

Lin Yühsia:
Nothing. Goodbye.

Lungmen Agent:
How did it go?

Lin Yühsia:
Stay here and keep a close eye out for nearby movement.

Lungmen Agent:
Something didn't seem right?

Lin Yühsia:
Don't ask questions. Just keep your eyes peeled, and report anything unusual.

Lungmen Agent:
Roger.
