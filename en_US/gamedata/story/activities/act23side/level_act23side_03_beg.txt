Angry Martial Artist:
Let us out.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
We've been through this.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
The General has declared a high alert to ensure Yumen's safety. No one is allowed to leave the city without permission.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
Turn back.

Angry Martial Artist:
You dare speak of Yumen's safety to me?

Angry Martial Artist:
We were guarding Yumen long before you even picked up a stick, kiddo!

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
......

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
In times like these, I need you to think about the greater good.

Angry Martial Artist:
The greater good?

Angry Martial Artist:
Do you remember when a group of bandits infiltrated the city and injured innocent people in the process?

Angry Martial Artist:
It happened so suddenly, and the situation was so messy that you refused to lift a finger, so we had to take things into our own hands. We chased them hundreds of li and spent three whole days in the desert.

Angry Martial Artist:
We had to carry half our brothers back to the city, but we managed to drag the bandits along with us.

Angry Martial Artist:
Now our brothers lie dead out there, their bodies still rotting, and you're asking us to wait?

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
Master Jing, we all know your story, and we have infinite respect for you.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
But General Zuo has decreed that while we are hunting a serious criminal, no one is to leave the city without his permission.

Angry Martial Artist:
His awe-inspiring authority has me quaking!

Angry Martial Artist:
Tell that Zuo Xuanliao to come out here and face us!

???:
Impudence!

Angry Martial Artist:
Master Meng...

Meng Tieyi:
I heard you shouting from across the city. These men are only following orders. Why do you have to be so hard on them?

Angry Martial Artist:
We just, can't let them talk to us like this...

Meng Tieyi:
You're venerable elders of our city.

Meng Tieyi:
You've fought many battles to defend Yumen, even Messengers through Catastrophes. Our stability is thanks to your hard work.

Meng Tieyi:
Even though the Lord Exorcist and Grandmaster are still present, you dare to flaunt your seniority as if it matters?!

Disappointed Martial Artist:
Have you no heart...?

Meng Tieyi:
Good men need not remind the people of their past deeds. If you need to boast about it, that just goes to show how little it truly mattered.

Meng Tieyi:
Go home and make no further trouble. I will ensure your fallen brothers are spoken for.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
......

Disappointed Martial Artist:
...Yes, Master.

Meng Tieyi:
The blame lies with me, I neglected their discipline.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
We would never blame you.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
About those four brothers... you have my condolences.

Meng Tieyi:
I'll take care of their families. There's no need to bother the Lord Exorcist.

Meng Tieyi:
But since they died delivering a letter for Yumen, I'd like to ask the Lord Exorcist his opinion on the situation.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
We have to focus on the assassin for now, but when we're done, the Lord Exorcist will absolutely dispatch troops to clear out the bandits.

Meng Tieyi:
Right... you have to prioritize, that makes sense.

Meng Tieyi:
I just want a word with the Lord Exorcist. I need a reply, any kind of reply, to answer to those brothers.

Meng Tieyi:
Once we are done with this, you are all welcome to the Sword Forge for drinks.

Waai Fu:
Yühsia.

Lin Yühsia:
How's the situation on your end? Have the families of the victims been located?

Du Yaoye:
Actually, two of the four were living alone.

Du Yaoye:
As for the other two, their families happened to be away from home, so we took it upon ourselves to barge in.

Waai Fu:
It's a bit strange that all their homes looked so normal on the inside.

Du Yaoye:
Could it be a coincidence that they all just happened to be out?

Lin Yühsia:
A whole day has passed since we got the news of their deaths.

Lin Yühsia:
......

Waai Fu:
Who goes there?!

Du Yaoye:
You scared the life out of me!

Waai Fu:
I just felt like someone was watching us.

Du Yaoye:
You could sense that even in this crowd?

Lin Yühsia:
Let's continue this inside the inn.

Taihe:
Lin Yühsia, stay your steps.

Waai Fu:
You know this man...?

Lin Yühsia:
Just give me a moment, I'll have a few words with him.

Du Yaoye:
Alright.

Lin Yühsia:
I didn't expect the Monitor Censor of the Department of Discipline and Supervision to remember me. I think it's been five years since we last met?

Taihe:
The timing of our meeting was a memorable one.

Lin Yühsia:
But not very pleasant.

Taihe:
Just official business, you and I both.

Taihe:
Are you also here to investigate the events that have transpired in Yumen, Envoy Lin?

Lin Yühsia:
Can the Monitor Censor offer any leads?

Taihe:
No. At this time, I am not intervening in an official capacity.

Taihe:
I am merely acting as a former subordinate of the Lord Exorcist and as a subject of Yan, to apprehend the villains who disturb the people's peace.

Lin Yühsia:
I must say, I'm a little surprised that you aren't advising me to stay out of it, Monitor Censor Taihe.

Taihe:
I have no reason to dissuade you from your duties, Envoy Lin.

Taihe:
Do forgive me for prying, Envoy Lin. You have only just arrived in the city, so how exactly do you plan to investigate a case when you are yet unfamiliar with the situation?

Lin Yühsia:
I have my own means, of course. Don't you worry, Monitor Censor Taihe.

Taihe:
I have no doubt your means will prove more than adequate, Envoy Lin.

Lin Yühsia:
You might as well make your words clearer, Monitor Censor Taihe.

Taihe:
As I said, we are on official business, and nothing more than that.

Taihe:
I merely offer a reminder, Envoy Lin: the enemy lies in the open while we are hidden. But do be careful still.

Taihe:
I will take my leave.

Lin Yühsia:
......

Du Yaoye:
I've seen that big guy before, in Shangshu... I think he was from the Department of Discipline and Supervision?

Du Yaoye:
Just how many mandarins do you know?

Lin Yühsia:
It's not like we're friends. We just have prior dealings.

Du Yaoye:
What's the difference?

Lin Yühsia:
The difference is that you don't want to be friends with some people you have dealings with.

Lin Yühsia:
Let's go.

Dusk.

The sun goes down quickly in early spring, and the weather is still a little cold.

The old man fills the furnace with a handful of firewood.

The weak fire is not fit for forging or even for heating. These days, all the forge equipment runs on Originium, but the old man stubbornly keeps such a useless furnace here.

While waiting for the fire to intensify, he picks up a broom and carefully sweeps up the sand that has accumulated in the courtyard overnight, leaving none of the crevices between the stone bricks untouched.

Of course, the old man knows that it will only stay clean for a moment and will soon return to its sandy state.

But he still toils to sweep the ground over and over again, as if hoping to catch a glimpse of a completely clean forge.

Meng Tieyi:
These legs of mine are still ache from the cold, even the weather is getting warmer.

Meng Tieyi:
It's about closing time. If it isn't urgent, why not come back tomorrow?

Meng Tieyi:
Hm...?

Meng Tieyi:
Are you looking for someplace else, girl? This is a forge, not a clinic.

Exotically Dressed Girl:
I'm looking for... a place, mentioned in a story...

Meng Tieyi:
You're hurt too bad to be running around the city like this.

Meng Tieyi:
I hate to say it, but the city is under high alert right now. And a girl with a knife wound has shown up on my doorstep.

Meng Tieyi:
It'll be trouble for me if I don't take her in to the authorities.

Meng Tieyi:
The last thing I want is more trouble, so I'd better get her to explain where she came from.

Exotically Dressed Girl:
You.. are you the one called Meng Tieyi?

Meng Tieyi:
It means something that you know the name, young as you are.

Meng Tieyi:
But I don't recognize you at all.

Exotically Dressed Girl:
Shifu told me there is a forge hidden here in the nomadic city. And that the owner of the forge is a skilled swordsmith.

Exotically Dressed Girl:
He can make all kinds of weapons and armor, and also craft toys for the children of the city.

Meng Tieyi:
......

Meng Tieyi:
I can't recall anyone who would talk about this old man like that.

Exotically Dressed Girl:
In the yard of the forge lies a pagoda tree, transplanted by the both of you from a faraway place.

The old man can't help but look back.

In the corner of the yard stands a pagoda tree, leaves swaying slightly against the evening wind. Spring comes late in the north, and new leaves have yet to grow on the branches.

Shuo:
Now can we say that the battle is truly over.

Zuo Xuanliao:
We've suffered a number of casualties... but for the next twenty years at least, these bandits will be cowed.

Shuo:
I've heard tales from long ago, of expeditions celebrating their triumphs by carving out their achievements on the furthest mountains they could see. Perhaps today we are worthy of that legacy.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Hahaha. Not a bad idea, but we have only sand around us, and nothing solid on which to write.

Shuo:
There is a lone tree here, so why not...?

Meng Tieyi:
Good! Let's go with that!

Swordswoman:
Good?! This withered tree is about to crumble into dust, and you still want to torment it?

Shuo:
Do you have an alternative then?

Swordswoman:
What's the point of engraving your exploits on a fixed point when we live in a nomadic city that regularly travels thousands of li?

Swordswoman:
Why not we take this tree back and replant it in Yumen?

Swordswoman:
Our story will be remembered by the tree, if it manages to take root in the city, even for just a day.

Shuo:
*claps once*

Shuo:
Very well. Not a bad idea at all.

Meng Tieyi:
Did you get heatstroke from being out here too long? We're at least a hundred li from Yumen. Are you planning to carry the tree all the way back there?

Shuo:
Why not? We carried so much food and water on the way here and now it's all gone, so what's wrong with bringing an extra tree on our way back?

Shuo:
General Zuo, Tieyi, please lend me a hand. Careful not to damage the roots.

......

Meng Tieyi:
......

Meng Tieyi:
You called her Shifu...?

Exotically Dressed Girl:
Shifu saved mine and my family's lives out in the wilderness, and taught us how live among the settled.

Meng Tieyi:
What is your name?

Exotically Dressed Girl:
Jieyun.

Meng Tieyi:
If I'm not mistaken, you're an Anasa... yet you have such a refined name?

Jieyun:
Shifu gave it to me.

Meng Tieyi:
No wonder.

Meng Tieyi:
<i>Yun</i> dong qian li yu, <i>jie</i> zai ci shan qing. A classic poem. The cloud floats for a thousand li until it finally settles upon a mountaintop. She wished for you to find a home, like the cloud.

Jieyun:
Shifu recited it better than you, but the meaning is the same.

Meng Tieyi:
Ahah, I have no doubt.

Meng Tieyi:
Come to think of it, she gave the Grandmaster his name as well.

Jieyun:
That fickle-minded heartless man!

Meng Tieyi:
What's this then...?

Meng Tieyi:
Hold on, that sword you're carrying...

Meng Tieyi:
You stole the Grandmaster's sword?

Jieyun:
I will bring it to Shifu's grave, as an offering.

The wind whips up the leaves, rustling the old pagoda tree.

The fire in the furnace has died down, and the sky grown dark. But the old man does not move.

The girl can't see his expression clearly.

Meng Tieyi:
She—she's dead?

Jieyun:
Yes. Shifu's illness was very serious.

Meng Tieyi:
Certainly not.

Meng Tieyi:
Yumen is a very dangerous place to be right now.

Jieyun:
I know that with this sword on me, all the soldiers will be hunting for me.

Meng Tieyi:
No, what I'm saying is... the city will become even more dangerous in the near future.

Meng Tieyi:
It's about to face a test. But before that, I should at the very least try to get you out.

Meng Tieyi:
Your shifu is waiting for you... as are all of us.

Jieyun:
But how do you get out of the city?

Jieyun:
I didn't think about it when I came in. They sealed the gates, so I tried to force my way through... and was injured in the process.

The wind picks up.

A handful of fine sand flies onto the old man's face, and into the gap of time that has gone by.

It is soft, moist from the twilight hours of early spring

The old man kneads the sand in his fingers.

Meng Tieyi:
......

Meng Tieyi:
I have an idea.

Lee:
Hey, welcome back.

Lee:
What's the word?

Errand Runner:
No doctor or staff in the clinic, just some princely-looking official who asked me what I was doing.

Lee:
And what did you tell him...?

Errand Runner:
Just what you told me, 'Last night, I hurried over with a family member in tow, who suffered a concussion when our store shelves collapsed. We forgot to bring money for the bill, so I came back today to make the payment.'

Errand Runner:
The nobleman left after asking me the question. I don't get it.

Errand Runner:
Here's your money back, since I never had to pay anyone.

Lee:
Just keep it, take it as reimbursement for your hard work.

Errand Runner:
It's so strange... is Yumen's tourist season that lucrative?

Lin:
I've heard of Mr. Lee's skill, but to even pull one over on the young like that?

Lee:
That just any kid. He's a Sui Regulator Candleholder, I wouldn't dare lie to him...

Lee:
Just helping him rule out a wrong answer.

Lee:
As for Mr. Lin, what are you doing here...?

Lin:
Just out for a stroll.

Lee:
If we were in Lungmen Park right now, I'd believe it.

Lin:
And how are things coming along for you, Mr. Lee?

Lee:
It's a little strange. I haven't been able to figure out exactly what the job is you've asked me to do, but the one I've been looking for might be able to clue me in.

Lin:
That's good to hear.

Lee:
You've tasked me with the job, but you still look uneasy. Why not take matters into your own hands?

Lin:
Any action I take would affect Wei Yenwu's reputation.

Lin:
I also want to just watch from the sidelines and see how she does things.

Lee:
Now that's the Mr. Lin I know. This is an important moment, but there's still ample time to make a probing move.

Lin:
A beard well lathered is already half shaved. I have trust in you as well, Mr. Lee.

Lin:
Wei Yenwu has often lamented your decision to not stay with the L.G.D.

Lee:
Let's not talk about that...

Lee:
Wei Yenwu... doesn't let go of somebody, if he's decided they're useful to him.

Lee:
Speaking of which, are you still determined to have your girl Yühsia take over your work?

Lin:
That's not for me to decide.

Lin:
If she wants to stay, Lungmen will have a place for her. If she wants to leave, Lungmen won't trouble her.

Lin:
I would like you to take care of her, no matter what path she takes, Mr. Lee.

Lee:
It's an honor to have your trust, Mr. Lin.

Lee:
If there's anything I can do to help out, I will give it my all.

Lin:
Do ze.

Lin:
Now then, time to stop bothering you and continue my stroll.

Lee:
Oh, Huai Tianpei... he's a father too...?

Lee:
*sigh*

Meng Tieyi:
Did you see the city-wide notice issued by the Patrol Battalion on your way here?

Meng Tieyi:
According to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau's latest calculations, Yumen needs to adjust course to avoid a Catastrophe.

Meng Tieyi:
Starting tomorrow, at the Hour of Shen, the city will begin to slow down. By around the Hour of Yu, it will have dropped to its lowest speed, and will pick up again once the course has corrected.

Meng Tieyi:
Your chance lies within that timeframe.

Jieyun:
But if the city slows down, won't the gates be even more closely guarded?

Meng Tieyi:
Dear girl, did you take a good look around you before entering Yumen?

Meng Tieyi:
A desert spanning thousands of li, with only misfortune and the occasional traveler to meet, but a part of Yanese territory still. From the very beginning, Yumen was designed as a military fortress to guard the north.

Meng Tieyi:
Which is why the city has 'sand sluices' in dams on the outer wall, unlike conventional nomadic cities.

Jieyun:
......

Meng Tieyi:
Normally, the sand sluice would never serve as a path for people to walk on.

Meng Tieyi:
If one jumps into the sand sluice, he can only expect to be crushed by the turbines, or suffocate under the rolling yellow sand.

Meng Tieyi:
So tomorrow, at the Hour of Yu, when Yumen is travelling at its lowest speed, the flow of sand through the sluices will also be slowed... but at least there's a ghost of a chance in this idea.

Jieyun:
I'll do it! I need to get out of the city, by any means.

Meng Tieyi:
But what about your wounds?

Jieyun:
I'll manage.

Meng Tieyi:
......

Jieyun:
I went to a clinic earlier.

Meng Tieyi:
Good.

Meng Tieyi:
It's just that, security around the sand sluices is usually lax, but I'm not sure if things have changed now with the city under high alert.

Jieyun:
On my way here, I heard the general of this city is personally leading the defense of the keep.

Meng Tieyi:
It seems...

Meng Tieyi:
To meet or not to meet, that was the question. But it seems the answer is meet.

Jieyun:
You're going out?

Meng Tieyi:
We have to be quick, I need to go scout the surroundings. There are also some preparations to be made, if you're to leave the city via the sand sluices.

Meng Tieyi:
I'll hang a 'Closed' sign on the door while I'm out, so make use of this time to recuperate.

Meng Tieyi:
I'll come back to fetch you.

???:
Daai Siu Ze.

Waai Fu:
Yühsia?

Lin Yühsia:
Head up to my room first, I'll be there in a minute.

Lin Yühsia:
Any news?

Lungmen Agent:
Not long after you left, some people in smiths' clothes showed up, moved their goods and headed someplace else.

Lungmen Agent:
I tried to follow them, but they seem to be in our line of work. They realized someone was tailing them and quickly shook me off their trail.

Lungmen Agent:
I returned to the warehouse to take another look, and it had been cleared out completely. I don't know what these people are hiding, but it's clear that something strange is going on.

Lungmen Agent:
Your intuition was spot on, there's something off about that Sword Forge.

Lin Yühsia:
I'm afraid we've already set the enemy on alert, and we've yet to find our key evidence.

Lin Yühsia:
The dark clouds over the city get thicker every day, while the sand in the wind is also denser.

Lin Yühsia:
The situation is urgent. Since we have our suspects, we can try some things out.

Lungmen Agent:
Daai Siu Ze?

Lin Yühsia:
Go to the barracks and fetch something for me.
