Anxious Civilian:
Hey, my bag! Don't push!

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
There's plenty of time, folks. Don't panic, get in line, careful not to step on each other.

Panicked Child:
Mama...

Panicked Child:
I'm scared...

Mother:
Don't be scared, just hold my hand and stay close.

Panicked Child:
Where are we going?

Mother:
There's a big storm coming.

Mother:
So we're going to a safe place where we won't be blown away.

Massive shadows begin rising from outside the walls, blocking out the sun.

The Four Guardians of Yumen, retractable external mobile barriers known as the Wind Aegis, designed by Tumu Tianshi and built by the military's Department of Smelting and Fabrication.

For centuries, Yumen has served as Yan's border bulwark, and the Wind Aegis have been her shield, protecting her from the sandstorms, winter winds and Originium storms of the great desert.

The Three Winds shall not pass as long as the Four Guardians stand.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
Wow, it's so tall...

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
I've never seen the Wind Aegis deploy in all my three years in Yumen.

Millenion:
Nothing to gape at.

Millenion:
Yumen's walls are tall, and fully equipped with Originium defenses. Mundane Catastrophes rarely require the Wind Aegis to be deployed, but it's not entirely unheard of.

Millenion:
However, this is the first time that we've had to move half the city's population, as far as I know...

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
So, er, wh-what is the class of this Catastrophe? So big not even the Wind Aegis could hold it back?

The Wind Aegis lock into place, steel plates interlocked so tightly not even the wind can get through.

Long lines of civilians move away from the walls in the shadows that the Wind Aegis cast. Perhaps comforted by the sturdy presence of the barriers, the crowd calms down after some initial chaos.

The poplars that grow on the borderlands have grown used to the wind and sand.

Millenion:
What's the matter? Scared?

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
......

Millenion:
Man your post. Don't think about anything else.

Millenion:
Keep your eyes open. The Shanhaizhong are still in the city. Anything can happen with so many people moving about.

Millenion:
Protect the commoners.

Lungmen Agent:
You're still here?

Lungmen Agent:
They've been broadcasting it all day. Yumen is about to run into a Catastrophe. Those on the east side need to move to shelters on the west side before noon.

Innkeeper:
I know, I know. The Catastrophe cloud isn't here yet. I need to pack my things...

Innkeeper:
Here it is.

Innkeeper:
I could lose the tables, the chairs, even the building, but not this recipe book.

Lungmen Agent:
Say, you could come with me to Lungmen, if you lost the inn.

Innkeeper:
Don't say that!

Lungmen Agent:
Sorry, yeah. That's bad luck.

Lungmen Agent:
I just figured your culinary skills would do well in Lungmen too. I've had the chance to see you work up close these few days, after all.

Innkeeper:
Nah, can't have that.

Innkeeper:
Where would the people of Yumen get my special sauteed meat if I left?

Lungmen Agent:
Are you a native of Yumen?

Innkeeper:
No.

Innkeeper:
I was born in the heartlands and went to Lungmen to seek my fortune. I came over when the cities linked, wanting to see what things were like in the north.

Innkeeper:
Then I lost my wallet and started working at this inn to make ends meet. Now I've been the innkeeper for years.

Innkeeper:
The building doesn't matter. Houses can be rebuilt.

Lungmen Agent:
Absolutely.

Lungmen Agent:
Well, I'll help you back up.

The winds are calm.

The dark, ominous mass of air is clearly visible, even from a distance, darkening part of the sky.

The Catastrophe does not seem to have moved, but the temperature is rising.

It is as though it is waiting for a gust of wind, before lashing out at the city walls.

Ling:
Phew...

Ling:
Come to watch my brother's duel, General?

Zuo Xuanliao:
Catastrophe preparations are already done. The Grandmaster wants to see whether that one is worth his trust before the Catastrophe strikes. I can't miss this.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Still, it seems absurd to determine the sword's ownership in this way.

Ling:
You've been at my brother's side for decades. You would not trust his choice as a friend?

Zuo Xuanliao:
...Friend.

Ling:
Hm.

Zuo Xuanliao:
We have fought side-by-side, but we have never been brothers. Neither sword nor spear, nor gun nor cannon can harm your kind. How could you truly understand the camaraderie of man?

Zuo Xuanliao:
You remain outsiders to it all.

Ling:
......

Ling:
'Outsiders'?

Ling:
You could say that about me, but it seems unfair to apply it to my brother.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Man and beast are different. This has never changed.

Zuo Xuanliao:
You know how the imperial court views your kind.

Zuo Xuanliao:
An alliance can only endure when the two sides are equals. One should not wield power beyond one's control.

Zuo Xuanliao:
I'm not in a position to trust him unconditionally, for I'm not his equal.

Ling:
I'm surprised you would be so frank.

Ling:
But perhaps you underestimate yourself...

Zuo Xuanliao gazes wordlessly at the great desert beyond. The two shadows there are like two drops of ink on a great scroll.

Heaven and earth are silent.

Ling:
It all feels like it happened yesterday.

Ling:
We partook in more than just war. We hunted, drank, and sang together. Yumen is still Yumen. Why is it that you have worries enough to turn your hair white?

Ling:
Does the sight of those two remind you of those golden days?

Ling:
You say that man and beast are different, but look, a man has chosen to challenge this great barrier. Does your heart not race at a clash like that?

Zuo Xuanliao:
......

Ling:
Loosen that brow of yours.

Ling:
Care for a drink? We could even make a wager.

Huai Tianpei:
Good, good.

Huai Tianpei:
You finally agreed to fight me.

Chongyue:
Sorry for making you wait.

Huai Tianpei:
It's only been three years. I could wait longer, if you have unfinished business.

Three years ago...

Huai Tianpei:
Hold it.

Chongyue:
......

Chongyue:
That was just one exchange.

Huai Tianpei:
It was enough.

Huai Tianpei:
We traded three blows in that exchange. Someone could have been hurt, if we were using our full strength.

Huai Tianpei:
But you're holding back, and I can't use my full strength either.

Huai Tianpei:
That's no fun.

Chongyue:
Sparring is about restraint...

Huai Tianpei:
Screw sparring, screw restraint! Let's have a proper fight!

Huai Tianpei:
All the kung fu under Heaven evolved in the struggle of life and death. You're not talking like the top-ranked fighter on the Yumen Arena Board of Fame.

Chongyue:
You have a point. However...

Huai Tianpei:
Fine, I know, you have a job to do. You're not in a position to go all-out.

Huai Tianpei:
When are you quitting? We'll put this off until then.

Chongyue:
Well, I have no idea when that might be.

Huai Tianpei:
Guesstimate it for me.

Chongyue:
Could be three years, five, ten, maybe more.

Huai Tianpei:
Alright. I'll wait.

Huai Tianpei:
You're right here, after all. I'm not worried you'll run away.

Chongyue:
There's always more to do. This is the right time and place for the fight that I owe you.

Chongyue:
I should explain that I have my own reasons for doing this.

Huai Tianpei:
Oh?

Chongyue:
There's a tradition of military commanders sparring before their troops prior to a campaign, in order to inspire the men.

Chongyue:
Yumen is about to fight a Catastrophe. This bout between you and I will inspire the warriors of the city.

Huai Tianpei:
Suits me just fine, as long as you're not worried about losing face when I make you eat dirt in front of the whole city.

Chongyue:
Haha...

Chongyue:
It's been many years since someone challenged me like this.

Huai Tianpei:
It's been many years since I've seen someone worth challenging like you.

Huai Tianpei:
Ready to give me your all?

Chongyue:
Hold nothing back.

Huai Tianpei:
Victory and defeat lie in the hands of man.

Chongyue:
Life and death lie in the hands of Heaven.

Du Yaoye:
Did they start yet?!

Waai Fu:
Hey, take it easy, you're injured.

Du Yaoye:
I'm a trained kung fu fighter. I'm not so fragile.

Du Yaoye:
There's plenty of time to rest later. Miss this fight, and I may never see one like it ever again!

Waai Fu:
It's not that big a deal...

Du Yaoye:
The Feline is your dad, right? The good-for-nothing old man you were talking about?

Du Yaoye:
I definitely see the resemblance. Like father, like daughter.

Waai Fu:
In what way?

Du Yaoye:
The way you look before a fight.

Du Yaoye:
Like you're gonna eat someone.

Waai Fu:
Hmph...

Du Yaoye:
I hear the Grandmaster's skills are almost supernatural. He hasn't fought in public in years. Some even say that he invented half the kung fu under Heaven.

Du Yaoye:
And I hear your dad defeated that evil woman last night.

Du Yaoye:
Who do you think will win here?

Waai Fu:
......

Du Yaoye:
Silly question. Of course you want your dad to win.

Waai Fu:
That's his business, not mine.

Waai Fu:
I just want to see for myself how big the gap between us is.

Lee:
Mr. Liang...

Lee:
I didn't think you would be interested in such violent business.

Liang Xun:
I ought to be here. As a friend.

Liang Xun:
I wonder if he achieved his goal of making a name for himself.

Lee:
Look at the number of eyes on this fight. It'll be the stuff of legend, no matter who wins.

Lee:
A lunatic must answer to himself before telling others who he is.

Liang Xun:
We must all answer to ourselves.

Liang Xun:
You...

Lee:
I was looking for Waai Tinpâ€”Err, Huai Tianpei before trouble found me.

Lee:
I went back to my old detective tricks and found out a few things. I have a good idea of what you're planning.

Liang Xun:
There's probably a reason why trouble finds you.

Lee:
A big brother must look after his siblings.

Liang Xun:
What did you hear?

Lee:
Few know that the Grandmaster is Ling's eldest brother. Seems like it's being kept a secret.

Liang Xun:
True...

Lee:
Retrieving the Grandmaster's sword is, of course, an urgent matter, but the bigger headache is what to do with it afterwards.

Lee:
You don't want it at Yumen. Perhaps you speak for the Sui Regulator, perhaps it's your judgment as advisor to Yumen, but the Lord Exorcist won't let it go.

Lee:
You needed someone who could take the sword, someone both sides can live with.

Lee:
You just happen to have an oath-brother who is a kung fu master, and he just happens to be in Yumen.

Lee:
It didn't take much effort to guide the girl to the clinic where Huai Tianpei worked, in order to ensure his involvement.

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
From Shangshu to Yumen, you always get your old friends to solve your problems. Isn't that a little lazy?

Liang Xun:
I don't have many friends.

Lee:
Question for you.

Lee:
When did you start thinking about getting Huai Tianpei involved?

Liang Xun:
......

Lee:
Never mind, no need to tell me.

Lee:
*sigh*...

Lee:
No matter how many strings you pulled behind the scenes, it was always his lifelong wish to fight the best and become the best. He might even thank you for setting the stage, if he knew.

Liang Xun:
We are all doing what we wanted to, even if things often don't turn out the way we want.

Lee:
After all these years, perhaps he's the one who's closest to his oldest dreams.

Lee:
'Achieve one thing in life.' Easy for him to say...

Record Keeper:
Mr. Huai came, despite his injuries...

Qiubai:
He would have come as long as there was a single breath left in him. He doesn't care if it's the last thing he does.

Record Keeper:
I know Mr. Huai came to Yumen to challenge the Grandmaster, and the Grandmaster accepted the challenge. The Grandmaster has spoken of it from time to time, and I can tell you that he's no less looking forward to this than Mr. Huai is.

Qiubai:
All kung fu fighters thirst for a good opponent.

Qiubai:
It's an obsession, a strange one. It's natural that you don't understand.

Record Keeper:
It's the same reason that you follow the Grandmaster.

Qiubai:
You can actually be kind of astute at times, you know that?

Record Keeper:
......

Record Keeper:
I'll head down now.

Qiubai:
It's two masters at work. Nothing in your records will come close to what you are about to see.

Record Keeper:
I'll try to be detailed.

Qiubai:
Just keep your distance. You don't want to get hurt.

Record Keeper:
Of course.

Earlier that day...

Qiubai:
Today's the day, isn't it?

Chongyue:
......

Chongyue:
Are you ready?

Qiubai:
The veterans say Yumen has been through many crises in the past, but nothing on this scale.

Qiubai:
Not even you know what's going to come of it, do you?

Chongyue:
Things are more complicated than meets the eye.

From Jiangqi to Yumen, how many times has she seen danger, seen her life hang by a thread?

Yet she did not die in the wilderness, nor did she become like the Shanhaizhong.

What is it that has kept her going?

Qiubai:
This city has treated me well. I should do something for it.

Qiubai:
Before that, however, I must answer to myself.

Qiubai:
You said that you would fight me whenever I felt up to it.

Chongyue:
I did.

Chongyue:
Strike me, if you're ready.

Qiubai:
......

Qiubai takes a step back, focuses, and raises her sword.

She knows that he knows her every move like the back of his hand.

An eye for an eye.

Is there wisdom in the saying, or is it simply a result?

How many people have fed the fins by the river fort? Should their families seek revenge on her father?

How many people would seek revenge on her, if she killed this one in front of her for the sake of her own revenge?

The cycle of vengeance never ends.

Should it really be hate that keeps her going?

How long has she been thinking about that question? The five years that she has been around this man, seeing all that he saw?

No, longer than that.

Her sword has seen blood every step of the way from Jiangqi to Yumen. How would she judge those dead by it?

That is why she came to Yumen, for revenge, and to learn.

Exact what must be exacted, and discern what must be discerned.

The sword is pulled back abruptly.

It leaves her hand and falls into a nearby ditch, sending a pack of fowlbeasts scattering in all directions.

The violence of the move almost injures her, showing none of her usual grace in practice or battle.

Her expression, however, is one of satisfaction.

Qiubai:
That will do.

Qiubai:
The sword has been thrust. It couldn't have killed you.

Chongyue:
...Correct.

Qiubai:
I didn't let go of vengeance because I can't kill you, though.

Qiubai:
It's just not worth my sword anymore.

Chongyue:
It seems you have made great strides in the past three years.

Chongyue:
We...

Huai Tianpei:
We've said too much.

Chongyue:
I just...

Chongyue stops mid-sentence.

His opponent is injured. A few more words would give him time to adjust his breathing.

But he soon realizes that such kindness would be an insult to his opponent.

There is no such thing as a truly fair fight.

Cast away irrelevant thoughts, and give all for victory. That is what 'fair' is.

Chongyue:
Let's begin.

Huai Tianpei clutches his fist, feeling the lines etched into his palm.

They are the marks of forty years of kung fu practice, his pride, his very emblem.

He's waited three years for this fight, but the preparation for it began on his first day studying kung fu.

A martial artist always aspires to the top.

The wind is still. The world is silent.
