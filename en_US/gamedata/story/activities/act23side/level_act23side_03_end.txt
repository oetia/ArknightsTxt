Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
The deed is still not done?

Malicious Shanhaizhong Member:
There was some serious kung fu on both sides, so we had no chance to strike.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Leave that young Candleholder to his own devices, he won't affect our plans.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
But the woman from Lungmen was never accounted for, and she's still after us.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
What a pain.

Malicious Shanhaizhong Member:
We'll keep an eye on things, and make a move when the time is right.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
No, after these two clashes, the mandarins will definitely be on alert, so we have to be more cautious.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
I can let the woman live for another two days, but our organization can leave no clues.

Malicious Shanhaizhong Member:
Right... Then what do we do now?

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Just wait. It won't be long before he gives us fresh orders.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
'The mounts, seas, and all in between shall be our master's.'

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
They've stolen the land without even knowing it... the people will pay for their arrogance.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Soon.

Taihe:
And who might you be waiting for?

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
......

Taihe:
Attempted assassination of a court official and disturbing the people's peace. Your conduct befouls the laws of Great Yan. It's like they mean nothing to you.

Taihe:
You have two options.

Taihe:
Lay down your arms and come with me. Or I bring you in.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
You were followed.

Malicious Shanhaizhong Member:
It's the same man from before.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
He turned the tables on you. Considering his skill, it's no surprise you couldn't do anything about it.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
But in the end, it was still you who led this man here, do you understand?

Malicious Shanhaizhong Member:
Yes.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Good. Now, we'll get rid of him first, and then decide how to deal with you.

Taihe:
You dare?!

Wei Yenwu:
Late as it is, you're still awake?

Chongyue:
We must be vigilant, lest something like yesterday's incident happen again.

Wei Yenwu:
Surely the Grandmaster has not invited me out so late to enjoy the scenery?

Chongyue:
It's auspicious for Lord Wei to stand here with us at such a crucial moment. Indeed, it would have been best to take a stroll through the city of Yumen and enjoy its scenery.

Wei Yenwu:
The Lord Exorcist's decision naturally comes after careful consideration.

Wei Yenwu:
Perhaps this is not for me to say, but the Lord Exorcist's responsibilities reach far beyond the safety and security of Yumen.

Wei Yenwu:
The consequences of just one mishap are grave enough that the word 'trust' no longer carries much weight.

Chongyue:
Indeed, it is so. General Zuo and I have worked together for decades, without relying on 'trust'.

Wei Yenwu:
I hope you understand.

Chongyue:
Have I ever expressed any dissatisfaction?

Wei Yenwu:
Speaking of which, we have yet to properly catch up on each other's affairs.

Wei Yenwu:
The last time I came to Yumen was five years ago, and the time before that was ten, but both were hectic visits.

Chongyue:
And our last meeting, let me think... we were in the capital.

Chongyue:
Yes, the year you left the capital, I had happened to be there to report on my work.

Wei Yenwu:
I didn't expect you to remember something from so long ago.

Chongyue:
Do you not remember it, Lord Wei?

Chongyue:
I don't recall what year it was, exactly, but my memories tell me it was also spring then.

Wei Yenwu:
Late spring. A little later than the current season.

Chongyue:
That's it.

Chongyue:
At the time, you still wielded a sword... And you were not yet called 'Wei.'

Wei Yenwu:
......

Chongyue:
There was much scenery to enjoy, and plenty of kung fu spectacles too. I have lived for so long, there are not many who leave a true impression.

Chongyue:
But even now, as I evaluate the various styles of kung fu, I still think about Chi Xiao's ultimate move.

Wei Yenwu:
I'm honored to win such a praise from the Grandmaster of kung fu.

Chongyue:
That night seemed like it was set to rain, the weather stifling, the clouds looming low.

Chongyue:
I was on the keep, and far away, but even then I saw a light in the direction of the posthouse.

Chongyue:
The sky abruptly broke with the chill of a sword. A sharp and decisive style of swordsmanship.

Chongyue:
'As sword of stratus rent, once stood stand fast.'

Chongyue:
Afterwards, Lord Wei must have left the city. In the end, the rain did not fall.

Wei Yenwu:
It was a very long time ago.

Wei Yenwu:
But I wonder why you're bringing this up?

The tower stands high, the two men's clothes rustle in the breeze.

Even though it is a windless night.

As far as the eye can see, Yumen's sentries and buildings stretch on without end. Only through the wind on the highest of points can one clearly perceive that the city is moving at a high speed.

Chongyue:
There is treachery in the court, and minds can be unpredictable. Surely, no one understands this better than you.

Chongyue:
But I also believe that whose mind is consumed by ambition and cunning could never wield that style of swordsmanship.

Chongyue:
There is a matter that I would like you to help with.

Wei Yenwu:
I dare not refuse a request from the Grandmaster himself.

Chongyue:
I would ask you to trust Yumen, just this once.

Wei Yenwu:
......

Chongyue:
You and the Lord Exorcist are alike, shouldering the peace of Yan. There are many matters of concern... but in the end, Yumen is unlike Lungmen.

Chongyue:
Yumen was built on strength of arms, and most of the people here practice kung fu. These people have great passion, but lack strategic thinking.

Chongyue:
Regardless, everyone here acts for the country and its people, and there is nothing wrong with hating evil as an enemy.

Wei Yenwu:
I only fear that simple-minded people will be manipulated without their knowing.

Chongyue:
General Zuo has agreed to a time limit of three days. Within these three days, you will get your answer.

Chongyue:
Until then, I hope you will set your grievances with the Lord Exorcist aside, and stay your hand.

Wei Yenwu:
A guest must comply with his host, and the Lord Exorcist has asked me to wait in these barracks at ease. I simply wished to share his burden, but there is really nothing I can do.

Chongyue:
I recall, that Envoy Lin of Lungmen from a few days past is indeed shrewd and capable, solving several cases cleanly in just a few days' work.

Chongyue:
I imagine there must be several talents like her in your employ.

Wei Yenwu:
...You might be overthinking the situation.

Wei Yenwu:
Whether the Grand Tutor, the Lord Exorcist, or Wei Yenwu, every move is calculated for the safety of the people and prosperity of the country.

Wei Yenwu:
There should be no conflict between us.

Chongyue:
But looking back over the few millennia... there have been those who shared a goal, but a number of them inevitably break and even turn against each other, yes?

Wei Yenwu:
Indeed, you are most qualified to speak of this.

Wei Yenwu:
Very well, for your sake... I will agree to your request.

Chongyue:
You have my thanks, Lord Wei.

Wei Yenwu:
The night is no longer young, I suggest you retire.

Wei Yenwu:
Oh, but... there is another thing, I think I have yet to mention.

Wei Yenwu:
'Cloud-splitting sword' is not actually Chi Xiao's ultimate move.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
(repressed gasping)

Taihe:
Now, you still hold the option to surrender. Choose that option, or you will never stand again.

Malicious Shanhaizhong Member:
(Anguished groaning)

Taihe:
Right now it is merely at your waist, move again and the dirt will bury you up to your shoulders.

Taihe:
Three more of you lie in hiding in the alley on the left, and two more in the eaves on the right.

Taihe:
Your actions were to draw out my weakness and create an opportunity for an ambush.

Taihe:
But you will not get such a chance.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
I admit, I've underestimated your strength.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
It's rare... for one to be proficient in both kung fu and Originium Arts.

Taihe:
You are unworthy to comment on my kung fu.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
...Hmph.

Taihe:
Yesterday, Envoy Lin of the L.G.D. fended off an attack while returning to the city, and was followed today with errant intent. Earlier, a Sui Regulator Candleholder met with an assassin in the city center, these acts were most probably all your doing, correct?

Taihe:
To intercept and kill a Catastrophe Messenger, to steal Catastrophe data, just what are the Shanhaizhong planning in Yumen?

Taihe:
Who exactly is behind you?

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
You'd better check who's behind you first!

Taihe:
What—

Aloof Woman:
......

Malicious Shanhaizhong Member:
Thank... thank you very much for saving my life...

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
I'm sorry for all that.

Shanhaizhong Boss?:
You shouldn't be wasting your time here.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
The Lungmenite woman investigated the warehouse at the Sword Forge. She's making a lot of trouble...

Shanhaizhong Boss:
If you're so worried about trouble, why not go directly to the only variable that can sway the whole situation?

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
The old man at the Sword Forge.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Go find him, and let the Catastrophe data disappear along with his body.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Understood.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Master, look out—

Shanhaizhong Boss:
......

Shanhaizhong Boss:
You shouldn't be able to stand.

Taihe:
Rest... go...

The ground suddenly sinks beneath them, as if charged with vitality. The raised earth and rocks surround everyone in an instant.

Shanhaizhong Ringleader:
Master, this man is not to be underestimated—

A cold light flashes for just a moment.

A man falls to the ground, earth and rock unmoving.

The block is dead silent.

Shanhaizhong Boss:
Waste of time, and boring beyond comprehension.

Waai Fu:
Yühsia, what took you so long?

Lin Yühsia:
I happened to meet an acquaintance, so I took the chance to say hello.

Du Yaoye:
You're a Lungmenite, and yet you seem to know plenty of people in Yumen...

Du Yaoye:
Well, that's enough talking. Let's piece together the information we gathered and see if we can figure anything out.

Du Yaoye:
I didn't get to finish that conversation on the street, what progress have you made on your end?

Lin Yühsia:
Miss Du, what kind of person owns the Sword Forge?

Du Yaoye:
You mean Uncle Meng?

Lin Yühsia:
Yes.

Du Yaoye:
He's an old friend of my father's, from when he was still in the business. His kung fu is renowned, but he's good at talking too, and every martial artist in Yumen trusts him.

Du Yaoye:
I'm not familiar with Yumen, so Xingyu Logistics being able to operate here is all thanks to him.

Du Yaoye:
......

Du Yaoye:
Does this stuff have anything to do with Uncle Meng?

Lin Yühsia:
Just wondering.

Du Yaoye:
If you have something to say, get to the point already!

Lin Yühsia:
I've had a suspicion that this band of thieves causing chaos in the city stowed away with the supplies smuggled from Lungmen.

Lin Yühsia:
I've been on the smugglers' trail and it led me to the Sword Forge's warehouse.

Du Yaoye:
So? What did you find?

Lin Yühsia:
The warehouse had only iron billets and forge fuel. All the materials you would need for a forge.

Lin Yühsia:
What was strange was the warehouse guard.

Lin Yühsia:
He had an unusual sunburn around his neck. Looked like a mark from wearing special protective equipment.

Lin Yühsia:
As I understand it, the Catastrophe Survey Teams dispatched by the Imperial Astronomical Bureau trek through the desert for long periods of time, and they wear a standardized mask for protection against the wind and sun.

Du Yaoye:
......

Lin Yühsia:
That sunburn wasn't faded. And the Imperial Astronomical Bureau has only dispatched that one team lately.

Du Yaoye:
So you're saying there's something suspicious about the team, and that they're connected to Uncle Meng?

Lin Yühsia:
I'm trying to get us on the same page with the facts I've found.

Du Yaoye:
Yumen has just returned from the depths of the desert, where the sunlight can be intense, and sunburns are common among the city residents.

Du Yaoye:
Is that one little thing all you've got to make you suspicious?

Lin Yühsia:
Do you recognize this object?

Waai Fu:
......

Du Yaoye:
(voice shaking) Where did you find this?

Lin Yühsia:
The warehouse.

Lin Yühsia:
I found it lying in a corner. It seemed unique, and was standing out from the piles of iron billets and fuel.

Du Yaoye:
This is a 'Xingyu Logistics' armband that I designed myself.

The red armband is inlaid with gold trim, as well as a Shangshu-style embroidery of twin lines flowing through a pattern of five-pointed stars, symbolizing auspicious and smooth trade routes.

The signifiers of luck and peace are dyed a disturbing ochre-red, and the stains of yellow sand make it look mottled and old.

Du Yaoye:
Only the kids who followed me to Yumen from Shangshu would have this. Did the Qis also...?

Du Yaoye:
If what befell the Messenger team happened outside Yumen, then this shouldn't have made it into the city at all!

Du Yaoye:
Are the Qis still alive?! If they are, then why are they hiding? No, who's holding them and keeping them from showing themselves?

Du Yaoye:
Uncle Meng? But doesn't he have four men he knows on the team.

Du Yaoye:
What's going on?

Waai Fu:
Miss Du, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We need to calmly analyze the...

Du Yaoye:
If I can't figure it out, then I might as well stop thinking. I'll just head to the Sword Forge and get my answer!

Waai Fu:
Miss Du!

Lin Yühsia:
......

Waai Fu:
Yühsia.

Lin Yühsia:
Mhm.

Waai Fu:
I saw a tourist dressed like a Lungmenite downstairs earlier, probably one of your men?

Waai Fu:
He came to pass you something, right?

Lin Yühsia:
......

Lin Yühsia:
That armband was evidence brought back from where the Messenger team was intercepted and killed outside the city.

Waai Fu:
You're using Miss Du.

Lin Yühsia:
We have a lot of clues pointing us towards the Sword Forge right now, so we need to probe it a little.

Lin Yühsia:
If the man is innocent, then we've ruled out a decent possibility, and she will also feel at ease.

Waai Fu:
If there's really something up with the Sword Forge, won't you have put her in danger?

Lin Yühsia:
She's certainly not the only one in danger here in Yumen.

Waai Fu:
Yühsia, I know you have your responsibilities, and maybe this is how you've always done things.

Waai Fu:
I'm not about to argue with you over what's right or wrong, but I can't agree with your approach.

Waai Fu:
I have to go help her.

Zuo Le:
......

Yumen Sentry:
Lord Zuo.

Zuo Le:
What happened?!

The tall Forte lies on the hospital bed, his visage pale. He's barely still breathing.

In Zuo Le's memories, Taihe was always like a mountain.

This mountain stood beside his father and himself, unshakeable.

What sort of force could break this mountain? Zuo Le has never considered such a possibility.

Yumen Sentry:
Monitor Censor Taihe was brought to a military camp by two civilians not long ago...

Zuo Le:
Tell me his condition first!

Yumen Sentry:
T-The medics say they've managed to save his life... but perhaps only his life...

Yumen Sentry:
Monitor Censor Taihe has suffered multiple external injuries, but what's more serious is the damage to his organs. He has suffered massive internal bleeding. If he were an ordinary man, I'm afraid he would have already...

Zuo Le:
Uncle Taihe shouldn't have been involved in this, he was helping me under the table...

Zuo Le:
Where is Father?

Yumen Sentry:
The General is guarding the outer city tower.

Yumen Sentry:
I've also notified the General, and there were only four words in his reply.

Yumen Sentry:
'Stay at your post.'

Zuo Le:
......

Zuo Le:
Where are the ones who brought Uncle Taihe here?

Zuo Le:
Tell me the truth.

Nervous Passerby:
We just saw the Forte dressed in mandarin clothes lying by the roadside. We have no idea what happened, but we figured we should bring him over here...

Zuo Le:
The city is under high alert right now. What were you doing out so late at night?

Nervous Passerby:
We had trouble sleeping, so we went out for a walk... who would've thought there would be someone lying by the roadside as soon as we went out? Terrifying.

Zuo Le:
So you live in the area, but heard nothing strange?

Nervous Passerby:
Nothing...

Zuo Le:
Where did you find the wounded?

Nervous Passerby:
In the south of the city, near the Sword Forge's alley!

Zuo Le:
The Sword Forge...

Nervous Passerby:
Sorry... Can I can go home now?

Zuo Le:
No.

Zuo Le:
Your testimony is unclear, so as a witness, you can't leave just yet.

Nervous Passerby:
Ah, w-well...

Zuo Le:
Millenion.

Millenion:
Present.

Zuo Le:
I'm moving out. Gather your team.

Zuo Le:
Search the Sword Forge.

Millenion:
Sir... The General's orders were to stick to our posts.

Zuo Le:
Father ordered me to hunt down the assassin and locate the sword in three days to restore peace in Yumen. Even with his strength, Monitor Censor Taihe has been gravely injured. This surely has some link to the Feranmut followers.

Zuo Le:
Going to the scene of the crime to find the truth and arrest the culprit, is that not sticking to my post?!

Millenion:
......

Zuo Le:
Go.

Millenion:
Yes, sir.
