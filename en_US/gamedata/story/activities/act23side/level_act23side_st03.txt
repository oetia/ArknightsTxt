Ch'en:
How is Mr. Lin doing?

Lin Yühsia:
The doctor says he'll be fine.

Lin Yühsia:
It's just that his old injuries and overuse of Arts have taken a toll on him.

Lin Yühsia:
Dad is getting old, after all.

Ch'en:
Sometimes I forget how long Mr. Lin has served Lungmen.

Lin Yühsia:
Dad is not like Chief Wei. As the symbol of Lungmen, Chief Wei always stays in the public eye.

Lin Yühsia:
But Lungmen doesn't exactly want everyone remembering that there is a Rat King of Downtown.

Ch'en:
I heard Wei Yenwu dragged you into this.

Lin Yühsia:
It became my business when I chose to accept it, of my own accord.

Lin Yühsia:
And it all turned out fine, thanks to a certain someone.

Ch'en:
Tsk.

Lin Yühsia:
This incident also helped me answer a couple of questions.

Ch'en:
Are you going to Victoria? We could travel together.

Lin Yühsia:
No, my plans have changed.

Lin Yühsia:
I'm going back to Lungmen.

Ch'en:
What do you mean by 'going back to Lungmen?'

Lin Yühsia:
I'm staying.

Lin Yühsia:
Throwing off your burdens sounds nice, but whatever you throw off, somebody else has to pick up.

Lin Yühsia:
Whether one leaves or stays is up to oneself, but someone has to take care of Lungmen.

Ch'en:
Mm...

Lin Yühsia:
I said that for me, but feel free to take it as a criticism, if you want.

Ch'en:
Glad to see you still have the strength to joke.

Lin Yühsia:
The daughter of the Rat King doesn't have to be the Rat King, but it doesn't mean she can't be.

Lin Yühsia:
She could be a different sort of Rat King.

Lin Yühsia:
This time, I made my own choice.

Lin Yühsia:
There are slums in Lungmen, but there shouldn't be. It's a job that someone has to do, no matter how many years go by.

Lin Yühsia:
The times are changing, but no one should be left behind.

Ch'en:
I believe that, when it's you saying it.

Ch'en:
By the way...

Lin Yühsia:
What is it? Your turn to hem and haw?

Ch'en:
Have you seen Wei Yenwu these past few days?

Wei Yenwu:
Are you leaving, Grandmaster?

Chongyue:
Yes.

Chongyue:
Once I've handed over my duties.

Chongyue:
Speaking of which, I must thank you.

Wei Yenwu:
For what?

Chongyue:
You chose to trust Yumen.

Chongyue:
And you chose to trust my friends.

Wei Yenwu:
It's all water under the bridge.

Wei Yenwu:
We suffered some losses, but we should count ourselves fortunate that the situation remained under control.

Chongyue:
More importantly, I saw how the people here remain united, even after so many years.

Chongyue:
Yumen hasn't changed. Man will triumph over Heaven.

Chongyue:
Now I can be at ease about leaving.

Wei Yenwu:
......

Wei Yenwu:
There's no telling when we'll meet again.

Wei Yenwu:
Take care, Grandmaster.

Chongyue:
You too. Beware the intrigue of the court.

Wei Yenwu:
I will.

Wei Yenwu:
By the way, you said something about Ch'en's swordsmanship yesterday.

Wei Yenwu:
'Skillful, but not yet the peak of perfection.'

Chongyue:
Yes, I remember.

Wei Yenwu:
Ch'en has talent, but she only just started learning the Chi Xiao style recently.

Wei Yenwu:
She has not mastered its true essence.

Chongyue:
Ah, you wanted to show off your skills.

Wei Yenwu:
I said before that Cloud-splitting sword is not actually Chi Xiao's ultimate move.

His fingers are his sword.

A light breeze begins blowing out of nowhere, creating tiny ripples in the teacup.

Wei Yenwu:
The ultimate move of Chi Xiao, Heaven's Eye.

Chongyue:
The form?

Wei Yenwu:
The eye of Heaven sees all and nothing.

Chongyue:
The concept?

Wei Yenwu:
Only when the clouds are parted is Heaven's wrathful eye revealed.

Wei Yenwu:
One must free one's mind to learn the form.

Chongyue:
The obstacle?

Wei Yenwu:
Let your heart guide the sword, never looking back.

Wei Yenwu:
Turn around, and the sword loses its sharpness, harming the user.

Wei Yenwu:
Farewell.

The breeze continues to blow, long after the chair is empty.

The man gazes into the ripples in the teacup, until a smile appears on his face.

Chongyue:
I have never seen the likes of it.

Grand Tutor:
Come in.

Shadow Guard:
Grand Tutor.

Grand Tutor:
You understand that entering Yumen without permission is enough to carry the suspicion of treason on its own?

Shadow Guard:
Yes.

Shadow Guard:
Lord Wei was attacked, and trapped in Yumen, while Yumen travels towards the capital...

Shadow Guard:
We were concerned for Lord Wei's safety. The urgency of the situation did not allow for deliberation.

Shadow Guard:
We have nothing but our lives to repay Lord Wei's kindness.

Grand Tutor:
Did Wei Yenwu tell you to look for him in Yumen if he did not return in three days?

Shadow Guard:
That is so.

Grand Tutor:
I can tell you now that both the assassination attempt on Wei Yenwu and the crisis at Yumen were accidents. There is no need to worry.

Shadow Guard:
I understand.

Grand Tutor:
Where were you when the Catastrophe happened?

Shadow Guard:
We operated in secret, eliminating insurgents stealthily.

Grand Tutor:
At least you did one thing you were supposed to.

Grand Tutor:
You may go.

Shadow Guard:
We are not subject to the Grand Tutor's punishment?

Grand Tutor:
As far as the Imperial Guard is concerned, all of you are already dead.

Grand Tutor:
I never saw you today.

Shadow Guard:
Yes, Grand Tutor.

Wei Yenwu:
You knew.

Grand Tutor:
From the beginning.

Grand Tutor:
And you never had any intention of hiding it from me.

Wei Yenwu:
Do you not reproach me for overstepping my boundaries?

Grand Tutor:
The situation remained under control thanks to the young envoy that you brought from Lungmen.

Wei Yenwu:
The Grand Commandant will soon learn of this incident.

Grand Tutor:
'Soon' is not the word I would use.

Wei Yenwu:
This is why I came to Yumen.

Wei Yenwu:
There is no consensus on how we should deal with the bestial Sui, whether we should prepare for war, or reconciliation. It is hard to see the forest when one is amongst the trees.

Wei Yenwu:
The minds of some of the parties concerned may no longer be on finding the right answer.

Grand Tutor:
You wanted to help the Lord Exorcist eliminate the insurgents out of a sense of duty to Yan.

Grand Tutor:
As long as you don't lose sight of it, you won't need me to tell you what to do.

Wei Yenwu:
I will remember your teachings.

Grand Tutor:
You have always been a good student.

Grand Tutor:
I remember when I taught you and your brother. You were always the quicker learner.

Wei Yenwu:
......

Chongyue:
Are you injured?

Qiubai:
Just a scratch.

Chongyue:
The Tumu Tianshi say it was you who protected the sand sluices.

Qiubai:
I let them get away, though.

Qiubai:
By the way, I came to say goodbye.

Chongyue:
...Alright.

Qiubai:
I will find a place where this sword will realize its potential, even if you're not with me anymore.

Chongyue:
I have no doubt you will succeed.

Qiubai:
There is no more hatred between us, but I haven't given up on surpassing you.

Qiubai:
I'll come and find you, when I feel ready.

Chongyue:
Like I said, anytime you feel ready.

Qiubai:
See you again.

Ling:
No regrets?

Chongyue:
What regrets?

Ling:
Who will she seek if one day It wakes from Its dream, and you and I return to the void?

Chongyue:
She managed to let go of her obsession with vengeance at her age. She will let another one go when I'm gone, and forgotten from her mind.

Chongyue:
Then the sky is the limit for her on the path of kung fu.

Ling:
Well, you <i>are</i> the Grandmaster. You're the authority on kung fu.

Chongyue:
Speaking of which, I think you just gave birth to a new legend when you single-handedly turned away the Catastrophe on the walls.

Ling:
I was drunk. I have no memory of those events.

Ling:
When you sober up, raise another flask. Where will you be going?

Chongyue:
Where Nian and Dusk went.

Observer:
The man has been playing against himself the whole afternoon, not speaking or inviting anyone to play against him.

Observer:
His moves are brilliant, but eccentric. There were a few that confused me.

Observer:
Some Go grandmaster I've never heard of? But why would he come to a place like Yumen?

Chongyue:
Oh?

A man faces a Go board outside a parlor. He is not playing against a manual; he thinks for a long time before each move, as though locked in a struggle against himself.

Black and white pieces intertwine on the rough wooden board, setting into motion a dazzling battle.

Go Player:
Do you know Go?

Chongyue:
A little.

Go Player:
What do you think about the board?

Chongyue:
The battle has been decided in three places. The balance of power is roughly even.

Chongyue:
But white pieces occupy a large area in the center, with no isolated pieces. It seems inevitable that black will lose by half a point...

Go Player?:
Look again.

Go Player?:
I've taught you.

Chongyue:
There is one ko left in the corner.

Chongyue:
Keep the ploy and take the last area.

Unfamiliar Voice:
White is spread out, with more to protect... therefore, more ammunition for my ko.

Unfamiliar Voice:
The match is not over.

Chongyue:
You won't give up. You'll go on until a winner has been determined.

Unfamiliar Voice:
The Go game doesn't matter. I'm playing against me, in order to determine a winner.

Unfamiliar Voice:
Your sword taught me a few things. This game state is my gift to you.

Chongyue:
I knew you had pieces around me.

Chongyue:
I just didn't know you had already lost faith in humanity then.

Unfamiliar Voice:
Man and beast are different.

Unfamiliar Voice:
You sealed yourself in the sword in exchange for a human body. You treated yourself as one of them. What became of you in the end?

Unfamiliar Voice:
All your friends are gone. You wander afar, alone. No one trusts you, no one knows.

Chongyue:
......

Unfamiliar Voice:
It's not that you don't know the hearts of man. No, you know it all too well. For centuries, you have always been the one most connected to them. How would you not know?

Unfamiliar Voice:
You could not blend in because you know that the hearts of man are unpredictable. You will always be an outsider.

Chongyue:
All the things you've done since Jie disappeared, you did to find someone to talk to.

Unfamiliar Voice:
We've been lonely for far too long. We want to find someone to talk to.

Chongyue:
We've fought for so many years. How ironic that we would end up knowing each other best.

Unfamiliar Voice:
You were never my enemy.

Unfamiliar Voice:
Never once did I consider you my enemy... even if it was you who stopped me then.

Chongyue:
I'll stop you again, if you drag people into your Go game.

Unfamiliar Voice:
Of course you will. Assuming, of course, that you can see the board.

Unfamiliar Voice:
We'll meet again.

Unfamiliar Voice:
Farewell, brother.

Chongyue:
......

Chongyue picks up a white piece and puts it down in a corner.

Slap.

An orthodox, classic move.

Record Keeper:
General.

Zuo Xuanliao:
This is...

Record Keeper:
The Grandmaster planned to write the Book of Kung Fu twenty years ago, but the responsibilities of Yumen kept him busy.

Record Keeper:
Work finally began on it five years ago, with the Grandmaster dictating it to me. I finally finished editing it yesterday.

Record Keeper:
It is a record of the Grandmaster's observations and interpretations of all kung fu under Heaven, every school and branch known to man.

Record Keeper:
Grandmaster wants you to have it.

Record Keeper:
Grandmaster says that there is much in common between kung fu and medicine. He has included some instructions in the appendix, which he hopes will improve your health.

Zuo Xuanliao:
......

Zuo Xuanliao:
Where is the Grandmaster?

Record Keeper:
He left Yumen an hour ago.

Record Keeper:
He says he has already sent away the 'guest', and you will be able to focus on dealing with things after the disaster.

Record Keeper:
He regrets not saying goodbye in person.

Zuo Xuanliao:
......

Zuo Xuanliao:
I see.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Why didn't you go with him?

Record Keeper:
I've been with the Grandmaster since he saved my life ten years ago. I began helping him record the martial arts of the world when I grew up, meeting many great heroes along the way.

Record Keeper:
The Grandmaster says that all I need to do is to study all that I've seen and heard during these years, if I wish to pursue the martial arts.

Record Keeper:
And if I do not wish to do so, I should go and find something I want to do, now that the Book of Kung Fu is complete.

Record Keeper:
'Life is a long journey.'

Zuo Xuanliao:
......

Zuo Xuanliao:
He has always been like this.

The more whimsical encounters there are, the more ties one needs to let go of.

Man values formality, beasts value empathy.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
Rescue and relief efforts have begun, sir.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Very well.

Zuo Xuanliao:
...The sun is setting.

Zuo Xuanliao:
Oh, the Wangfeng Festival...

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
Yesterday was the last day, but the beacon-lighting ceremony was suspended because of the Catastrophe.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
Would you like to resume it?

Zuo Xuanliao:
Of course.

The wizened general gazes beyond the city and sees nothing but sand.

Zuo Xuanliao:
I will beat the drum myself.

Patrol Battalion Soldier:
Sir, you've been in the tower all day. You should rest. We'll take care of it.

Zuo Xuanliao:
The journey is long. Someone should see him off.

All your companions have returned. Where do you fly off to, alone?

The drumbeats begin.

They are heavy, ringing clear and far.

Seventeen beats of the drum, representing the trials and tribulations that befell Yumen the past year, both big and small.

The Catastrophe has passed. The storm has swept away the many colors in the sky.

The clouds burn bright red, scorched by the setting sun.

He walks forward, the wind and sand slowly wiping away his footprints. The great city of Yumen grows smaller in the distance.

Thump—

Eighteen.

He stops briefly, but does not turn.

The eighteenth beat of the drum, symbolizing yet another Catastrophe survived by Yumen.

And...

Chongyue:
I'll be going.

Anxious Shanhaizhong Member:
We made it out.

Anxious Shanhaizhong Member:
Thank you for digging up the Patrol Battalion's activities, or we would have been goners inside.

Calm Shanhaizhong Member:
We got a message by Di beast. Boss and the others have set out for the next location. We should hurry and meet up with them.

Calm Shanhaizhong Member:
(Grinds teeth)

Calm Shanhaizhong Member:
Yumen... next time...

Anxious Shanhaizhong Member:
Hey, isn't that the one who...?

Calm Shanhaizhong Member:
You followed us?

Qiubai:
Followed? I just stopped to take a break on my way out of Yumen.

Qiubai:
But I guess fate meant for us to meet again.

Calm Shanhaizhong Member:
......

Anxious Shanhaizhong Member:
......

Qiubai:
Perfect. I'll send you on your way.

Qiubai:
And then I'll be on mine.
