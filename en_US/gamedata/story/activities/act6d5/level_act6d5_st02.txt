Act Two

Greetings

Silent Reunion Member:
........

L.G.D. Officer:
Drop your weapons and step back.

Silent Reunion Member:
........

L.G.D. Officer:
I said now!

L.G.D. Officer:
These guys aren't even human. No need to show mercy!

L.G.D. Officer:
Do you copy? All targets in Sector 7 are confirmed to be 'Terracotta'!

L.G.D. Officer:
Are they really Reunion?

Wei Fumizuki:
It's a diversion. Confirm their identity first.

L.G.D. Officer:
Chief Wei! The situation has changed!

L.G.D. Officer:
There's... there's more of them. Almost every squad on patrol has spotted Reunion elements!

L.G.D. Officer A:
A- another report of a brief spike in temperature in some areas of the city. What are the monitors doing?!

L.G.D. Officer B:
No reaction! But looking at the other numbers everything does seem normal...!

L.G.D. Officer A:
The enemy attacked as soon as our squad approached. They did not respond to any hails. We are unable to establish communication.

L.G.D. Officer B:
The enemy is scattered! They're weak, resistance is low, but there's lots of them!

L.G.D. Officer A:
Is this really Reunion?

L.G.D. Officer B:
The heat source is shifting. Find a way to track it!

L.G.D. Officer A:
There are no breaches in the city's defenses, they couldn't have gotten in——

Wei Fumizuki:
Don't panic!

Wei Fumizuki:
......

Wei Fumizuki:
Summon even-numbered formations. Worst case scenario, engage the enemy in the city. Give priority to evacuating civilians.

Wei Fumizuki:
The downtown area is densely populated, especially Temple Street. Have all police officers within that district focus on evacuations.

Wei Fumizuki:
Contact the satellite cities to check if there are any breaches in the defensive lines, confirm the enemy's means of ingress, and hold firm.

Wei Fumizuki:
Reunion should be long gone. We need to identify the enemy. Getting control of the situation is our main task. This is not the first time Lungmen has suffered an abnormal occurrence at New Year's. No need to panic.

Wei Fumizuki:
Stand together. The L.G.D. has nothing to fear.

L.G.D. Officer:
Right!

Wei Fumizuki:
........

Wei Fumizuki:
Apologies, Amiya, Doctor. While you have only just arrived here in Lungmen, we have no time to offer you our hospitality.

Amiya:
Don't worry. Our agreement has been in effect since the moment Rhodes Island moored.

Amiya:
Please leave it to us. We'll assist the L.G.D.!

Terracotta:
........

Terracotta:
........

Lungmen Citizen A:
W- what's with those things?

Lungmen Citizen A:
They look familiar, but weren't they——?!

Lungmen Citizen B:
Aiee! Over here too!

Terracotta:
........

Ch'en:
Hey, get out of the way...!

Lungmen Citizen A:
Th- thanks!

Ch'en:
Don't just stand there! Listen to the announcements and go to your designated evacuation zones!

Ch'en:
Keep to the main streets until you find the police. Hurry!

Lungmen Citizen B:
R- right!

Ch'en:
........

Ch'en:
They don't talk. They don't bleed. It's like cutting into a sea sponge. Even their bodies disappear.

Ch'en:
'Terracotta.' A fitting name.

Wei Fumizuki:
Calling them 'Reunion' would cause unnecessary panic, Officer Ch'en. They are not flesh and blood people.

Ch'en:
Understood. Urban districts secured.

Wei Fumizuki:
Thank you for your efforts. Unfortunately, simply killing the enemy seems futile.

Wei Fumizuki:
We've been unable to discern the true nature of the 'Terracottas,' but their strength has continued to grow over the past few hours.

Ch'en:
It's hard to imagine at this scale, but could it be some kind of Arts?

Wei Fumizuki:
That's what's most troubling, our Originium reaction monitors are still unresponsive. But that proves this cannot be Reunion.

Ch'en:
...I'm absolutely sure of that.

Ch'en:
It's a disguise, just an illusion.

Ch'en:
But this image of Reunion strutting down the streets of Lungmen...

Ch'en:
It's... disturbing.

Wei Fumizuki:
They are completely insulated against Originium. We had thought this impossible.

Ch'en:
But it's happening. How did they infiltrate Lungmen?

Wei Fumizuki:
Our conventional methods have failed. We have no indication of how the enemy 'appeared.'

Wei Fumizuki:
It is as if they've been here all along, standing in silent ranks. Charging, routing, and charging again.

Ch'en:
...Just like the tide.

Ch'en:
I'll prepare our defense in accordance with the contingency plan.

Wei Fumizuki:
Be careful.

Wei Fumizuki:
The L.G.D. can't afford to lose you.

Terracotta:
——

Ch'en:
Whoever their master is, they're just creating illusions. Other than causing a little chaos, is there any real threat to Lungmen?

Ch'en:
They go down in one hit.

Terracotta:
........

L.G.D. Officer:
(These things are freaking me out.... If we don't move, they just stand there in those perfectly straight rows?)

L.G.D. Officer:
(But they'll come rushing as soon as we pop our heads out.)

L.G.D. Officer:
(Keep your voice down. They're very weak. Let's hurry up and find a way to get the jump on them.)

L.G.D. Officer:
(——Wait, what are you doing?!)

L.G.D. Officer?:
........

L.G.D. Officer:
Hey, what are guys doing? Get back here!

L.G.D. Officer:
——No! You're not with us! Who are you?!

L.G.D. Officer?:
........

L.G.D. Officer:
When did these things get in here?!

L.G.D. Officer:
Wh- what's with your face under your helmet?

L.G.D. Officer:
Why, what the hell are you?! Get away from me!

L.G.D. Officer?:
........

Madame Oni:
What's all the ruckus? The L.G.D. freaking out just 'cause they ran into an enemy that looks like them?

Madame Oni:
Get up!

L.G.D. Officer:
R- right! I'm so sorry!

L.G.D. Officer:
...Wait, you're not Ch'en Sir. Who are you to give me orders?

Madame Oni:
Just roll with it.

Madame Oni:
Where is Ch'en Sir?

L.G.D. Officer:
She's is organizing a defensive line for the urban districts. She's going to block off the enemy and wipe them all out.

Madame Oni:
These things just popped out of nowhere. What makes her think that this would be the way to get rid of them all?

L.G.D. Officer:
This is what Chief Wei determined.

Madame Oni:
How am I supposed to trust your judgment when you're so on edge you're slipping up left and right?

L.G.D. Officer:
........

Madame Oni:
Ugh, I'm still dizzy.... Hey! One last question!

L.G.D. Officer:
I have no obligation to answer to the general public. The L.G.D. is here to follow Chief Wei's orders.

Madame Oni:
I just wanna ask, is the L.G.D. out there rumbling with people from Ursus, or like Yan folk from Jiangqi? Maybe some other heavy drinkers I'm forgetting?

Madame Oni:
Or are you guys running around with hooch in those canteens instead of water?

L.G.D. Officer:
Uh.... I can't really answer that, and I really don't know....

Madame Oni:
Ugh. I'm just trying to live down the shame of a certain Ch'en drinking me under the table.

Madame Oni:
Pull yourself together! Do some stretches!

L.G.D. Officer:
We don't want the general public involved...

Terracotta:
————

Madame Oni:
Gah, my head... Gotta sober up... What did you just say?

L.G.D. Officer:
Erm. I said, well... I guess there's no need to turn down help from upstanding citizens....

L.G.D. Officer A:
We lost the heat source. Can't our instruments trace it?

L.G.D. Officer B:
No, no, no! Conventional monitoring doesn't work. It only uses temperature to determine a rough location, and with severe lag!

L.G.D. Officer A:
Receiving reports from all squads, the enemy appeared out of nowhere in the city. Still no trace of Originium Arts!

L.G.D. Officer B:
Let's rout them like we did before...

L.G.D. Officer A:
C- contact. The Terracottas are changing again, they—— they——

Wei Fumizuki:
...What happened?

L.G.D. Officer A:
Chief Wei! They've started learning to use weapons and, more importantly, contact with the enemy reveals unique traits in each individual....

L.G.D. Officer A:
It's as if they're really living people——

L.G.D. Officer B:
Impossible! Who could make such a realistic illusion? There must be a caster! Send out a scout team to find them!

L.G.D. Officer A:
They've taken out our equipment! You still think they're fake? They're not illusions, they're real!

L.G.D. Officer B:
But..... But this.... It doesn't make any sense at all!

Wei Fumizuki:
......Thank you for the kind words, but you need not trouble yourself.

Wei Fumizuki:
You've dispatched Rhodes Island's operators to assist the L.G.D. in securing the urban districts, and that is the greatest of help to us.

Snowsant:
Is Chief Wei here——? Ahem!

Snowsant:
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to...! You, you're....

Wei Fumizuki:
The leader of our partner organization, Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals. I believe we can put it that way for now. 'Doctor' is the appropriate form of address.

Snowsant:
S-s-s-s-so sorry, Doctor! And Chief Wei, what's going on outside?

L.G.D. Officer:
All information on the 'Terracottas' has been disseminated to all members of the L.G.D. through the terminal.

Snowsant:
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot there was such a thing...

Snowsant:
——

Snowsant:
It- it still isn't finding that heat source? This is very strange....

L.G.D. Officer:
Uh oh.... Temperatures rising throughout Lungmen. We can't use thermal imaging. None of our instruments can detect the heat source itself——

L.G.D. Officer:
We can't confirm that the 'Terracottas' are directly connected to the heat source. And it is likely that the defensive line will collapse if we reallocate manpower.

Snowsant:
Um....

Snowsant:
Wouldn't it be better to look at it the other way around?

L.G.D. Officer:
What?

Snowsant:
Like, what if we took all the Originium-powered equipment in the city and turned it to max, then look for wherever we *don't* detect an Originium reaction...?

L.G.D. Officer:
........

Snowsant:
S- sorry, I was out of line. This isn't really my wheelhouse....

L.G.D. Officer A:
No... That's just crazy enough to work! Hey, how much equipment does the L.G.D. have the authority to deploy directly?

L.G.D. Officer B:
It's a lot more if you include civilian ones.

L.G.D. Officer A:
But if we have to overload everything, all of Lungmen will be paralyzed by the time we find the heat source...

Snowsant:
Paralyzed...? What kind of damages are we talking about?

L.G.D. Officer:
I don't know. Tens of millions?

Snowsant:
——

Snowsant:
Maybe we'd b-b-b-better not do it...

Wei Fumizuki:
No. Just do it.

Wei Fumizuki:
Nian sightings have become less and less common since the development of nomadic city technology. We have not had the opportunity to study the 'Nian'.

Wei Fumizuki:
The L.G.D. will do whatever it takes to uncover the secret of the 'Nian,' even if it's just the tip of the iceberg.

Wei Fumizuki:
I trust Snowsant's judgment.

Snowsant:
Thanks, but, but shouldn't we make careful projections before....

L.G.D. Officer A:
——! Sector 4's line has been breached! I can't raise the team leader!

L.G.D. Officer A:
Other lines have engaged! There are too many enemies!

Wei Fumizuki:
........

L.G.D. Comms Officer:
All teams, keep the airwaves clear at all times. Repeat, all teams, keep the waves clear!

L.G.D. Comms Officer:
Dynamic codes will be sent to team leaders every ten minutes! Use these to identify yourselves!

Frivolous L.G.D. Officer:
Damn it, if it's not one thing it's another.

Serious L.G.D. Officer:
Stop complaining! The rest of you, form up! Get the wounded back. Don't let them break through that barricade!

Terracotta:
——

Frivolous L.G.D. Officer:
Ugh, that really brings back some bad memories.

Serious L.G.D. Officer:
They're getting tougher. But they're no Reunion. And we beat Reunion.

Serious L.G.D. Officer:
Regroup!

Terracotta:
——

Frivolous L.G.D. Officer:
No... You- You...

Frivolous L.G.D. Officer:
You're..... you're supposed to be dead....

Serious L.G.D. Officer:
That's a fake, you moron! It's not that Infected. Come on!

Terracotta:
——

Frivolous L.G.D. Officer:
C- Captain!

Serious L.G.D. Officer:
Don't be *Lungmen profanity* stupid. They're all fakes! All of them!

Frivolous L.G.D. Officer:
I know, I know, I know! But to see them again, all of a sudden like this, I——

Serious L.G.D. Officer:
You again?! I just killed you a second ago!

Frivolous L.G.D. Officer:
Uh...?

Serious L.G.D. Officer:
None of you have any issues to work out with your colleagues? This is a great opportunity! Dig in your heels and give 'em hell!

Serious L.G.D. Officer:
This is as far back as we go. Are you going to let them into L.G.D. HQ?!

Frivolous L.G.D. Officer:
Yes!

Lungmen Guard Department

L.G.D. Officer:
Chief Wei! We've found an anomalous area on thermal imaging.

L.G.D. Officer:
We've got a lock on the heat source! It worked!

L.G.D. Officer:
But we're out of time... Some of the targets have breached our defensive lines!

L.G.D. Officer:
Re- report! We're getting distress signals from multiple teams!

Wei Fumizuki:
Where's Officer Ch'en?

L.G.D. Officer:
Officer Ch'en met up with Rhodes Island operator Amiya and are currently engaging the enemy approaching the L.G.D.!

L.G.D. Officer:
...Chief Wei?

Wei Fumizuki:
Lungmen trusts the Doctor's abilities, and since Rhodes Island operators have joined the fight, the Doctor should enjoy command authority equal to that of Officer Ch'en.

Wei Fumizuki:
We'll leave it to the Doctor.

L.G.D. Officer:
The enemy moving outside the containment zones will harm the civilian population, we have to——

L.G.D. Officer:
Wait, we've picked up a strong Originium reaction.... a sandstorm? This, this is——

L.G.D. Officer:
Special transmission incoming! It- it's Inspector Lin!

L.G.D. Officer:
Hasn't Old Lin been retired for seven or eight years?! What's he saying?

L.G.D. Officer:
He- he said he tossed all the enemies who slipped out of containment into a dumpster...

L.G.D. Officer:
And, he still has a message for Chief Wei....

Wei Fumizuki:
...Officer Lin is a hero of the L.G.D. and we should respect his opinion.

L.G.D. Officer:
Yes!

Retiree:
Big Wei, how are the greenhorns? Is this how they're doing things? Why not make a special dispensation, throw me and Little Wei into the ring and I promise we'll have this done in under ten minutes..

L.G.D. Officer:
........

Wei Fumizuki:
........

L.G.D. Officer:
........Chief Wei?

Wei Fumizuki:
........Heh, I miss those days, when we were all young.

Wei Fumizuki:
But the L.G.D. hasn't fallen so far that we need to rely on those two. Contact Officer Ch'en, and let us trouble the Doctor to command the Rhodes Island operators.

Wei Fumizuki:
Time to fight back.

Retiree:
I told you the New Year's couplets you wrote were inauspicious. Just now I saw several faces who should not be alive.

Mr. Wei, Ordinary Citizen:
That's my fault now? And how many times have I told you not to use those old pet names in front of the men?

Retiree:
Who is it who wears the pants around here?

Mr. Wei, Ordinary Citizen:
........

Retiree:
Right. That's why *she's* Big Wei.

Mr. Wei, Ordinary Citizen:
Whatever. So what do we do now?

Retiree:
Well, I never thought I'd live to see another Nian.

Mr. Wei, Ordinary Citizen:
Reminiscing about our days on the force?

Retiree:
No. And my daughter isn't even home. There's no point in heading back there.

Retiree:
Let's see what they've got in store this time around. No matter who we've become, our duty to protect the people hasn't changed.

L.G.D. Officer:
...Nng... I can't feel my arms... Shit...

L.G.D. Officer:
These things, why do I feel like they're getting stronger....?

Terracotta:
——

L.G.D. Officer:
What?

Ally of Justice #1:
What's going on? Why are these people charging us without so much as a word?

Back-Alley Doctor:
I think you've got it a bit twisted, Waai Fu. I'm afraid these aren't quite 'people,' you know?

Back-Alley Doctor:
They're more like ghosts, or something?

Ally of Justice #1:
G- ghosts or whatever wouldn't go down this easy, would they?

Full-time Security Guard:
Legend has it that as the New Year approaches, all kinds of monsters will come out to plague the people. Could be something like that.

Ally of Justice #1:
Monsters can be seen and touched! Ghosts can't!

Full-time Security Guard:
You say that, but he vanished right as you kicked him...

Ally of Justice #1:
........

Back-Alley Doctor:
Huh? Where are you pulling us all of a sudden? And you're looking kind of stiff, Waai Fu.

Ally of Justice #1:
Take heart.

L.G.D. Officer:
You civilians should be in your designated evacuation zone. It isn't safe here!

Back-Alley Doctor:
You're hurt, Ah Sir. Your right arm is broken and you've lost a lot of blood. It's at least an hour and a half walk from here to the L.G.D. Can you handle it?

L.G.D. Officer:
Ugh.... I'm fine....

Full-time Security Guard:
Aak, you better not...

Back-Alley Doctor:
If I might speak freely, I come from a long line of doctors. And since childhood I have taken it upon myself to save lives and care for the wounded. Whenever I encounter some excitement on the street, I always rush to see if I can be of aid——

L.G.D. Officer:
W- what are you doing?

Back-Alley Doctor:
——Stopping your bleeding, dressing the wound, applying anaesthetic, giving you a whole new lease on life.

Full-time Security Guard:
That last one sounds a bit overboard.

Back-Alley Doctor:
It's under control. Come now, Ah Sir, how often do you get a shot at free health care?

L.G.D. Officer:
I really appreciate it, but there's something off about y——OW! Hands off! Hey!

L.G.D. Officer:
What was that drug? Are you licensed? Show me your papers, or else——

L.G.D. Officer:
——Ah.

L.G.D. Officer:
Heh, heh? The pain's actually gone...?

L.G.D. Officer:
And what's that fruity smell....?

Back-Alley Doctor:
The new stuff is watermelon flavored. Congratulations on being the first to try it!

Full-time Security Guard:
Why would you have watermelon flavored injections?

Back-Alley Doctor:
Honestly, the pain relief is just a placebo effect. Your bleeding has stopped, and you'll certainly have no trouble returning to the L.G.D. in one piece.

Back-Alley Doctor:
Once there, do remember to get formal medical treatment, as a simple debridement will not solve the problem, and there is no way to know what substance caused the wound.

Full-time Security Guard:
........Did you just admit you're informal?

Back-Alley Doctor:
This is an emergency!

Back-Alley Doctor:
Let's get you up, Ah Sir. You're all right.

Watermelon-scented L.G.D. Officer:
I really do feel all right...

Watermelon-scented L.G.D. Officer:
Thank you very much, and I'll report this assistance to my superiors when the battle is over!

Back-Alley Doctor:
No, no, no, let's not go reporting things. Safe travels, Ah Sir. Take care!

Watermelon-scented L.G.D. Officer:
...What a weirdo.

Back-Alley Doctor:
Whew! And that's my good deed for the day!

Back-Alley Doctor:
Experimental Epinephrine Reagent No. 3.... Effective..... No short-term adverse effects.... Continuous observation.... Smells of watermelon, origin unknown.... And that's that!

Ally of Justice #1:
Origin unknown?

Back-Alley Doctor:
Tried it, it worked, it didn't kill anyone, that's what I call good medicine!

Ally of Justice #1:
Good thing it worked, or we'd have to knock you out and hand you over to the L.G.D. to calm things down.

Full-time Security Guard:
Those ghosts are making trouble all over the place. Is that why Mr. Lee had us out on the street all of a sudden?

Ally of Justice #1:
I definitely don't want to give up the streets to them, but if it's g-g-g-ghosts.... What can you do? You can't punch or kick them.

Back-Alley Doctor:
But you just——

Ally of Justice #1:
You can't fight a ghost with your fists! It can't be done! No way! I can't do it!

Back-Alley Doctor:
You were doing that literally two minutes ago...

Back-Alley Doctor:
Well, I've been short of work lately, so why not just leave them to make some patients?

Back-Alley Doctor:
Like a bicycle repairman who leaves nails out on the street.

Full-time Security Guard:
Keep going down the path of wickedness and you'll get what's coming to you.

Back-Alley Doctor:
I'm not worried. I know far too many happy, healthy people who've earned a comeuppance. My turn is a long way off.

Back-Alley Doctor:
By the way, Hung, aren't you curious about the 'Nian'?

Full-time Security Guard:
I just want everyone to be safe and sound.

Back-Alley Doctor:
You're! So! Dull! What about Waai Fu? Want to sneak into the containment zone and take a look?

Ally of Justice #1:
I won't stop you, but I'll tell Mr. Lee all about it.

Back-Alley Doctor:
Don't you want to go toe to toe with a literal legend? Bam! Pow! Bang! Uppercut! I've heard the Nian is a tough, bloodthirsty demon. One you can actually see and touch!

Back-Alley Doctor:
Ah. And if you defeat the Nian, your old man, in pursuit of the ultimate truth of martial arts, would finally be willing to fight you. And then, at long last, father and daughter communicate with their fists, reconciling once and for all! What a beautiful story....

Ally of Justice #1:
.................

Back-Alley Doctor:
Hey, Waai Fu, I was just kidding, don't be like that.... Wait, Waai Fu, where are you going...? Oh, no! Hung! Stop her!

Child:
——Mom?

Terracotta:
........

Child:
Mister.... Have you seen my mom?

Child:
Mister?

Terracotta:
........

Child:
——Mmh, hot!

Child:
Huh?

Child:
Lady, where did that man go?

???:
It's probably not a good idea to let a guy like that, silent and armed to the teeth, around kids, huh?

Child:
But Mom told me to find a policeman if I got lost...

???:
You don't have to do everything your mom says.

Child:
But...

???:
No buts, little one. We've got the battle of the century going on out here. You run along and play somewhere else.

Child:
Um, okay.... Thank you, lady!

???:
What a good kid.

???:
......

???:
......

???:
Hmmm...?

???:
Isn't a sweet little show like that supposed to make you think, 'Oh, maybe she's not so bad,' and lower the dagger?

???:
Is one woman supposed to be able to wear out the entire L.G.D.?

???:
I'm not one to mince words, so let's get right to it. You're no ordinary warrior. What's your name?

Lava:
Lava.

???:
What's with people these days? That can't be your name. It's too weird.

Lava:
It's my codename.

???:
That's kind of a pain. What's the difference between a name and a codename anyway? Is it really so important to express your identity as an independent organism?

Lava:
You're the one who asked!

Lava:
Besides, there's no way you could understand us, 'Nian'.

Nian:
Wow, you recognized me right away.

Nian:
That's what they used to call me, but I don't think 'Nian' is cool enough. Can we change it? I want a badass codename like 'Lava.'

Lava:
...You won't get away, the L.G.D. can track you.

Nian:
I don't have to run. Come, Tinmen.

Terracotta:
........

Lava:
This is the weapon you took from the Lungmen central database.

Lava:
What can you do with such weak illusions?

Nian:
Oooh - you cut through the air with a dagger? I've never seen Arts like that before. Pretty badass!

Lava:
Thanks for the compliment. Should I teach you?

Nian:
Ho ho ho——not bad.

Nian:
I didn't expect to see a massive moving metropolis. You people have some tricks up your sleeves.

Nian:
And your Arts, well, I've never seen such a skillful and practical approach before.

Nian:
It's a relief. I was afraid you wouldn't have made much progress.

Lava:
You used the data in those records to create illusions of Reunion and the L.G.D.

Lava:
Your power is not like Originium Arts, but you can't fool me. Now that I have you figured out, the monsters that have plagued Lungmen for centuries will be no more.

Nian:
You're a smart cookie. Where'd you come up with this stuff?

Lava:
I've been combing ancient records and modern papers in a quest to understand you.

Nian:
Huh? So all the years I've been sleeping, you've been cramming trivia about me?

Lava:
Pretty much.

Lava:
I was born and bred to hunt your kind.

Nian:
Wha? So you're like, a fan of mine?

Lava:
...If wanting to kill you counts.

Nian:
I never thought I'd meet someone like you.... before I forgot myself.

Nian:
Oh, honey, I'm touched. I'm on the verge of tears here. It's like I'm a forgotten has-been meeting an old fan. How about it? Why don't we call a truce and go get a drink?

Nian:
Since we're waiting for the Tinmen to overpower the... oh, what are they called again...? That's right! Since we're waiting for the Tinmen to beat down the L.G.D., we might as well find something to pass the time.

Lava:
...According to the records, it's been decades since you last attacked Lungmen.

Lava:
You have no idea what we're capable of now, and you're still so sure of yourself?

Nian:
What are you capable of? You've got taller buildings, a bit more metal in your machines, and your hot pot tastes worse...

Nian:
What should I be worrying about? What else can you show me?

Lava:
You seem to be looking forward to it.

Nian:
That I am.

Lava:
You'll see. Let's call it... divination.

Nian:
They're allowing divination these days? Time was, a commoner would be put to death for seeking knowledge of the heavens.

Lava:
If divination's a crime, then I'm guilty as charged.

Nian:
You....

Nian:
I'm even more curious about you. You sure you don't want that drink?

Lava:
Then make those things stop.

Nian:
Is this like a 'surrender now and I'll let you live' thing?

Lava:
I care more about the truth than fighting you.

Nian:
The truth? What do you want to know? Seeing as we're so in tune with each other, I might consider telling you.

Lava:
Your goal. And how to defeat all of you once and for all.

Nian:
All of us?

Lava:
Nian is only your name. The Catastrophe is far more than just you, I know that well.

Nian:
What are you going to do when you know the answer? Still going to be all fighty-killy?

Lava:
Yeah. Maybe. If your true form can actually be killed.

Nian:
........

Nian:
........

Nian:
........Ha.

Lava:
(There's a change in her attitude... A pressure in the air...)

Nian:
Hey, li'l Lava.

Lava:
Don't call me that. We're not friends.

Nian:
Don't say that, you really surprised me, you've learned a lot more than I ever expected.

Nian:
You're right, you know. At first, I wasn't planning to do anything to this city. As far as I was concerned, you were weak little folk, gradually making your way in the world.

Nian:
But I have to admit, you made some real progress over the years.

Nian:
And to think someone's actually been watching us all this time. That's a pleasant surprise.

Lava:
You left behind horror stories and monster myths in every corner of the world. How could we not look for you?

Lava:
Sometimes it was a giant, sometimes it was an army, sometimes it was Arts like a Catastrophe...

Lava:
But we always grew stronger, in order to survive.

Lava:
What I don't understand is how the people of ancient Yan fought with spears and halberds, while Lungmen today has huge cannons to protect the city, and in the end they all suffered the same fate?

Lava:
Were you going easy back then? Or are you stronger now?

Lava:
Or——

Nian:
You need juuust the right amount of destruction and mayhem to make a point.

Nian:
Isn't this fun? I wake up to find that the little ones who haven't changed in years are suddenly so close to the truth.

Nian:
So....

Nian:
I think it's time to take off the kid gloves and bump up the difficulty.

Lava:
You won't get away with it.

Nian:
Ooh, fire——?

Nian:
So the dagger was just an opening act. The staff is the headliner?

Nian:
You people have never been willing to use your power efficiently. And that's one thing that hasn't changed.

Lava:
A shield...?

Lava:
I've never seen anything like it before. And it's suppressing the range of my Originium Arts, how did she do that...?

Nian:
Hey! Originium Arts? That sounds pretty badass!

Lava:
(But my flames just now... She used her power specifically to block them?)

Lava:
(Spatial Arts are trickier.... but...)

Nian:
But I do have one teensy little question. How did you come up with all this stuff while I, or I guess 'we,' were snoozing away?

Lava:
No comment.

Nian:
Is that right?

Nian:
Let's change the subject then. A minute ago, you said my power was to use data to do up those toy soldiers.

Nian:
Sorry, but that's a swing and a miss. How could I figure out something so complicated so quickly?

Nian:
Turns out, you break stuff down into its simplest parts, language, Arts, anything, and it's all pretty much the same.

Nian:
And the best possible material I could find was that data. Your past enemies, your fears and anxieties. It's perfect for having a little fun.

Nian:
Think of it like blowing bubbles in the park.

Lava:
...What are you trying to say?

Nian:
When you said you had me figured out, I got this warm, tingly feeling.

Nian:
I wonder if it's true.

Lava:
You're...

Lava:
How... The top of that building... it's melting?

Nian:
Relax. All the people are gone.

Lava:
...What are you going to do?

Nian:
Smelt. Cast. Temper.

Nian:
This city will make the perfect forge.

Lava:
——!

Nian:
Li'l Lava, don't you think you'd make a good blacksmith?

Lava:
Who wants to be a blacksmith?!

Lava:
(Hrm, it's just like in those theses. They were so out there, I never thought they could be true. But the Nian can pull off some incredible feats without using Arts, in the traditional sense.)

Lava:
(Now, just like the conclusions of those papers... I have to try this.)

Nian:
Oh? The dagger slices through the air and compresses it. Is this how you use those Originium Arts?

Lava:
None of the records or studies give any indication of your true form. It took long enough to determine that you were actually a communal organism rather than a single individual.

Lava:
But that begs the question, why am I standing here?

Lava:
Cover your ears, Nian.

Nian:
Ugh.... That noise...!

Lava:
'The heart of the crucible is... nothing but straw!'

Nian:
Gah——That's——

Lava:
Never thought I'd see you cowering.

Nian:
Who the hell are you?! How do you know about that——

Nian:
Ahhhh.... No... I know all too well who's behind this...

Nian:
Shit. How much did Hsi tell the humans——

Lava:
Surprised?

Lava:
Countless researchers have spent countless years going over every record they could get their hands on, and still not one could find even a shred of hope to combat the Nian.

Lava:
But there are many ancient legends in the land of Yan, and the ones that don't concern you have interesting bits to them.

Nian:
Legends?

Lava:
Old folk sayings like 'the din of fireworks rings in the new year' and such.

Nian:
Ahhh....

Nian:
So that's how it is.

Nian:
I guess these things turn into legends to be passed down through the centuries, even if you don't understand their true meaning.

Nian:
In a world plagued by Catastrophe, you find a way to keep things going. Isn't that nice?

Nian:
I'll put a little more thought into it.... Let's build something a bit less boring.

Lava:
She closed her eyes?

Lava:
Wait, she's taking something out of her mouth... it's... a sword?

Nian:
Slow on the uptake. And don't distract me. What if I choke?

Lava:
The spatial Arts... you cut it open?

Nian:
Is that so surprising? Just cut right into it. You can't do that?

Nian:
*Sigh*. Never enough respect for the time-honored crafts. Always after some kind of boring old embroidered pillow or whatever.

Nian:
Then let's have you feel the weight of history.

Lava:
Guh!

Nian:
Oh, sorry. Was that too heavy for you? Hey! Are you still alive?

Lava:
So this is the power of the 'Nian,' huh? I'm not impressed.

Nian:
Come on, that was pretty hard, wasn't it? Don't try to act tough here.

Lava:
It's fine. I already know how to beat you. Aren't you at least a little shocked?

Lava:
If nothing else because I'm actually putting up a fight?

Nian:
...Ha. I think someone's getting too big for her tattered britches.

Lava:
——The ground, no, the world is shaking. Does this city mean anything to you?

Nian:
It's overkill, isn't it? Just to deal with you?

Nian:
I'm only trying to see the best you humans have come up with. And passing the time, I guess.

Nian:
How long can you keep fighting? Ten minutes? An hour? A whole day?

Lava:
Until I unravel the mystery of your trickery.

Nian:
You're dreaming! How can a simpleton like you perceive that which is beyond your world?

Lava:
She pointed to the sky...?

Nian:
'Heavenly forge, take the bounty of the earth and smelt an edge to slice the sky!'

Nian:
Arise!
