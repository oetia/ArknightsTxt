Medical Examination Room 6

Hibiscus:
Open.

Hibiscus:
Say 'aahh.'

???:
......

Hibiscus:
Say 'aahh.'

???:
Hmph.

Hibiscus:
Come on, open your mouth, please? I'm just checking your teeth. I promise I won't hurt you.

???:
......

Hibiscus:
Come on....

Hibiscus:
Don't make me pull out the big guns every time.

Hibiscus:
Hmph, I'll make you behave.

Hibiscus:
Hey!

Hibiscus:
Look, Miss Perro, what do I have here?

???:
？

Hibiscus:
It's your favorite, isn't it?

Hibiscus:
If you're a good girl and help me finish my exam....

Hibiscus:
These honey biscuits are all yours.

???:
(Sniffing)

???:
......

Hibiscus:
That's weird. Why isn't she reacting to the honey biscuits?

Lava:
There's something wrong with your recipe, Hibiscus.

Lava:
How many times have I told you not to put weird stuff in your food?

Lava:
You never listen.

Lava:
Here, little Perro, I'll give you this.

What?:
(Sniffing)

???:
Awoo.

Lava:
But you have to be a good girl.

???:
Mmmm——

???:
Awoo.

???:
Ah——

Hibiscus:
It worked!

Hibiscus:
That's my little Lava. So reliable.

Lava:
Too bad you're not.

Hibiscus:
Okay, let's proceed with the oral exam.

Hibiscus:
Swallow the crumbs, okay, and open wide...

Lava:
Hey, Hibiscus?

Hibiscus:
Watch your tongue, Miss Perro——Hm, what?

Lava:
Why did we bring her back with us?

Hibiscus:
Because we felt bad for her. Her infection is very serious.

Hibiscus:
And the head of the Leithanian branch even said:

Hibiscus:
'It's a good thing you subdued her. There would have been no hope for her if the police or bounty hunters found her first.'

Hibiscus:
An Infected person as far gone as her, with the way the laws in Leithanien have changed, almost certainly would have been euthanized.'

Hibiscus:
If it's at all possible, please at least get her out of Leithanien's territory. Thank you.'

Lava:
Even if she wasn't Infected, the way she was just attacking people on the road would probably not have ended well for her.

Lava:
At least twenty-four groups of travelers got attacked before us. She hurt nearly a hundred people.

Lava:
And that's just in Leithanien. Who knows what she did anywhere else.

Lava:
Not to mention her fighting skills. I don't think the five of us could've pulled off attacks like that.

Hibiscus:
But all she did was take some food. She was just hungry——Ow!

Lava:
She almost killed me!

Lava:
If Kroos wasn't looking out for me and Beagle wasn't so quick with her shield, this Perro would've crushed your little sister with that rock-covered javelin.

Hibiscus:
Miss Perro, please don't bite my hand!

???:
Waah.

Hibiscus:
Okay, okay.

Hibiscus:
Your teeth are almost finished. Just a little longer. Hang in there!

Hibiscus:
Yeah. Good girl.

Hibiscus:
Come on, Lava, don't be like that.

Lava:
Like what? I'm just stating facts.

Hibiscus:
What's with you all of a sudden? Getting pissy about every little thing.

Hibiscus:
I thought you loved Miss Perro?

Lava:
Yeah, she's great. She loves me too.

Lava:
That's why she threw all kinds of rocks and flames and ice and pretty much everything at me.

Lava:
How did she master so many different complex Arts anyway?

Lava:
Hey, little Perro. Are you sure you've never studied Originium Arts?

???:
Ooh?

Hibiscus:
Heyyy, I told you not to move——Lava, quit screwing around!

Lava:
I'm just asking...

Hibiscus:
LA——VA——!

Lava:
All right, all right. My bad. Whatever.

???:
Mmm?

Hibiscus:
Ah, sorry, Miss Perro, just a little longer.

Hibiscus:
And now here, and here.

Hibiscus:
........

Lava:
........

Hibiscus:
Whew. And that should be it.

Hibiscus:
Now, Miss Perro, we're pretty much done. Rinse your mouth with this glass of water, and be sure to spit it out. Don't swallow.

???:
Mmm.

???:
(Gulp.)

Hibiscus:
Little Lava.

Lava:
Huh?

Hibiscus:
Something's bothering you.

Lava:
None of your business.

Hibiscus:
You were the first one in the squad to give her something nice to eat.

Lava:
What's that got to do with anything?

Hibiscus:
After starving for that long, she shouldn't be consuming much sugar, from a nutritional standpoint. But she really needs to supplement pretty much everything at this point.

Hibiscus:
That's why...

Lava:
Wait....

Hibiscus:
You snuck off and bought a bunch of candy.

Hibiscus:
Only later realizing you'd spent all your money.

Lava:
That's enough...

Hibiscus:
Or when we were bringing Miss Perro back, everyone was worried she'd run off.

Hibiscus:
Only you were brave enough to try to communicate with her, building the trust we needed to take off her shackles.

Lava:
Ugh...

Hibiscus:
And once we learned she liked honey biscuits, it was you, among the five of us, who worked the hardest to make the best ones.

Lava:
Seriously, stop!

Hibiscus:
Your big sister is very proud of you.

Lava:
Come on, don't talk about this stuff in front of her!

Lava:
I- I just did what I had to do.

Hibiscus:
But it's so sweet. No need to hide it. Hehe.

Lava:
Oh yeah!

Hibiscus:
What?

Lava:
So, um, the, like, oral exam, that's the last part, right?

Hibiscus:
Yes.

Lava:
And then, um, what happens to her?

Hibiscus:
Well...

Hibiscus:
That's not up to us.

Hibiscus:
The operators responsible for that are still talking over her case. Orchid said she'd have someone tell us in the afternoon.

Hibiscus:
Anyway, after a busy morning and all those examinations, it's time to find a place for Miss Perro to——

Beagle:
Hibiscus, Lava! Are you still not done checking out Miss Perro? If we don't leave now, we'll miss Dobermann's training! I'm going on ahead!

Lava & Hibiscus:
Huh?

Lava:
Hibiscus?

Hibiscus:
Oh, what?

Lava:
I thought you said got us out of Dobermann's class!

Hibiscus:
Huh? Uh, well....

Hibiscus:
I, er, I might have forgot...

Lava:
Why didn't you say so earlier?

Hibiscus:
All I could think about at the time was helping Miss Perro with her checkup...

Lava:
We're dead.

Lava:
Let's go pick out a pair of coffins.

Lava:
What are we gonna do?!

Lava:
Okay, how about we take little Perro out now and give her to the first person who comes along? I just hope we can find them again after training.

Hibiscus:
That plan is a little...

Lava:
Let's see you come up with one!

Lava:
I'm not running laps around the bridge again.

Lava:
And I bet you don't want to memorize anatomy textbooks while doing jumping jacks either.

Hibiscus:
Who would?!

Hibiscus:
Okay, fine. We'll do it your way.

Lava:
I'll get her weapons. You deal with her.

Hibiscus:
B- but what about her mouthwash——

Lava:
She already swallowed it!

Lava:
Hurry!

Rhodes Island Landship

Outside Medical Examination Room 6

Lava:
(There's someone!)

Lava:
Blacksmith!

Vulcan:
Can I help you?

Lava:
Can you take care of this girl for a bit? We'll come get her right after training.

Vulcan:
What? Girl?

Hibiscus:
These honey biscuits are her favorite. If she gets cranky, just give Miss Perro one of these.

Vulcan:
Huh?

Lava:
And don't let her have her weapons just yet.

Lava & Hibiscus:
Thanks!

Lava:
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

???:
Wait!

Lava:
I'm sorry, Miss Perro. We'll be right back!

Lava:
Aahhh! Only three minutes! She's gonna kill us!

Lava:
......

???:
Wah...

Vulcan:
???

Vulcan:
So, what's your deal?

Vulcan:
......

???:
......

Vulcan:
Just take the biscuits. Eat them whenever.

???:
.......

Vulcan:
You want me to carry your weapons?

???:
(shakes head)

Vulcan:
Good.

Vulcan:
Come on. My workshop is this way.

Rhodes Island Landship

Vulcan's Workshop

Vulcan:
Come on in. Have a seat.

Vulcan:
If the forge gets too hot, you can go behind the partition.

???:
Thanks (quietly).

Vulcan:
Don't mention it.

???:
......

???:
Are you... a blacksmith?

Vulcan:
I'm Rhodes Island's blacksmith. Codename Vulcan.

???:
Vul... can...

???:
Vulcan...

???:
Vulcan... is... Minoan?

Vulcan:
Yes.

???:
Can Vulcan check my weapons for me?

Vulcan:
I am not authorized to perform maintenance on unregistered weapons.

Vulcan:
Sorry.

???:
Oh...

???:
Wahh...

Vulcan:
(Although, the weapon she's holding...)

Vulcan:
(It feels somewhat... familiar...)

Vulcan:
But there's no harm in just taking a look.

Vulcan:
Can I see that axe you're holding?

???:
！

???:
Yes!

???:
Here you go!

Vulcan:
Thanks.

Vulcan:
(This is definitely Minoan craftsmanship. Brings back memories.)

Vulcan:
(It's worn. It's been a while.)

Vulcan:
(But it's been wiped down surprisingly clean. You're doing what little maintenance you can, at least.)

Vulcan:
(The construction is solid. Doesn't look like it's too damaged. It would be like new after some basic touches.)

Vulcan:
(Oddly, no chipping, no warping of the blade. Pretty low temperature steel.)

Vulcan:
(The steel...)

Vulcan.:
(It's familiar... where have I seen smithing like this before...?)

Vulcan.:
(.......)

???:
Um, ma'am?

Vulcan:
(Ma'am?)

Vulcan:
(Whatever. She can call me that if she wants.)

???:
On the axe, near the grip,

???:
There's a word.

???:
It's my name!

???:
In Minoan!

???:
I wanted to go to Minos, but it's a long walk.

???:
No one I met could tell me my name. They could only tell me it's Minoan.

???:
Since Vulcan is a Minoan, you must know how to read it!

???:
Can you read it to me?

Vulcan:
Let's see here.

Vulcan:
(....)

Vulcan:
(Good thing, it hasn't completely rubbed away.)

Vulcan:
(These characters...)

Vulcan:
(They're definitely Minoan.)

Vulcan:
(In standard pronunciation, this would be...)

Vulcan:
(Ce... O... Be...)

Vulcan:
'Ceobe.'

Vulcan:
Should be Ceobe.

Ceobe:
Ce... O... Be...

Vulcan:
Ceobe.

Ceobe:
Ce... obe.

Ceobe:
Ceobe.

Ceobe:
I'm Ceobe!

Ceobe:
I've got a name!

Ceobe:
Hm...

Ceobe:
Vulcan, ma'am?

Vulcan:
(Ma'am... again...?)

Vulcan:
(Maybe I should give her a little nudge...)

Vulcan:
Wh- what?

Ceobe:
People usually have two names, don't they?

Ceobe:
Like Lava has a different name when her sister calls her.

Ceobe:
She's 'Little Lava,' or something.

Ceobe:
I want one of those.

Vulcan:
Sorry, I'm not very good at naming things...

Ceobe:
Vulcan is a blacksmith. Blacksmiths are good people. And good people are good at naming.

Vulcan:
(What is this logic?)

Vulcan:
(Whatever. She's just a kid.)

Vulcan:
Let me think for a moment.

Ceobe:
Yeah!

Vulcan:
(She wants a nickname?)

Vulcan:
(But I only know how to name weapons. What should I do?)

Vulcan:
(Ceobesius? Ceobenie? Ceobetia?)

Vulcan:
(No, no, no. She's not a weapon. I need another scheme.)

Vulcan:
(Think, Vulcan...)

Vulcan:
........

Ceobe:
Vulcan?

Vulcan:
(She mentioned 'Little Lava' before, didn't she?)

Vulcan:
........

Ceobe:
Are you okay, Vulcan?

Vulcan:
(Well, there's a pretty easy way out of this... might as well take it.)

Vulcan:
We'll call you 'Kay.'

Ceobe:
Kay?

Vulcan:
Yes.

Vulcan:
(It kinda sucks...)

Ceobe:
Kay... Ceobe...

Ceobe:
Thank you so much, Vulcan, ma'am!

Vulcan:
You're welcome.

Ceobe:
!

Vulcan:
?!

Vulcan:
Don't be scared, Kay, it's just someone looking for me. No bad guys here.

Vulcan:
Put down the weapon, okay?

Ceobe:
No bad guys?

Vulcan:
No bad guys.

Vulcan:
There's no bad guys at Rhodes Island.

Vulcan:
If you're scared, you can go behind the partition.

Ceobe:
Ceobe isn't scared of anything.

Vulcan:
Good.

Logistics Operator:
Vulcan, are you in?

Vulcan:
Who is it?

Logistics Operator:
Hello, Vulcan, I'm an operator with the logistics department. I've come to relay the decision regarding the little Perro girl who was brought to Rhodes Island yesterday.

Logistics Operator:
Operator Hibiscus said she entrusted the Perro girl to you. Is she still with you?

Vulcan:
Yes, come in.

Ceobe:
Vulcan!

Vulcan:
Don't worry, it's okay.

Logistics Operator:
Good day, operator Vulcan.

Logistics Operator:
Good day, little Perro girl.

Ceobe:
Don't call me Perro girl. My name is Ceobe.

Logistics Operator:
Oh?

Logistics Operator:
All right, Ceobe.

Logistics Operator:
Now then, we have been over the details surrounding your rescue, our determination is as follows. Please listen carefully.

Logistics Operator:
Due to the circumstances surrounding your arrival, your personal freedom had been temporarily restricted.

Logistics Operator:
We apologize for that. But from this point on, you will enjoy the right to free movement, effective immediately.

Ceobe:
???

Logistics Operator:
Am I not being sufficiently clear?

Vulcan:
I think she may not be getting some of the legalese here.

Vulcan:
Just give me the documents. I'll make sure she gets it.

Logistics Operator:
That would be a big help.

Vulcan:
........

Vulcan:
..................

Vulcan:
Okay.

Vulcan:
Kay.

Ceobe:
Hm?

Vulcan:
Why were you out on your own back there?

Ceobe:
I wanted to go to Minos.

Ceobe:
But I think I went the wrong way.

Logistics Operator:
According to information provided by the Leithanian branch, she traveled from Bolívar all the way to the Trijunction of the East, where she then turned back.

Logistics Operator:
At that point, she made a large arc across the north, until finally being rescued by our people in Leithanien.

Logistics Operator:
This girl can walk.

Logistics Operator:
But why do you ask?

Vulcan:
If you made it to Minos, what were you going to do?

Ceobe:
Ask my name. And then...

Ceobe:
And then....

Ceobe:
I haven't thought that far ahead yet.

Logistics Operator:
Operator Vulcan, please inform her of the situation and let her make her decision.

Vulcan:
So what would you want to do after that?

Ceobe:
I don't know....

Vulcan:
Think it through.

Vulcan:
It's important.

Ceobe:
I... I want to eat until I'm full every day.

Logistics Operator:
Operator Vulcan, what are you——

Vulcan:
Shh! Quiet!

Logistics Operator:
........

Ceobe:
I want to spend half the day in a hot bath, and then wrap myself in a warm blanket.

Ceobe:
And lay there until I'm hungry again.

Ceobe:
And... and...

Ceobe:
And I want a big house where I can keep all my treasures.

Ceobe:
Carrying them around all day is kind of hard.

Ceobe:
Especially when I'm hungry.

Ceobe:
And I guess that's it.

Vulcan:
Understood.

Vulcan:
If there was a place where you could eat and drink and have a house to sleep in, would you want to stay there?

Ceobe:
Who wouldn't?

Vulcan:
But most of the time, you have to think a lot, and you have to fight a lot of bad guys, and sometimes you might not sleep for days. Even then, would you want to stay there?

Ceobe:
I'm not very good with thinking...

Ceobe:
But...

Ceobe:
Vulcan, ma'am, are you talking about being a hero?

Vulcan:
A hero?

Logistics Operator:
Haha——Ah, um, ahem.

Vulcan:
Heh. Yes. I'm talking about being a hero.

Ceobe:
I want to go there.

Ceobe:
I want to eat, and be a hero.

Ceobe:
What more could I ever want?

Vulcan:
Good.

Logistics Operator:
Shouldn't you help her——

Vulcan:
She's made up her mind, please take care of her paperwork.

Vulcan:
If she needs a sponsor, you can put down my name.

Logistics Operator:
But you're——

Vulcan:
Should I repeat myself?

Logistics Operator:
Uh...

Logistics Operator:
If you insist, I have nothing more to say.

Logistics Operator:
I'll prepare a follow-up test for Ceobe at once.

Logistics Operator:
But please be aware that you will need to attach the appropriate guarantees——

Logistics Operator:
——and an explanation.

Vulcan:
I will.

Logistics Operator:
Well, I'll take my leave then.

Vulcan:
See yourself out.

Ceobe:
Hmmm....

Ceobe:
What's happening?

Vulcan:
Nothing.

Vulcan:
You still have a lot to learn, a lot of fights to fight.

Vulcan:
It'll be a lot of work.

Vulcan:
Get some rest while you still can.

Ceobe:
Oh.

Ceobe:
Hm....

Ceobe:
Ma'am?

Vulcan:
Huh?

Vulcan:
(We'll get used to that.)

Ceobe:
You want a honey biscuit? Lava baked them. They're good.

Vulcan:
May I?

Ceobe:
Here.

Vulcan:
Thanks.

Vulcan:
........

Vulcan:
(What's this flavor?)

Vulcan:
(It's kind of...)

Vulcan:
(The crust isn't crispy enough, and something's wrong with the honey seasoning.)

Vulcan:
(Other than that, it tastes exactly like the ones in Minos.)

Ceobe:
Is it good?

Vulcan:
Very good.

Ceobe:
Right?

Vulcan:
But.

Ceobe:
Huh?

Vulcan:
A biscuit like this should be eaten fresh out of the oven.

Vulcan:
Put some jam on it, and pair it with a cup of tea.

Ceobe:
Will it taste better?

Vulcan:
Yes.

Vulcan:
I'll ask Matterhorn next door to make some for you, when I get a chance.

Vulcan:
He's great at making these sorts of things.

Ceobe:
R- really?

Vulcan:
Yes.

Ceobe:
Thank you, ma'am!

Vulcan:
You're going to be subjected to a lot of testing over the next few days.

Vulcan:
We'll have to fix you up a bit, and your weapons too.

Vulcan:
How do you want them?

Ceobe:
Y- you'll fix them for me?

Vulcan:
It's a blacksmith's duty to make sure a weapon meets its wielder's needs.

Vulcan:
Just tell me what you need.

Ceobe:
Um, I want all my treasures to look as good as the weapons here in your house.

Ceobe:
And, um, I want the other weapons to be the same color as my axe.

Ceobe:
Is that too much trouble?

Vulcan:
That won't take much time.

Vulcan:
I might be done in time for you to surprise Hibiscus and Lava.

Ceobe:
Really?

Vulcan:
Yes.

Vulcan:
Bring your weapons. Let's get started.

Ceobe:
Yeah!!!

Lava:
Phew. *Pant*. *Pant*. I'm exhausted.

Lava:
Little Perro is gonna be okay, right Hibiscus?

Hibiscus:
She's so good at fighting, and Vulcan is so nice. What could go wrong?

Lava:
Huh? Vulcan? Nice?

Lava:
Anyway, I know she won't do anything bad.

Lava:
But I'm more worried about that logistics operator who showed up in the middle of training. He had a pretty big file with him.

Lava:
Gave me a bad feeling.

Hibiscus:
Uh oh, not this again.

Hibiscus:
In my experience, your 'bad feelings' usually signal good things.

Lava:
I hope you're right... oh, we're here.

Vulcan:
Who is it?

Lava:
It's Lava. We're here to see the little Pe——Miss Perro.

Vulcan:
It's unlocked. Come on in.

Ceobe:
Ah, Lava and Hibiscus! You're here!

Hibiscus:
Huh? Miss Perro?

Lava:
Wh- what happened to your weapons?

Ceobe:
Don't call me Miss Perro anymore. Call me Ceobe.

Ceobe:
That's my name!

Lava & Hibiscus:
Huh——?!

(Several weeks later)

Rhodes Island Landship

Logistics Department, Small Conference Room

HR Director:
I think you know why I asked you here today.

Vulcan:
How did she do?

HR Director:
How do you think?

HR Director:
Fancy a guess?

HR Director:
She doesn't take orders. She just throws her weapons around and makes a scene.

HR Director:
How do you think she did?

Vulcan:
Just tell me her results.

HR Director:
Her results. Heh.

HR Director:
........

HR Director:
She passed.

Vulcan:
Oh.

HR Director:
She made a mess of herself and failed a bunch of tests. But her personal character and potential qualify her to be an operator.

HR Director:
And, taking into account the opinions of several of her proctors, the other details are less important.

Vulcan:
The Doctor is never wrong about anyone.

HR Director:
Neither are you.

HR Director:
Well then, it's time.

HR Director:
Can I get a reason now?

HR Director:
Normally, the operator assessment process is initiated by the individual herself.

HR Director:
We typically look poorly on situations where an individual has the decision made for her. Especially when there is no guardian or relative involved.

Vulcan:
Sorry.

HR Director:
That's all I get?

HR Director:
Ah well, it's not that big a deal. Rules were made to be broken.

HR Director:
Just give me a reason. I have to pass something upstairs.

Vulcan:
A girl who likes weapons can't be bad.

HR Director:
All right.

HR Director:
Hold on, uh, that's it?

Vulcan:
Yes.

HR Director:
I'm gonna need a little more than that. A few more sentences or there's no way I can finish this report.

Vulcan:
I have to?

HR Director:
It's important.

Vulcan:
Well....

Vulcan:
I'm a blacksmith. I don't know people. But I do know weapons.

Vulcan:
If you have someone with absolutely no knowledge of weapon maintenance and upkeep,

Vulcan:
her weapons are going to get damaged after a long period of use.

Vulcan:
Still, she did her best to keep her equipment in good shape, to the best of her abilities.

Vulcan:
That was enough for me to affirm her talent and potential.

HR Director:
How can you be sure she doesn't know weapon maintenance?

Vulcan:
She can't use a whetstone, she doesn't know her oils. That's long before we start talking about any rules or scientific principles.

Vulcan:
The only thing she knows how to do is polish her weapons. And she's good at that.

HR Director:
Okay. What else?

Vulcan:
That should be enough.

Vulcan:
You know better than me what has to go on a resume.

HR Director:
I do.

HR Director:
She's a Bolívarian, traveled the whole world looking for Minos, and never quite found it.

HR Director:
Still don't get why.

HR Director:
All I can say is her spirit is commendable.

Vulcan:
It's always good to have faith.

HR Director:
That's what I'm curious about.

HR Director:
You usually don't pay much attention to people.

HR Director:
This Ceobe, is she that special?

HR Director:
What is it about her that caught your attention?

Vulcan:
Her weapons.

HR Director:
I'm serious, Vulcan.

Vulcan:
I'm serious too.

HR Director:
How so?

Vulcan:
Her name was carved into that axe.

Vulcan:
Minos isn't Higashi. We don't just tape our names onto weapons in case we lose them.

Vulcan:
If your name is on a weapon, it means something big.

Vulcan:
Plus,

Vulcan:
I couldn't forge that axe.

Vulcan:
But that technique, I know I've seen it somewhere...

Vulcan:
I want to help her solve the mystery of that weapon.

Vulcan:
Then, maybe someday, she'll come back and solve something for me.

Vulcan:
I guess you could say I'm just a selfish blacksmith.

HR Director:
?

HR Director:
Hmmm....

HR Director:
You craftsmen have your secrets.

HR Director:
Well, whatever.

HR Director:
That's enough for me.

HR Director:
Sorry to bother you. Go get some rest.

Vulcan:
I'm sorry too.

HR Director:
No need. I'm just doing my job here.

Vulcan:
Thanks.

HR Director:
Don't thank me either. Next time you're up for a drink, come by while I'm on. I've got a new mix, I'm calling it 'Kazimierz Fury.' Give it a try sometime?

Vulcan:
Heh. Sure.

HR Director:
Ha....

HR Director:
That's why I say HR ain't easy.

HR Director:
Kids these days don't know how to write a proper CV.

HR Director:
It takes a good chat to dig up all the juicy stuff hidden down there.

HR Director:
It's all mysteries wrapped up in enigmas.

HR Director:
Damn it, I'm an HR director, not a detective!

HR Director:
(Short, but passionate words in a Victorian dialect)

Logistics Operator:
Director?

HR Director:
Oh, what is it?

Logistics Operator:
Director.... we're ready to interview the new operator. If you would.

HR Director:
I see. By the way, here's Ceobe's contract, all signed and notarized. File it for me and then send someone to inform the operator of her formal onboarding.

Logistics Operator:
Understood.

HR Director:
Just a moment. Be sure operator Vulcan is there for that. She may be needed to explain some of the formal terms and conditions.

Logistics Operator:
Understood.

HR Director:
Okay, enough chatter, back to work.

HR Director:
........(flipping through new operator files)

HR Director:
Heh.

HR Director:
Sure enough.

HR Director:
Another one who can't write a CV worth a damn.

HR Director:
Looks like I'm in for another long evening.
