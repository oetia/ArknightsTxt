9:39 P.M. Inside the Rhodes Island Landship

Orchid:
Phew.... Finally finished.

Logistics Operator:
Good work, Orchid.

Orchid:
I've gotten to know you all so well. It's like I'm part of the team now, huh?

Logistics Operator:
Ahaha. You've really gotten good at this, Orchid.

Orchid:
Ha... I'm better at this than looking after the circus, that's for sure.

Logistics Operator:
Why don't you apply for a transfer to logistics then?

Orchid:
Huh?

Logistics Operator:
You know, people like you who come out of the, uh, more normal world usually end up working in logistics. It's kind of unusual to become a combat operator.

Logistics Operator:
We've all been wondering why you decided to go to the front lines, actually.

Orchid:
You wonder why, huh...?

Logistics Operator:
What kind of work would you like to do for Rhodes Island, Orchid?

Logistics Operator:
The assessments show you have an aptitude for Originium Arts. If you're interested, we could put you on the front lines.

Logistics Operator:
But since you are a civilian with no relevant combat experience, we still recommend that you join a logistics-related section.

Logistics Operator:
Of course, rest assured that even if you go into a combat role, we won't put you in danger. No more than you can handle, anyway.

Orchid:
What does logistics do?

Logistics Operator:
Well... It's a pretty broad department with a lot of functions. But, in general, you can think of it as the jobs that keep Rhodes Island running.

Logistics Operator:
Since there are more clerical jobs, it's well suited to people like you. Folks used to city life.

Orchid:
(He means sitting in an office...?)

Orchid:
(I came here for a change. I don't want to spend my life in a cubicle.)

Orchid:
I... I want to go into a combat role.

Logistics Operator.:
Are you sure? It can be tough being a front line operator.

Orchid:
Yes. I want to give it a try.

Logistics Operator:
Okay then.

Orchid:
(I probably shouldn't tell him I wasn't interested in office work.)

Orchid:
........Let's just say I sort of fell into it.

Logistics Operator:
Ah, yeah. That'll happen if you don't know what you're getting yourself into.

Orchid:
Oh, oh yeah...?

Logistics Operator:
But I seem to remember we have a way to deal with these sorts of things. Let me take a look here....

Logistics Operator:
Ah, yep. Here we go.

Logistics Operator:
'Combat operators of civilian origin who, within one year of working as a combat operator, find themselves unsuited to the role, may apply for reclassification as a logistics operator. It will be unconditionally approved.'

Logistics Operator:
You haven't been here that long, so you should be good to go. Actually, everyone in A6 should be good. Except Spot, since he was a Sargon soldier.

Logistics Operator:
And even with Spot, I bet we can find a little wiggle room.

Orchid:
Oh yeah? I never thought about it before.

Logistics Operator:
It's not like our work is any easier than that of a combat operator. Rhodes Island depends on us to keep moving.

Orchid:
Yeah, right. Thanks. I'll think about it.

Popukar:
Orchid, are you done yet?

Orchid:
I just finished.

Popukar:
Okay~

Logistics Operator:
Well, if it isn't little Popukar. Is she waiting for you?

Orchid:
Yes. I bumped into her on the way and she came along.

Logistics Operator:
Now that you mention it, I think I remember you applied for a double room to share with her?

Orchid:
Yes. *Sigh* That girl is a handful. And who sends a child that small out to war anyway?

Orchid:
But the rest of the team is either unreliable or even more trouble than she is. So here we are.

Popukar:
Orchid, are you done yet?

Orchid:
Coming. All right, I'd better go.

Logistics Operator:
Don't forget what we talked about. I'll be waiting for your answer.

Orchid:
Right.

Orchid:
Ha.... Isn't it ironic? I became a combat operator to ditch the office. And now look at me.

Orchid:
Am I doomed to the rat race, no matter what path I take...?

Popukar:
Orchid, what's a rat race?

Orchid:
It's a miserable life, sitting in an office for 8 hours a day, growing fat and sick, doing tedious, menial labor and sometimes putting in overtime.

Popukar:
Oh... don't get it.

Orchid:
Anyway, Popukar, how did you end up at Rhodes Island?

Popukar:
Um, Dr. Kal'tsit and Dr. Ansel bought me.

Orchid:
What? Bought?

Popukar:
Yeah. I used to work in a lumberyard.

Popukar:
One day, Dr. Ansel and Dr. Kal'tsit were passing by there and saw me. They played with me all day.

Popukar:
The next day, I don't know how or why, but Dr. Kal'tsit bought me.

Orchid:
A lumberyard?!

Popukar:
Yes. My mom and dad sent me to work in the lumberyard when I was very young. The boss was sometimes very mean to me. But at least he fed me...

Orchid:
Did you ever see your parents again?

Popukar:
Oh, no.... The boss said my mom and dad went very far away and couldn't come to see me. So I just had to wait.

Popukar:
Then Dr. Ansel said that if I was good, Rhodes Island would help me find my mom and dad, and I might see them again someday!

Popukar:
Hey, Orchid, why are you hugging me all of a sudden? What's wrong?

Orchid:
...Nothing. Sometimes a girl needs hugs is all.

Orchid:
How would you like to be like those boys and girls back there? Doing things in a chair, not needing to run around all the time?

Popukar:
Um, Dr. Ansel asked me the same question, but I don't really understand that kind of stuff. I just know I'm pretty strong.

Popukar:
But I've been trying really hard to learn to read. Then I can help you, and all those boys and girls in the office!

Orchid:
...Of course.

Popukar:
Yeah...! Orchid, what happened? You look really sad. Did I say something bad?

Orchid:
Not at all. It's my fault. I shouldn't have asked about that.

Popukar:
You're always so nice to me, Orchid. You can ask me anything.

Orchid:
Okay.

Catapult:
Orchid, why are you hugging Popukar in the middle of the corridor? People might get the wrong idea.

Orchid:
...Ahem. Don't worry about it.

Popukar:
Hi, Catapult!

Catapult:
Oh, hi Popukar.

Catapult:
Are you guys going home?

Orchid:
Yes. Now why are you all sweaty? You better not be running off to get yourself, and by extension me, into trouble.

Catapult:
Come on, Orchid, give me a little credit. I just finished a session with Midnight.

Orchid:
......A what with Midnight?

Catapult:
Huh? Don't tell me you don't know. Unless there's a mission, Midnight works out in the training room every day about this time.

Catapult:
I didn't have anything to do today, so he roped me in, worked my tail off, and finally let me go. Spot's there giving him the business now.

Orchid:
Why?

Catapult:
How should I know? I figured you'd be up on it. I just know I need to steer clear of Midnight around ten o'clock.

Popukar:
I knew about it! Midnight also got me to join. But then I hit him and he flew away and he didn't ask me again.

Catapult:
Bwahahahahaha! So that's the story. No wonder he dodged the question when I asked if he told you. Hahaha! My sides!

Orchid:
...All right. As long as you're not making trouble.

Catapult:
Why do you always come back to that?! This is discrimination, Orchid. You're always so nice to Popukar, even when she makes trouble!

Orchid:
I'd be so nice to you if you'd also go and sweetly apologize every time you did something bad.

Catapult:
That's beyond me. And if I have to apologize for stirring things up, then where's the fun in it?!

Orchid:
Just stay out of trouble to begin with!

Orchid:
You're lucky you're at Rhodes Island, anywhere else would have... Never mind. Forget it.

Catapult:
Come on, Orchid, just come out with it. Nowhere else can handle my personality. And I don't wanna change. Only Rhodes Island would want a freak like me!

Catapult:
But everybody here is talkative and awesome and the work is good and it pays well. I love it here.

Orchid:
*Sigh*. Great. As long as you're happy.

Orchid:
Anyway, hurry back and take a shower. A girl shouldn't be out walking around all sweaty.

Catapult:
Sure~

Catapult:
Hey, Orchid, the dorms are the other way.

Orchid:
I'm going to check out the training room.

Catapult:
Oh. Popukar, why don't you come to my room tonight? I'll tell you a story.

Popukar:
Okay~

Training Room

Spot:
Did you skip dinner, Midnight? Kinda weak.

Midnight:
My swordsmanship is about agility and cunning.

Spot:
Keep talking. Music to my ears.

Midnight:
Ah hah!

Spot:
Slow. But not bad. I can tell you did eat enough after all.

Orchid:
........

Popukar:
Wow, Midnight and Spot are fighting.

Popukar:
Can I...?

Orchid:
Let's wait for them to finish.

Popukar:
Oh——

Midnight:
Pfft. *Pant*... water, please.

Spot:
Here.

Midnight:
........Phew. Thanks.

Midnight:
Your military lineage shows, Spot. You're usually so lethargic, but you're clearly much better than me at this.

Spot:
You've got something to be proud of. If you didn't have the basics, I'd have my comics in one hand while I fought you with the other.

Midnight:
Am I so weak?

Spot:
How can I get my point across without hurting your feelings?

Midnight:
No need.

Spot:
But I'm actually curious, you were an escort before, right?

Spot:
You've got the fundamentals. I can tell. A couple years of practice.

Spot:
That's not up to military standard. But for a civilian, you can fight.

Midnight:
Can I take that as a compliment?

Spot:
I'm mostly trying to convince myself that the most useless guy on our team actually has something to offer.

Midnight:
Haha... Actually...

Popukar:
Midnight! Spot!

Midnight:
Huh?

Spot:
Orchid's here. You're boned.

Midnight:
Why's that?

Spot:
I don't know, but she looks like my mom did whenever things were about to get real bad for me.

Midnight:
Oh, you're wrong about that. And it's my turn to teach you some tricks for dealing with women.

Spot:
*Snort*.

Midnight:
Good evening, Miss Popukar, Miss Orchid.

Orchid:
What are you doing here?

Midnight:
As you can see, I'm doing my daily exercise.

Orchid:
And why don't I know about this routine?

Midnight:
I never thought you'd be interested, Miss Orchid. And it's all on my own time.

Orchid:
...Fair enough.

Orchid:
But we're normal people. And Instructor Dobermann made it clear that civilian teams like us won't ever end up on dangerous missions. So what's the point?

Midnight:
Oh, good question. Mm, a truly fantastic question, Orchid.

Orchid:
.......?

Midnight:
Let's take a break for now, shall we, Spot?

Spot:
Yeah, whatever. I'm just here to help out. I'll go get a comic book to read.

Midnight:
Orchid, do you know what the secret to success is in my line of work?

Orchid:
What are you talking about?

Midnight:
That's a rhetorical question, to start things off. I can continue without an answer.

Orchid:
I'd guess the trick is to be handsome, first and foremost. And then be a decent talker?

Midnight:
No, no, and no. Although I consider myself quite beautiful, and I do know how to pay a compliment...

Spot:
Bleh.

Popukar:
What's wrong with Spot?

Spot:
Nothing, just looking at a clown in a whole new light.

Midnight:
Heh heh. Confidence is very important. But by far the most important is to treat all your clients equally.

Midnight:
That is——When you step into my realm, my presence, then, whoever you are, the only thing you are, is my client.

Orchid:
........What's the point of all this? Are you trying to say that everyone's the same to you?

Midnight:
Not at all, my dear sweet captain. Clever as you are, you've never thought this through.

Midnight:
It's not that everyone's the same to me. It's that, simply, everyone's the same.

Midnight:
The iron-fisted career woman, tyrant of her office section, could actually just be wearing a mask for the sake of her work. If she wears it long enough, she may forget how to take it back off.

Midnight:
The outwardly homely housewife, whose husband likely cheated on her long ago, she stays at home telling no one of her troubles, with no choice but to come to drink with me.

Midnight:
An ill-tempered fashion designer with her strong woman facade may just fear the gossip of others, and the resulting loss of trust.

Orchid:
Do you have a death wish?

Midnight:
Ha ha, did you think I was talking about you? People like this abound.

Midnight:
Everyone in the city, after unloading their identities and responsibilities, is exactly the same. Each and every one.

Midnight:
So why, at Rhodes Island, would things be any different?

Midnight:
Do the elite operators who go diving headlong into a warzone, come back and unplug themselves like so much machinery?

Midnight:
No, they drink and chat in the bar. They care for their freshly potted plants in the greenhouse. They listen to music, they read.

Midnight:
They complain when a mission is too hard, or chuckle at how hilariously easy it was. They cry, they laugh, they mope, they hurt, and they die.

Midnight:
They're no different from us, are they?

Orchid:
...You're a boy who knows how to give a speech.

Midnight:
Thank you for the compliment.

Orchid:
...*Sigh*. That all makes sense. But I still feel like it's not completely true.

Midnight:
And I can't blame you for that. My industry, as it is, always had a bit of an underbelly to it. I have that advantage.

Midnight:
But not you, Orchid. You grew up entirely in the light of day.

Midnight:
The greatest hardships for you were lower pay than you'd like, insufficiently clear skin, traffic on your commute. Those sorts of things.

Midnight:
This world of violence and bloodshed is indeed a brave new world for you.

Midnight:
But you're here. You made your choice. Shouldn't you at least try to understand it instead of shackling yourself to the common sense of your past?

Orchid:
The common sense of my past...

Midnight:
I'm not trying to be preachy. I'm definitely not qualified to preach. But wouldn't the 'fashion guru' of Rhodes Island understand that?

Orchid:
Even you know about that, huh?

Midnight:
I've talked to quite a few senior operators. I've heard a lot of interesting stories.

Orchid:
And you're getting in good with them?

Midnight:
I get in good with anyone, as long as they understand my language. This is my special power as the Devil of the Eastern Night.

Orchid:
Right.

Midnight:
So you know perfectly well that the people who ask you to design their outfits and give fashion tips are ordinary people like us, don't you?

Orchid:
........

Midnight:
By the way, Spot. You asked me why I knew how to fight when I was just an 'escort.'

Spot:
Huh? Ah, oh yeah, I forgot.

Midnight:
You wound me. This is a bit of a story, so let's take it to the cafeteria. My treat.

Spot:
Sounds like a pain in the ass. Can I pass? I don't really care.

Midnight:
Heh heh. I'm afraid not.

Spot:
Damn. I blew it. I should've slipped out halfway through.

Midnight:
I said it was my treat, but you could still show a little decorum...

Spot:
Do we have to?

Popukar:
Mmmmm..... It's so good! Why aren't you eating, Orchid?

Orchid:
I never eat after dinner.

Midnight:
That's the mark of a modern woman.

Orchid:
........

Midnight:
Ahem, right, back to business then.

Midnight:
First of all, if I may be so bold as to ask, Orchid, how did you contract Oripathy? If that's too personal a question, you don't have to answer.

Orchid:
........It's not a great story. Just one day I suddenly noticed a little crystalline growth on my body.

Orchid:
The doctors said I must have been exposed to some Originium without even knowing. I still don't know exactly how I got it.

Orchid:
That's it.

Midnight:
Ah, I see. No wonder you're having this little crisis.

Midnight:
So, let me tell you my experience.

Midnight:
There was a younger man working in my club.

Midnight:
He was my polar opposite: bright, sunny disposition, straightforward. Instantly likeable.

Midnight:
Of course, no one who works in my industry could be called naive. But if I'm the type to make malicious assumptions about people, he's the type to trust them.

Spot:
Sounds like the type I would hate.

Midnight:
Is that your way of saying you like me, Spot?

Spot:
Orchid, is there really no cure for narcissism?

Orchid:
I'll ask Medical later. Maybe there's hope.

Midnight:
Heh heh. As I said before, I treat all my clients equally. Meaning I don't change my approach based on one's status or identity.

Midnight:
I make an active effort towards that goal. But for him, it was second nature.

Midnight:
From my position atop the industry, I could see that he would be the one to surpass me.

Popukar:
So that person surpassed Midnight?

Orchid:
........It can't be that simple.

Popukar:
Huh?

Midnight:
........Yeah, it would be nice if that was the whole story.

Midnight:
Now that I think about it, I actually did him a disservice. He didn't come from a good family. He needed the money. To him, I must've looked like the king of the world.

Midnight:
If I was out of his way, he would have been able to make it in that world.

Midnight:
I should have taught him much earlier how to situate himself, how to handle money, and how to be what people needed him to be.

Midnight:
Had I done that, maybe we wouldn't have ended up at each other's throats.

Orchid:
He was jealous of you? And you didn't notice?

Midnight:
........He hid it well. Or rather, he didn't even notice it himself.

Midnight:
It wasn't until he almost killed me the first time that I realized this flaw in my understanding of human nature.

Spot:
I think it's got nothing to do with human nature. You're just too nice.

Orchid:
Right? I never thought of you as the type to mentor a newbie.

Popukar:
But Midnight is a really good man! I always knew!

Midnight:
Thank you, Popukar.

Spot:
But you said 'first time,' which means there was a second time.

Midnight:
Right.

Midnight:
He did almost kill me the first time. Almost. I'm confident, had that been his second attempt to kill a man, I wouldn't be sitting here.

Midnight:
But I am.

Spot:
I bet five Lungmen dollars you bitched out.

Midnight:
No. I didn't. It's just... I couldn't have expected what happened next.

Midnight:
At the time, I saw the world as Orchid does. I never thought of it as a place of malice and bloodshed.

Midnight:
I muscled him out of the industry and learned how to handle a sword. I thought that would be enough. I really did.

Midnight:
Until one day, I discovered a health problem.

Orchid:
Your Oripathy....

Midnight:
He paid my agent to infect me somehow.

Midnight:
The second time he came looking for me, he was Infected himself. And he brought his 'friends' with him.

Midnight:
I had seen a lot of hate in my work. I thought I understood it. But when it was actually directed at me, I felt it burning in a way I hadn't ever before imagined.

Spot:
But you won.

Midnight:
I did. Even if I can't go toe to toe with you, I can fight off a dozen thugs and walk away with my life.

Midnight:
It was then, with my own hands, I took his...

Popukar:
Waaaaaaahhhhhh!

Orchid:
What's wrong, Popukar?

Popukar:
Poor Midniiiiiiight! Waaaaahhh...

Midnight:
Don't cry, Popukar.

Midnight:
Honestly, I should thank him for showing me how immature I was.

Midnight:
After that, I learned about a place called Rhodes Island and made up my mind to leave the industry and come all the way here after registering with the office in Higashi.

Midnight:
Along the way, I saw a lot, and thought a lot more. I came to Rhodes Island with a deep understanding of this one thing.

Orchid:
What are you looking at?

Midnight:
Let me share my thoughts with you, Orchid.

Midnight:
I'm not trying to say that because we've seen the cruel reality of the world here, we need to accept it.

Midnight:
From our point of view, it's only natural to think that most of Rhodes Island's operators have been through unnecessary pain.

Midnight:
We shouldn't feel inferior for having grown up in our relative safety, but it isn't an excuse for us to fight it either.

Midnight:
Life is the same everywhere.

Midnight:
Where we used to live, the only way to get what we wanted was to work hard and earn money. It's actually the same here.

Midnight:
We could have chosen to join the logistics department and put in the same effort there. But I chose the path of war.

Orchid:
........Aren't you afraid to die?

Midnight:
I think we're all afraid to die.

Midnight:
But as you've learned in your time here, Orchid, sooner or later you have to fight to defend something.

Midnight:
This would be a fine time to say 'I'm training hard so I can be strong to defend you, Orchid,' but I'd like you to think about something instead——

Midnight:
What kind of life do you want to lead at Rhodes Island?

Orchid:
........I understand.

Popukar:
Um... but I don't...

Spot:
Good. This is something you'll never have to worry about. Why not eat up instead? Here, you can have mine.

Popukar:
Wow, thanks Spot!

Midnight:
Hehe. He's right. You don't have to worry about this stuff, Popukar.

Midnight:
And forgive me for dumping all this on you, Orchid, but the question you asked me is one I've been asking myself a lot since I came to Rhodes Island. So I had a lot to say about it.

Orchid:
.......Well, thanks for that.

Midnight:
Oh, wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles! The blessed savior Orchid has finally shown me gratitude! Brother Spot, Sister Popukar, such luck you have brought me!

Orchid:
You're a dead man. Popukar, we need to get to bed. We have a big day tomorrow.

Popukar:
Oh, we're done?

Orchid:
We're done.

Popukar:
Okay.... Good night, Spot. Good night, Midnight.

Spot:
Good night.

Midnight:
Sweet dreams to the two beautiful ladies.

Spot:
So you're not worried we'll turn out like the guy from your club?

Midnight:
Heh heh. Not to toot my own horn, but I have a lot more confidence as a judge of character these days.

Spot:
*Snort*.

Midnight:
Besides, we're on the same team. It's good to get to know each other better, no?

Spot:
Sure. But I never imagined you'd be hung up on all that garbage.

Midnight:
Now that I've thought it through, I don't need to trouble myself anymore.

Spot:
I guess so. Say, did you use any of those tricks for dealing with women just now?

Midnight:
I did indeed. The most important trick of all——telling the truth.

Spot:
Sounds pretty easy to me.

Midnight:
It's important because it's simple.

Popukar:
Orchid, when we get back, can Catapult tell me a story?

Orchid:
Not tonight. Midnight kept us out too late.

Popukar:
Oh....

Popukar:
Okay. I'm just glad to see you happy, Orchid.

Orchid:
Oh? Have I been unhappy lately?

Popukar:
Um, I don't know how to say this. But you seemed very upset after we left the logistics department. Not now though. Now you look happy.

Orchid:
Did I...? I guess I did.

Orchid:
Thank you, Popukar.

Popukar:
Did I do something?

Orchid:
Hehe. You just don't know it yet.

???:
Excuse me, are you Orchid?

Orchid:
Oh? You are...?

Sora:
I'm Sora, with Penguin Logistics. I've heard you're kind of an expert on fashion, and pretty handy with a needle and thread. Can I talk to you for a minute?

6:23 P.M. Inside the Rhodes Island Landship

Logistics Operator A:
So you decided to carry on as a combat operator. That's too bad. But it's your call, Orchid. We'll respect it.

Orchid.:
Yes. It may not be a good fit for me, but it's a special opportunity. I don't want to waste it.

Logistics Operator A:
That's true. Sitting in the office all day is pretty boring.... Maybe I should apply for a transfer and try it out.

Logistics Operator B.:
You're dreaming. You wouldn't last two seconds with Dobermann.

Logistics Operator A:
Oh yeah, I've heard about that one. It's pretty cool you made it through her training, Orchid.

Orchid:
You get used to it... Anyway, that's all for today.

Logistics Operator A:
Heading back so early?

Orchid:
Yeah, I have a thing.

Logistics Operator A.:
Okay, see you tomorrow.

Orchid:
See you tomorrow.

Orchid:
Oof... All these aches. That's what I get for skipping the gym that long.

Orchid:
I can't even move my hand to fill out a form.

Orchid:
Ugh, why did I do this to myself?

Catapult:
Orchid!!!! There you are. I've been looking for you!

Orchid:
........What's the matter? What did Popukar break this time?

Catapult:
Nothing. It's Midnight, he's sparring with Popukar. You've gotta see this!

Orchid:
...Okay. I'm totally out of it today anyway.

Catapult:
What made you want to sign up for fitness training? It's not like you.

Orchid:
Call it a change of heart.

Catapult:
Oh. Want me to give you a shoulder rub?

Orchid:
Okay, out with it, what did you do this time?

Catapult:
Woah, hey, I didn't do anything!

Orchid:
I'll believe you, for once.

Catapult:
........

Orchid:
What?

Catapult:
You seem kinda different lately.

Orchid:
Do I?

Catapult:
I can't quite put my finger on it... But yeah...

Orchid:
Come on, weren't we going to see Midnight eat shit?

Catapult:
Hell yeah we were!

Orchid:
Hah.

Orchid:
Go looking for trouble and you just might find it.
