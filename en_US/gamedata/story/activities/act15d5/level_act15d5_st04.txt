Our sister, Hildegard. Today, we see you off.

May the light extol your path forth, may piety and conviction be forever by your side.

The bells of Landen Monastery cross long through... hm? What?

*cough* The bells of Landen Monastery cross long through the years, tolling centuries of... Wine!?

Wh—Why has wine been left here? Where did... my Lord, don't tell me the old man snuck it in? Shh! Sshhh!

To be brief, may Landen's centuries of glory be with you! Now, Hildegard! Come here and help! Help us get the wine barrel open!

Hee-hee, we can't have a farewell without this, can we? Now, before the old man comes back! Cheers!

......

Hildegard:
Ah... did I fall asleep?

Hildegard:
Someone's knocking at the door... it's this late already!?

Bison:
Good morning, Cleric Hildegard.

Hildegard:
Good morning, or should I say good afternoon, Mr. Bison. It's been long since I laid on a bed. I seem to be somewhat remiss.

Bison:
It's been a long journey, I don't blame you. I came to confirm your travel itinerary today; hopefully I didn't disturb your rest?

Hildegard:
No worries at all. I thank all your efforts as well.

Bison:
You came from Laterano... such a far-off country, all the way to Lungmen. It can't have been easy, can it?

Hildegard:
It wasn't.

Hildegard:
This is my own first time so far from Laterano... Long-distance travel isn't as simple as admiring the scenery, it turns out.

Bison:
Ha ha. Even seasoned Messengers still take every method they can to keep their moods level...

Hildegard:
The life of a Messenger must be tough.

Bison:
So, Miss Hildegard, was last night's accommodation to your liking?

Hildegard:
Mm-hm. It's a stone's throw from the city center, and very cheaply priced. You've got some keen insight.

Bison:
You don't need to worry about expenses, actually. MountainDash Logistics will reimburse the costs of your time in Lungmen.

Hildegard:
No, as a representative of Landen Monastery, I can't depend on the wealth of others. Forgive me for that.

Hildegard:
What's more, I'm on this mission precisely to address the many problems besetting the Monastery. I could never partake excessively of others' friendship on their land, all while indulging myself.

Bison:
I see... your mindset really is admirable.

Hildegard:
A compulsory lesson, and nothing more.

Bison:
Your meeting with Eurill is set for tomorrow evening. May I ask what your plans are for today?

Hildegard:
Um... I'll take a small walk around the area. It's my first time in Yan, after all.

Bison:
Will you require a tour guide or entourage to be arranged, then?

Hildegard:
Ah, no. I'd like to look about myself. I'm just satisfying my own curiosity, that's all; I wouldn't like to trouble you all.

Bison:
Alright... then I won't keep bothering you.

Hildegard:
Thank you for your understanding.

Hildegard:
If I may be so bold as to ask, Mr. Eurill is your father, is he not?

Bison:
Hm? Uh, he is. What about it?

Hildegard:
No, forgive me. It's just that I've noticed you treat him wholly as if he's your boss while you're on the job, Mr. Bison...

Bison:
Uh-huh. If I always rely on my relationship with the old man, how could I ever surpass him?

Hildegard:
Hahah, I see you're someone of great ambitions too, then, Mr. Bison.

Bison:
Hardly. If it hadn't come up with you, Cleric Hildegard, I wouldn't even talk about anything like it with a client.

Bison:
Well, I won't bother you any further...

Bison:
But if you have any spare time, I'd like to hear your stories about Laterano. Just as you're curious about Lungmen, I... think about that place a lot.

Hildegard:
But of course.

Bison:
Alright. I wish you a pleasant day.

Hildegard:
Lungmen, then.

Hildegard:
I don't really have any travel funds, but... I suppose I'll wander around some.

Hildegard:
After all, 'opportunity and faith alike dwell in markets and bells.'

Male Lungmenite:
Your dad's too set in his ways! This is Lungmen, come on!

Female Lungmenite:
But it's a craft our old place passed down from generation to generation...

Male Lungmenite:
Look at the age we're in now! How's manual labor going to make any money?

Female Lungmenite:
That's true. That's something my dad needs to be talked over for.

Hildegard:
......

Male Lungmenite:
What number were we in the queue again?

Female Lungmenite:
Number 21. It'll be us pretty soon now. Why's this dessert shop so crowded...

Hildegard:
I'm number 31.

Hildegard:
So sweet...

Hildegard:
Oh?

Snowsant:
Huh...?

Snowsant:
Uh... a-are you the visitor from Laterano?

Hildegard:
Hm? Do you know of me?

Snowsant:
Uh, yes, actually, for certain reasons my house is currently uninhabitable, so the L.G.D. gave me a residence at the same inn as you... erm, I'm actually right across from you...

Hildegard:
So I see... what a coincidence, then.

Hildegard:
Ah, where are my manners? I should introduce myself first. I come from Laterano's Landen Monastery. Please, call me Hildegard. You might be?

Snowsant:
Y-Y-You don't need to be all polite to me, I'm just an average engineer... engineer, codename Snowsant...

Snowsant:
Actually, um, why isn't a person of your status living in a more high-class apartment instead?

Hildegard:
Ahahah... I have a few troubles, too, but it's moreso to remind myself. You needn't be so modest with me, either. I'm just touring around right now, that's all.

Hildegard:
Here. Would you like some?

Snowsant:
Are these... cakes?

Hildegard:
I'd noticed they were famous, and so I bought two extra, but I hadn't imagined the flavor would be so intense.

Hildegard:
That said, if such things can gain widespread popularity, then perhaps the goods the Monastery can offer may not suit Lungmen...

Snowsant:
Are you sure you can give me these?!

Hildegard:
Eh? Ah, by all means.

Snowsant:
Th... thank you...

Hildegard:
(She's just like a hungry little cystybeast...) Ahem. Do eat a little slower.

Hildegard:
Snowsant, was it? Would you be able to accompany me for a while longer?

Snowsant:
Nmp, *sigh*. Of... Of course, Ma'am! I'm on vacation today!

Hildegard:
D—Don't shout 'Ma'am' like that; I feel a little bad now...

Hildegard:
I hadn't noticed, but it's already evening now.

Hildegard:
The days without hearing the bells...

Snowsant:
Miss Hildegard, is something wrong?

Hildegard:
Ah. Nothing. I just feel like the time passes so fast.

Snowsant:
In the end, today was a day off, and the traffic jams were all so bad. We just wandered around Lungmen city center a little and it's already dark now.

Hildegard:
Snowsant, what kind of place is Columbia, I wonder?

Snowsant:
Huh? Let me think... uh, everything's so bright all the time, it's really technological, and...

Snowsant:
A little inhuman...?

Snowsant:
O-Of course, I only stayed in the research institute! To be clear, I never went more than two kilometers from my workplace!

Snowsant:
Ohh, that tiny little back-and-forth life... I feel queasy...

Hildegard:
Hahah... forget I mentioned it. Don't force yourself.

Hildegard:
Sigh.

Snowsant:
Miss Hildegard, what kind of... place is Landen Monastery? I've only heard about the Notarial Hall before...

Hildegard:
...Bread.

Snowsant:
Bread?

Hildegard:
It's ancient, a convent situated amongst the wheat fields and hills.

Hildegard:
It was originally for the training of Apostolic warriors. Its greatest difference from the Notarial Hall and the Apostolic Knights is that Landen Monastery accepts people from countries the world over.

Hildegard:
But...

Snowsant:
Gulp. But..?

Hildegard:
But these last few years have been too peaceful! The Notarial Hall mopped up every last bit of our work! We didn't get a single new disciple this year! The old man's cohort refuses any grants on the grounds of teaching the Monastery to be self-reliant!

Hildegard:
It's about to go bankrupt. The time-honored Landen Monastery is about to go BANKRUPT because of its financial issues!!

Snowsant:
Miss Hildegard, should you say 'bankrupt' for a monastery...?

Hildegard:
It's the closest word there is. Take it or leave it.

Hildegard:
*cough* *cough*.

Snowsant:
And that's why you left Laterano, Miss Hildegard?

Hildegard:
There always has to be a way. Fortunately, the Monastery's reputation aside, people might not think we're much more than ornamental, but at the very least, we still have our grand wheat field...

Hildegard:
I've troubled you enough for today, Snowsant.

Snowsant:
N-No problem! I didn't have any other plans for today anyway...

Snowsant:
I'm in Room 152! If there's anything else you need, Miss, you can come to me... Until my house is done being cleaned up, I'll be living here the whole time!

Hildegard:
Alright.

Eurill:
Ah, Cleric Hildegard, welcome.

Hildegard:
Mr. Eurill, the privilege is mine.

Eurill:
Not at all. Loosen up, Cleric Hildegard, we're not too fond of overly formal meetings in our corporate culture.

Hildegard:
Alright, then...

Eurill:
So. Regarding the business terms, coming from Landen Monastery to Lungmen—

Hildegard:
You're impressive. You had everything planned and prepared well in advance. Today was actually just to tell me about it all, wasn't it?

Eurill:
Nonsense.

Hildegard:
Truly perfect. With my current insight alone, I have no way to compare to you in terms of Messenger-related work.

Eurill:
Hah hah hah, it's my honor to get the seal of approval from a Laterano monastery cleric.

Hildegard:
Mr. Eurill, forgive me for being so bold, but I'd like to ask you a few personal questions.

Hildegard:
Why choose Landen Monastery?

Hildegard:
If a company with the heft of MountainDash Logistics seeks to open Messenger channels and refine its procedures...

Eurill:
Nonsense. We're deeply honored to be able to cooperate with an establishment as long and storied as Landen Monastery.

Hildegard:
......

Eurill:
—Do you know what the limit of my logistics company's reach is?

Hildegard:
What is it?

Eurill:
As proud as I am of MountainDash Logistics, it's got no footprint beyond Lungmen and the five cities of Yan around it.

Hildegard:
What about Ursus, or Victoria? Lungmen is a crucial outwards-facing hub for Yan, so shouldn't foreign...

Eurill:
Unlike what the average person on the street thinks, it's damned hard for a logistics company to operate anywhere outside of its country of registration.

Eurill:
Even with fully lawful transit, most civil logistics business still gets passed onto locally partnered Messenger orgs afterwards. Not a single country's so loose it'd let other nations' Messengers run free range on its own soil.

Eurill:
Of course... that's just 'over-the-table' modes of work, but we don't need to probe into any sort of gray area right about now. Don't you mind it.

Hildegard:
I see, then...

Eurill:
It's exactly as you say. For the stable setup of all kinds of information and transport hub links, the costs are—yes—not at all proportional to the profits the Monastery's goods bring in.

Eurill:
Even the cost of setting up a single Catastrophe Messenger base station'd blow your socks off.

Eurill:
However, this piece of business is a pathway connecting us to Laterano. I assume you understand what significance that holds.

Eurill:
This is only one blueprint amongst the things I wish to do, and at the very end of this pathway, Messengers will be able to overturn the barriers of culture and race. We can, with our own two hands, reach across this whole world.

Eurill:
I know, for all sorts of reasons, that in all probability this wouldn't come about. Race, culture, history, and from time to time Catastrophes adding to the mix.

Eurill:
Innumerous factors roiling around our strip of world have ensured the countries can't pull together as one.

Eurill:
Perhaps we must weather war, withstand Catastrophe. Perhaps this plan fundamentally cannot have a smooth ride within this split-up, estranged world of ours—

Eurill:
But that does not stand to forbid... the existence of bridges.

Eurill:
That being the case, we should try to part the great waves first.

Eurill:
By certain means, I've come to notice... the Apostle, the one and only, seems pretty open to this kind of thought exercise. Because of that, perhaps Laterano is our first step of a sorts in testing this new direction.

Hildegard:
......

Eurill:
Cleric Hildegard?

Hildegard:
No, sorry, I just never thought I'd be able to hear such things...

Hildegard:
Does your son know about this, erm, magnificent plan of yours?

Eurill:
Of course he doesn't. He still needs to polish himself. As I've said before, this project cannot be built in a day. I'm not the kind of person who rigs up bridges by his own hands. Maybe he is. Maybe, or maybe he isn't.

Eurill:
But he's my son, and that's enough.

Hildegard:
Landen Monastery will assuredly find it a valuable experience, working in conjunction with your firm.

Eurill:
The honor is all mine, Cleric Hildegard.

Hildegard:
To tell the truth, Mr. Eurill, my own way of thinking is very simplistic. I adore my convent, and I believe the exemplary culture of Landen Monastery deserves to continue on.

Hildegard:
And so, I pray this will not spell its end.

Hildegard:
In comparison to your hopes, our motives may seem somewhat self-centered now.

Eurill:
Absolutely not, Cleric Hildegard. It's no small thing, wholeheartedly taking in and cherishing the homeland you adore.

Eurill:
—And you don't need to worry if this'll bring the Monastery much trouble. Landen Monastery stands only as Landen Monastery, nothing more.

Hildegard:
Heheh, I didn't mean it like that. You have a lot on your mind, Mr. Eurill.

Eurill:
Nonsense. I should say that to you, Cleric Hildegard. Back when I was your age, I sure couldn't keep my head cool like yours.

Eurill:
It's gotten pretty late. We'll be getting a dinner party together for you tomorrow, Cleric Hildegard. Before that, you get some good shuteye.

Hildegard:
Well, that went smoothly. What a mighty fellow.

Hildegard:
But...

Hildegard:
Ugh, it feels like it's nothing to do with me now...

Just what can I do myself?

If only I knew.

Find some work? But how would I do that any faster...

Hildegard:
Wh—What... what's happening?

Sora:
Why does it turn out like this every time...?

Croissant:
Ya ain't used to it yet?

Sora:
Used to becoming the focus of everyone's attention because of some unexpected explosion while we're on the way to a job?

Croissant:
Slow down... I see him now! Thief! Get'cher behind back here!

Hildegard:
Oh, wow... is this really how you catch a thief...? I wonder what they stole that made it so serious...

Hildegard:
Who is it?

Snowsant:
It's me!

Hildegard:
Come in!

Snowsant:
Ah... I didn't disturb your rest, did I?

Hildegard:
Not at all. Is something the matter?

Snowsant:
It, it's just, um, I don't really know w-w-what to do on my own, because yesterday around this time I had my Miniature Cleaning Drone No. 23 to upgrade...

Hildegard:
No. 23?

Snowsant:
Ah, um, yes, that's right, since I wanted to try out an even simpler Originium circuit, but in the end I set the curtains on fire... and, um...

Snowsant:
*whimper*... I bought insurance... but now my card's balance is...

Hildegard:
A—Alright, it's okay, you actually came at a good time. Do you recognize those people down there?

Snowsant:
Down? Speaking of, it was really loud just now...

Sora:
Texas! They went your way.

Texas:
On 'em!

Snowsant:
Whoaaa... it's, it's all the Penguin Logistics girls...

Hildegard:
Ah. I think I've heard that name before.

Hildegard:
Is it in their nature to... er, drift across the road to head off a car?

Snowsant:
Uh, um, this happens often.

Hildegard:
It happens often, does it...

Hildegard:
Do you know their names?

Snowsant:
Huh? Um, I do actually see a lot of them, for work...

Snowsant:
The super handsome wolf who's driving, that's Texas. The really energetic lady chasing people with the hammer, she's Croissant...

Hildegard:
(Neither seem like real names. Maybe I ought to start thinking too...)

Snowsant:
Ah, the cute lady who's trying to intervene right now is Sora... she used to be a really famous idol, but I'm guessing monasteries don't really hear about that stuff?

Hildegard:
An idol?

Snowsant:
Yep, um, singer, star, that sort of idea.

Hildegard:
A star...

Hildegard:
The Monastery has its fair share of disciplines and taboos, but they aren't all that strict... at least, in the past few years, they haven't been.

Hildegard:
What does it feel like, to be a star?

Snowsant:
I'd like to know too...

Snowsant:
Ah, the inn's intercity net TV should have recordings of her concerts available to broadcast. Why not see for yourself...?

Hildegard:
The night's still young, after all.

Snowsant:
Th, then let's take a look... uh... you have to pay... oh? This one's a free program...

Truthfully, I've thought about it before.

Thought about the world outside, if it was nothing like I'd ever seen before.

Hildegard:
......

Hildegard:
Ah, it's so late already—

Snowsant:
Zzz... zzz...

Hildegard:
Oh my...

Hildegard:
My apologies... good night, Snowsant.

Hildegard:
Yaawwn—

Hildegard:
Watching it actually woke me up...

Hildegard:
TV, huh. The Monastery, I think, had a TV of its own...

Hildegard:
Through such a little rectangle, you can see across the whole world...

Hildegard:
...An idol...

Hildegard:
No-no-no-what in Heaven's name am I thinking—

Hildegard:
Hm...

Hildegard:
A Kazimierz Knight. That might not be too bad either... but those Majors always make you feel like something's off... if I have the chance, I should go see one.

Hildegard:
Leithanien's Casters seem very well-regarded. I remember Angelica going off to Leithanien after she'd finished with us. I think she was pursuing further study at a music conservatory...?

Hildegard:
Sigh.

Hildegard:
The stars in the sky are so clear tonight.

???:
The poets give the stars their words, the vagrants bare their million thoughts to the night. And me, I've already decided which star up there's gonna have my name.

Emperor:
Evenin', sister.

Hildegard:
A—And you are?

Emperor:
Oh, I saw you comin' outta my bar a minute ago. I was wrappin' up a little accident, see.

Hildegard:
Er... Isn't that MountainDash Logistics's...

Emperor:
Eurill? Dumbass cow bought it and won't give it back, but you know what I'm sayin', I'm still that place's one and only bartender! I'm its soul!

Hildegard:
......

Emperor:
Oh... hold up, hold up.

Emperor:
What? A fake? You got duped?

Emperor:
Then what're you waitin' for? Give their boat some fireworks! Yeah! That's what I said! What? 'course you gotta take me! What, you gonna leave me out?!

Hildegard:
(No matter what this is, it has to be illegal, right—?!)

Emperor:
What did Eurill tell you?

Hildegard:
Why would I—

Emperor:
Nah, I know. Could only be gettin' some more hands on board, lookin' for a way out. Peace be to him.

Emperor:
It's a helluva world, shorty.

Hildegard:
Why are you just—

Emperor:
But the way I see it now, you gotta think a little bigger.

Emperor:
Don't you worry, you're pretty easy on the eyes. My eyes. Even Paul Landen, handsome ass. I like it when he puts down his gun and picks up a pen!

Texas:
Found them, boss.

Hildegard:
Wait—

Emperor:
Waiting's a sucker's game! We got fools to huck in the river!

Hildegard:
Um...

Hildegard:
Paul Landen... the founder of the Monastery? What in the world was that strange little person trying...

Hildegard:
What a brave new world.

Hildegard:
Mr. Eurill, you'll have to forgive my manners, but before I leave Lungmen, there's something I must ask you.

Eurill:
By all means.

Hildegard:
Why are you always in this bar?

Eurill:
Hah hah hah... I only just bought this place out from an acquaintance of mine. I quite fancy the atmosphere. It's not loud, it's not dirty, it's well-lit and strikes a vivid look.

Eurill:
Bars don't usually come like this, at least not in Lungmen. I don't know about Laterano... but I guess you probably don't see clerics in bars.

Hildegard:
It's not the total truth. Sundays in the convent's dormitories fundamentally aren't that different from a bar.

Eurill:
Hah hah, I think I understand now, why it is you and I can chat.

Eurill:
But the most important thing is, at some point, all of a sudden, I became very enamored with this bar's name—

Eurill:
—'The Ends of the Earth.'

Eurill:
At this very moment, we're at 'The Ends of the Earth.'

Hildegard:
...I see, then.

Eurill:
Well, to this project bringing the ideal to fruition. Cheers.

Hildegard:
Cheers.

Eurill:
When are you setting off?

Hildegard:
The plan was for tomorrow morning at nine.

Eurill:
Oh... did the plan change?

Hildegard:
My mind changed.

Eurill:
Then regardless of what you're planning to do, will you need the assistance of our Messengers?

Hildegard:
I won't. I didn't leave the Monastery this time just for one or two odds and ends, after all.

Hildegard:
What's more important is, I'm going to find where I can expand on my own faith.

Eurill:
I see. You've reached a conclusion?

Hildegard:
Hmm...

Hildegard:
I'm hard-pressed to say it's a conclusion...

Hildegard:
But...

Hildegard:
I'd love to see more of it. The world out there is... truthfully, a little more fascinating than I'd thought.

Eurill:
Now that's an answer with some youthful pep. I've got a small question too, and I'd like to seek a cleric's guidance.

Hildegard:
You flatter me. Please, ask away.

Eurill:
Do you think... that our project, even in the future, will truly be given others' recognition? Do you think the other voices of Laterano might stand on the other side to us?

Hildegard:
The value of things shouldn't be decided prior to their coming. At the very least, we can choose to have some respect for all things and all creatures.

Eurill:
Is that a principle of the Monastery, too?

Hildegard:
Just Laterano nature. For that matter, Mr. Eurill, did you just want to test the present attitude of Landen Monastery?

Eurill:
Nonsense. I'm just curious what kind of heart my current collaborators bring to their work.

Eurill:
Obviously, I wouldn't doubt my own business. Thing is, once some things get beyond the scope of business, I have to start minding what other people think.

Eurill:
How do you see it?

Hildegard:
Landen Monastery tells a fable.

Hildegard:
They say, in a certain church in Laterano, there was a vast mural, depicting a story of heroes in ancient times, fighting for their faith.

Hildegard:
Artists, from all over, all came to examine this mural. Some praised, some criticized, some chose to keep a rational quiet.

Hildegard:
—Then, from a small little quarter of Leithanien, came an upstart.

Hildegard:
The upstart was bloated, and unwilling to climb the church's stairs, thereupon he gazed at the church's window from afar. Through that window, he sighted a single deformed, vile beast in the artwork.

Hildegard:
And immediately, this businessman began to slander the mural, first saying that the hallowed and pure Laterano had produced such repulsive paintings, downright immoral.

Hildegard:
Soon after, he spoke that even this single vile beast had a great many imperfections in the art.

Eurill:
Vile beast?

Hildegard:
Little did he realize that what he saw was not a vile beast in the mural, but a church ornament and a candleholder's silhouette, which by misfortune had given him such a mistaken impression.

Hildegard:
He couldn't even step into the grand church, yet dismantling what he saw in that superficial fragment, he came to an insight more superficial still.

Hildegard:
Where do you think the problem arose from?

Eurill:
—Arrogance, and prejudice.

Hildegard:
So this fable is named 'La Bestia Superba.' If you should ask 'why did the church construct so high of a staircase?', that was indeed an arrogance in itself.

Hildegard:
What you want to do—that is to shatter all arrogance, or at the least, between every country, every land, every race's inharmonious arrogances, find a path, through the life mission of a Messenger.

Hildegard:
And between those, you even include the very arrogance of nature and life itself—Catastrophes.

Hildegard:
In realistic terms, I feel it will be very hard.

Eurill:
Someone's always got to be that stepping stone.

Hildegard:
This has eased my heart some.  When we're meant to talk money, we should talk it. But here, with you, Mr. Eurill, we're certainly talking of more than just money...

Hildegard:
We're talking of quite a fair project. I feel a deep admiration for your ability to run things.

Eurill:
Hah hah hah, if that's how you think, then I'm completely and utterly relieved.

Eurill:
If you have the chance, why not take that son of mine on a trip to Laterano.

Hildegard:
But of course.

Eurill:
After all, ever since he came into contact with Mostima, I can see in his eyes, his idea of a 'Messenger' has grown a lot less narrow. Not bad—hm? What's that look for?

Hildegard:
I feel like I've heard a name I can't quite let pass.

Eurill:
Oh? Was she that famous? I thought her reputation was pretty internal to the Messenger biz.

Hildegard:
Well, ever since she was exiled, I haven't heard more about her, really.

Hildegard:
Sankta can live very good lives wherever they are. After all, they're Sankta.

Eurill:
Hah hah, true words.

Eurill:
Right, Emperor wanted me to give you this.

Hildegard:
Um? Emperor?

Eurill:
A very tenacious guy. He does everything off-script, but make no mistake, he's reliable.

Hildegard:
This is... a contact address? Is this a... company?

Hildegard:
Rho... Rhodes Island... Is that how you read it?

Eurill:
Ah... once in a while, you trust Emperor's taste in associates. And you can trust me, they and this strip of world are marvelous one and the same.
