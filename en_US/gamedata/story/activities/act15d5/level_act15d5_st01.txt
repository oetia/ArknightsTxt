Hoshiguma:
(Yawn)

Hoshiguma:
Fold the blankets into dougan, and that'll do.

Hoshiguma:
Wallet, keys, jacket...

Hoshiguma:
I'll... leave the comms gear.

Hoshiguma:
Shield... leave that too. You rest easy for today, partner.

Hoshiguma:
I'll kick these for shoes. Mmm. Nope, don't feel it. Maybe this limited edition pair? Ah, these feel pretty right. They match my outfit today.

Hoshiguma:
......

Hoshiguma:
Eh, let's go with the first ones after all.

Swire:
(Rolls eyes)

Hoshiguma:
Missy, perfect timing. Which pair do you think looks best?

Swire:
Don't ask. Every part of you looks awful to me right now.

Hoshiguma:
What's wrong? You're in a rotten mood. Special day today?

Swire:
Ngaang gau ah, nei!

Swire:
You were pounding on my door at dawn for this?! So I could watch you count SHOES? You've collected a billion pairs that all look basically the same to me!

Hoshiguma:
How are they the same? They're all different editions, the materials are all different... ugh, what am I doing telling you this.

Hoshiguma:
Our dorms are next to each other. We're like neighbors. We help each other out.

Swire:
Like I care about you!

Swire:
Let me make this clear to you, today is my day off! It's three minutes to six right now, and if I sound this alarm, I can write you up for disturbing the peace!

Swire:
You want overtime? Fine! Do it yourself! You're gonna lose your hair working 24/7, but don't try to take my locks too!

Hoshiguma:
Overtime nothing. Not often we get a day off, and the L.G.D. doesn't pay much more for overtime. They're pretty tight-pursed. I'm no workaholic like Ch'en either.

Hoshiguma:
And Missy, are you one to talk? Didn't you just come back from the L.G.D.? I heard you opening and slamming the door. That one traveled.

Swire:
Piss off! I'm so done right now!

Swire:
Our plate's loaded! We've got the mess Reunion left, we've got business with that stinky old rat... and that puk gaai Lung isn't even here when it matters. What DOESN'T need doing?

Swire:
You got promoted, and they want you transferred? Transferred where? Are we just going to give the Special Inspection Unit to someone else?!

Swire:
I've had it up to HERE!

Hoshiguma:
Calm down, calm down. It's not like Mr. Wei hasn't thought it through. He's training you.

Hoshiguma:
For when the L.G.D. is your responsibility. If you ask me, it's just a matter of time.

Hoshiguma:
You can do it.

Swire:
You... you don't need to tell me! Of course I know that already!

Swire:
Bâ€”But she was supposed to take over the L.G.D... She was groomed for it...

Swire:
......

Hoshiguma:
*Sigh*. Don't you go crying again.

Swire:
Who's crying?!

Swire:
Just you wait. Who cares if some smelly dragon never comes back. Sooner or later I'll seize the L.G.D. for myself. All of it, just you wait.

Hoshiguma:
Ha ha, now that's something to look forward to.

Swire:
Ugh. No, wait. Did you just say you heard me opening the door when I came back? So you knew I hadn't slept all night?

Swire:
Then why the hell did you still call me over? You said you didn't do it on purpose!

Hoshiguma:
Hey, hey, don't get worked up.

Hoshiguma:
I was worried you were pushing yourself too hard. Been a lot happening lately, and we haven't really gotten the chance to meet up, right?

Hoshiguma:
Here, I bet you skipped breakfast again, right? I bought some breakfast. It's your favorite chow fun. Eat a little before you go to sleep.

Swire:
Hmph. Didn't ask you to.

Hoshiguma:
Fine, fine, you didn't ask me to. Will you still eat it?

Swire:
Of course I will! Give it!

Swire:
Hey, why'd you buy two portions? How am I gonna finish this much?

Hoshiguma:
Oh... that was two? Must've been habit. Bought them without thinking.

Swire:
......

Swire:
Three-mushroom shredded fowl, saa sin sauce, extra starchroot... Hmph, only that dummy would like it this way.

Swire:
Their place uses pretty boring noodles. The flavor's too bland, they skimp on the ingredients. It's barely passable. Next time, remember: go downstairs from the L.G.D., turn the corner, second house down with the blue sign hung outside. They do better stuff.

Hoshiguma:
Fine, I get it, I'll get you theirs next time. Just try and eat some for now. Woah, slow down! You don't have to inhale it.

Swire:
(Yawn)

Swire:
Oh, yeah, where are you going today? I'm up already, so you may as well count me in for some window-shopping.

Swire:
I need to go buy that one Svrrovski piece. The new one from the JOKER series. It came out just last week.

Hoshiguma:
Oh, the one Ch'en's had her eye on since forever ago?

Swire:
Yep, that one. She's got a pretty good eye for those. She's better at picking out clothes and jewelry than I am.

Hoshiguma:
Sounds like a compliment to me.

Hoshiguma:
Personally, I don't even get to wear that kinda jewelry much after I buy it. Good thing she gets paid enough, and she lives in a free L.G.D. dorm. She'd be in dire straits otherwise.

Hoshiguma:
Anyway, Missy, you're inviting me? That's pretty rare. Is this the first time ever?

Swire:
If I had anyone else, you think I'd wanna pick you?

Hoshiguma:
I guess so. Whoa, actually, if I don't head out now I'll be late. Later.

Swire:
Wait, going where? Hold on, I'm gonna do my makeup!

Hoshiguma:
Don't. You're plenty fine even without making up, 'Miss.'

Hoshiguma:
Thanks for inviting me, but I'll have to pass today. I'm just going out for a spin, not much point in tagging along. I'll pick you up next time.

Hoshiguma:
Get some sleep. Leave those bags under your eyes for too long, and it'll be rough when you finally wanna get them off.

Hoshiguma:
You need more rest, Swire, you really do.

L.G.D. Officer:
Madame, good morning!

Hoshiguma:
Morning. You've all worked enough. Want some breakfast? I got recommended a place, so I picked some up along the way.

Hoshiguma:
Seriously, this early on a vacation day and I still see so many people in this building.

L.G.D. Officer:
Ever since that whole incident, it's been like this non-stop, ugh.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
Same goes for you, Madame Hoshiguma. You only left a few hours ago and now you're back. You're off today, if I remember?

Hoshiguma:
No comparison. Things are different for me.

Hoshiguma:
Forget that, are you really still okay? I feel like you're wobbling... Eat something, and lie down in the lounge for a bit. Lay off the energy drinks. They're not good for you.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
Ah, thank you, Madame. But I'm okay. Once I'm done with the work I've got on hand, I can go home and sleep.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
(Yawn)

Hoshiguma:
Fine. I won't say much more then. Just mind yourself.

Hoshiguma:
It's been all hands on deck lately. After we're past this, I'll take you all out for a feast.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
A feast? I'll pass. What I want is a raise.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
Two days ago I ran into the guy from that Rhodes Island office, flaunting his promotion in front of me... pah, what's to flaunt? You just get a few more vacation days than I do...

L.G.D. Officer:
...Rhodes Island?

L.G.D. Officer:
The ones who worked with us? And the lot who took Madame Ch'en away?!

L.G.D. Officer:
I thought those guys scrammed ages ago!

Hoshiguma:
Ah... you mean that local branch of theirs, right?

Hoshiguma:
I think they do some recruitment too. Weren't there a few youngsters making trouble in the streets who got talked into picking up some work instead?

Hoshiguma:
They've got a way with words.

Hoshiguma:
Don't you go stirring trouble for them. It's all Lungmen citizens working in that office. No picking bones.

Hoshiguma:
Go back and tell the kiddos downstairs too. No getting mixed up.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
The hell I can. Everyone's clear deep down.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
Us and Rhodes Island get along fine enough. Once in a blue moon we'll have drinks together.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
They've got plenty of weirdos there, and besides their local office people, you pass by them now and again on the street. Some just look wild. We can't help but stare a bit.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
Last week they had some kind of Laterano monastery girl with them... and not to mention they can all hold their liquor.

L.G.D. Officer:
Huh?! So the time you came back dead drunk, it was Rhodes who got you like that?! You threw up all over me!

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
Uh... did that happen?

L.G.D. Officer:
Damn right it did!

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
Fine, fine, my bad. Next time you file for a day off to go on a date with your girlfriend, I'll approve it, okay?

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
Just hang in there until this bump's over, and every district we're rebuilding has its reconstruction schedules all sorted out. Then we'll be good.

L.G.D. Officer:
Of course I know that... Honestly, though, once this bump's over, I'm probably not gonna have a girlfriend anymore... *sigh*.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
Hey, that works out. Won't need to approve your day off.

Hoshiguma:
Brutal. If you don't have anything nice to say...

L.G.D. Officer:
He's just like that. I'm used to it.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
Brat.

Exhausted L.G.D. Officer:
Anyway, Madame, same to you. It's your day off. Don't hang around here, go on back and take a break pronto.

L.G.D. Officer:
Yeah, just leave things here to us!

Hoshiguma:
Oh, looks like I'm not that popular. Or is there another reason you're trying to shoo me out here?

L.G.D. Officer:
N-No, that's not what I mean...!

Hoshiguma:
Ha ha, alright, relax, I'm joking. I just came in to have a look, and drop off some food on the side.

Hoshiguma:
Here, chow fun. You get to it, then. I'm leaving.

Hoshiguma:
Whew, I'm tired.

Hoshiguma:
I've only been up for a few days, and I'm already starting to buckle. Getting off-kilter.

Hoshiguma:
I'm not getting old, right? Shouldn't be, I'm still young if I think about it hard enough...

Hoshiguma:
......

Hoshiguma:
Maybe I am?

Hoshiguma:
Ha, whatever...

Hoshiguma:
Hey, partner, what do you think? It's been a while since I gave you some exercise. Let's head out to that racetrack in Ngai Kang and give it a spin, feel the breeze.

Hoshiguma:
Hey, your exhaust sounds a little off today. Don't tell me you're getting old too?

Hoshiguma:
No, of course not, you're definitely still latest model. 70vv.

Hoshiguma:
Though I guess a model even newer than you just came out. Steady and smooth, fast as lightning. Their ads have always been pretty good, haven't they?

Hoshiguma:
I still wanna get my hands on one to try, but they break the bank. It's okay, partner, we'll put up with each other for a bit. My wages aren't that high. Can't always spend like I did on you.

Hoshiguma:
You're far from out of date, and I'm far from retirement. We match pretty well, don't we?

Hoshiguma:
......

Hoshiguma:
What's your opinion? What makes Ch'en so hard to crack?

Hoshiguma:
Think she can get used to Rhodes Island? Is she gonna get into fights? I'm guessing so. It's not like she can't get along with people, it's just if she's not willing...

???:
Nay.

Hoshiguma:
â€”Who's there!?

Shirayuki:
Miss Ch'en is no fossilized bonehead.

Shirayuki:
Nor blindly headstrong.

Hoshiguma:
Ah, who's there? You're... Lady Shirayuki.

Shirayuki:
(Nods)

Shirayuki:
Madame Hoshiguma.

Hoshiguma:
I don't need the title. How come you're here, Lady Shirayuki?

Shirayuki:
The Madam is away. My orders, to protect thee.

Hoshiguma:
Got it.

Hoshiguma:
Lady Shirayuki, I heard the Madam recently assigned you to Rhodes Island?

Hoshiguma:
How is it? Is little Amiya still holding up? And the Doctor by her side... I remember that one sticking behind cover giving orders. Freakishly smart, freakishly tired. How are they all now?

Shirayuki:
In plentiful vigor, spirits held high.

Shirayuki:
Raucous blather.

Shirayuki:
Loud sort.

Hoshiguma:
Ha ha ha ha, sounds like they're still full of beans.

Hoshiguma:
It seems like you have a pretty nice impression of Rhodes Island, Lady Shirayuki.

Shirayuki:
Truly, Rhodes Island is agreeable.

Shirayuki:
As goes for Miss Ch'en.

Shirayuki:
...Thou needn't dwell.

Hoshiguma:
What, so now even Lady Shirayuki's saying it... You're not telling me I've got worry written across my entire face? Seriously?

Hoshiguma:
That can't be right. If I was like that, Missy would've torn a layer off my face this morning.

Shirayuki:
......

Hoshiguma:
It's okay, Lady Shirayuki. I'm not worried about Ch'en, that's the truth.

Hoshiguma:
Truest truth. Don't judge Ch'en by her cover. Sure, she'll snap like whiplash, but she's got a delicate heart in there.

Hoshiguma:
I didn't see it coming when I first met her all the way back. Only came to realize after being with her a lot more. I believe as long as she has a brick wall to bash her head against, she'll live decent no matter where it is.

Shirayuki:
Intelligent and sharp-witted is Miss Ch'en.

Shirayuki:
Tongue incisive, and her action ne'er pales.

Shirayuki:
The commonfolk cannot hope to cheat her.

Hoshiguma:
Ha ha, true that.

Hoshiguma:
Tell me, where do you find someone like her? Piss her off and she'll switch to chewing people out, and as long as there's reason, she'll chew out anyone. I've never seen her scared before.

Shirayuki:
Miss Ch'en... is unreserved.

Hoshiguma:
Honestly, Ch'en's temper hasn't changed once in all these years.

Hoshiguma:
I've always felt she put a lot of stress on chivalry. In those manga about master swordsmen, her sort would be the main character.

Hoshiguma:
But, you know, blood and gore's fun enough to read about, but having those wounds on your own body really aches something fierce.

Hoshiguma:
There are times I see her aching beyond help, and I think, is it really worth this?

Hoshiguma:
It isn't worth it. In truth, in full honesty, I feel it truly isn't worth it.

Hoshiguma:
But she thinks it is.

Hoshiguma:
I'm not worried if she comes to grief. A little grief is no bad thing. Get too strong-willed and you'll come to a lot worse.

Hoshiguma:
I'm just scared that she can't get over it. That she can't let it go.

Shirayuki:
......

Shirayuki:
Miss Ch'en's soul is wide.

Shirayuki:
Rid of her chest's weight, she is ever more unstoppable.

Hoshiguma:
You see clearly, Lady Shirayuki. And Master Wei and the Madam see even more plainly.

Shirayuki:
You too, Madame Hoshiguma, are chivalrous.

Hoshiguma:
Me? Stop it, that's over the top now. I'm clear when it comes to myself.

Hoshiguma:
When I was young, I didn't know how things worked. I dreamed, of course, too.

Hoshiguma:
I've done a lot of impulsive things, and it's not like I've never had some hot blood in me.

Hoshiguma:
But the hot-blooded story's over, the kid's no longer a kid, and now what? They wouldn't write this stuff in a story. Write it and the readers'd get mad. Total waste of effort. Save yourself the trouble of ever writing it.

Hoshiguma:
Stories get to end at the best possible times. Life doesn't.

Hoshiguma:
If chivalry looked like me, carrying the weight of the world, then people wouldn't be into it.

Shirayuki:
One cannot undervalue oneself.

Shirayuki:
......

Shirayuki:
If you may see this.

Hoshiguma:
This is... a comic?

Shirayuki:
Tai Kam Road, Second Lane bookstore. This month's new publication.

Shirayuki:
A present for thee.

Hoshiguma:
Really unexpected.

Hoshiguma:
Much thanks. Though I'm surprised. You read this, Lady Shirayuki?

Shirayuki:
Madame will know at a gloss.

Shirayuki:
Then. I, Shirayuki, take my leave.

Hoshiguma:
......

Hoshiguma:
(This series...)

Hoshiguma:
(A new artist's debut work. Second overall in readers' support, and other artists have been recommending it...)

Hoshiguma:
(It seems pretty decent, too. Is this the protagonist on the cover?)

Hoshiguma:
(Kinda... familiar...)

Hoshiguma:
(......)

Hoshiguma:
(This big one holding the shield is...)

Hoshiguma:
Ah, ha. So that's how it is. No wonder.

Hoshiguma:
They've got some guts. But they still know their work. Art's not bad, too.

Hoshiguma:
Whatever. Whatâ€”ever...

Hoshiguma:
If I ever see Ch'en again, what should I call her?

Hoshiguma:
Operator Ch'en?

Hoshiguma:
Hm...

Hoshiguma:
Pretty good. Pretty fitting, too.

Hoshiguma:
......

Hoshiguma:
(Still not fast enough.)

Hoshiguma:
(Got a curve up ahead. Perfect, I can still kick up a gear.)

The one-horned Oni lets out her breath.

It's been a long time since she sped through the wind so savagely. With every roar her beloved machine lets out beneath her, her young, brazen blood seems to flow again, in speed for its own sake.

â€”Until suddenly, behind her, sounds another mechanical beast's cries.

The L.G.D.'s Madame Hoshiguma comes back to her senses.

Hoshiguma:
Mm?

Hoshiguma:
(Who is it...?)

Hoshiguma:
(The sound's coming from behind, and getting closer.)

Hoshiguma:
Pretty good speed, catching up to me.

Hoshiguma:
Heh, that model and that engine's sound. It's the latest one in the ads. Odds are it's modified, too.

Hoshiguma:
Let's burn some rubber, partner. We can't lose.

Hoshiguma:
(Strange. When was there someone so good, and how did I never know?)

Hoshiguma:
(And they kind of seem like...)

Hoshiguma:
('Tearing the vacant streets in the dead of night, the ghost driver in the flashes on the winding roads.')

Hoshiguma:
(Wait, but the vehicle's not right. And I think I know who's driving it..)

Hoshiguma:
...No way?

Hoshiguma:
...Phew.

Hoshiguma:
You're good. It's my loss.

Fumizuki:
I'm flattered. You took that curve very well. Had my machine not been somewhat better, I would never have overtaken.

Fumizuki:
Good morning, Inspector Hoshiguma.

Hoshiguma:
You're unbeatable, Madam Fumizuki.

Fumizuki:
Oh, my. You don't seem surprised at all.

Hoshiguma:
I'm pretty surprised, actually. It was too fast just before. I only dared to guess it was you after that curve.

Hoshiguma:
Everyone's familiar with your principal vehicle, Madam, I'd never mistake it. Today's the first time I've seen those wheels, though.

Fumizuki:
Are you going to issue me a speeding ticket, then?

Hoshiguma:
Of course I couldn't. This racecourse is outside our jurisdiction, anyway, specifically for racing... If tickets were a thing out here, I wouldn't get away with it either.

Fumizuki:
Hehe. You've all been working terribly hard.

Hoshiguma:
That's our job. Nothing terrible about it.

Hoshiguma:
......

Fumizuki:
What's wrong, Inspector Hoshiguma? You seem like there's still something you want to say.

Hoshiguma:
Eh... nothing much.

Hoshiguma:
Just thinking, the wind out here feels really nice.

Hoshiguma:
Flooring down an accelerator sure does wonders for my mood.

Fumizuki:
Quite right. Hear, hear!

Fumizuki:
In times with just too much to try and do, it truly feels a lot better once you've taken in the breeze.

Fumizuki:
Though that can't be all you wanted to say, can it?

Hoshiguma:
Huh... I guess there's no hiding it from you, Madam.

Hoshiguma:
I was just thinkingâ€”

Hoshiguma:
The Stream-35LL Luminous Luxury parked downstairs from Master Wei for the last two days, even though he doesn't seem like the biking type. Sure enough, it was never his.
