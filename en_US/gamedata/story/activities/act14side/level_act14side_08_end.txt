Degenbrecher:
Do you come from the Court of Sargon?

Sharp:
That was my previous employment.

Sharp:
Never thought you'd be able to identify Sargon swordsmanship.

Degenbrecher:
I have little interest in Arts. But when it comes to weaponry, I couldn't forget anything, even if I wanted to.

Sharp:
No wonder they called The Black Knight a natural-born warrior.

Degenbrecher:
Natural-born?

Degenbrecher:
Hmph.

Degenbrecher:
Do you know how long it took to go from 'a Leithanian who can't use Arts' to 'a natural-born warrior?'

Sharp:
Do you have no sense of pain?

Degenbrecher:
If growing up, the only waking sensation you knew was pain, then you too would be used to it.

Degenbrecher:
How about you? How many times have you danced with death?

Sharp:
Everyone I knew who even thought of counting didn't survive long in battle.

Sharp:
I heard that The Black Knight, despite being a three-time champion, was exiled from Kazimierz and hunted for refusing to work with the General Chamber of Commerce, eventually disappearing beyond Kazimierz's borders.

Degenbrecher:
So?

Sharp:
Once a symbol of refusal to bow to authority, now a conspirator's bodyguard taking part in the usurpation of a country.

Sharp:
I don't pass any moral judgments. I just can't help but to feel a bit let down.

Degenbrecher:
I thought a Rhodes Islander of all people would understand Enciodes's ideas.

Sharp:
Understanding is one thing. Acceptance is another.

Sharp:
Actually, I think the Doctor understands Enciodes well.

Degenbrecher:
I'm not going to defend Enciodes or myself. It's too much of a hassle, and also unnecessary.

Degenbrecher:
See for yourself what he wants with your own eyes – if you survive, that is.

After a great many struggles, Ensia finally reaches the edge of the cliff. She can scale it easily, but the sound of a nearby conversation makes her freeze.

Silverash Clan Warrior A:
Everything's gone to shit down there, and everything's gone to shit up here too.

Silverash Clan Warrior B:
Yeah. I can't believe the Great Elder went down like that, and now Arctosz is rampaging his way up here.

Silverash Clan Warrior A:
I was under the assumption that the worst was over, but now I have no idea what's going to happen next.

Silverash Clan Warrior B:
I didn't really think there'd be peace anyway, but now that things have gone south, I feel a little guilty.

Silverash Clan Warrior A:
Guilty? Why?

Silverash Clan Warrior B:
Since we entered the Vine-Bear Court, the Lady–– Err, the Saintess, has clearly taken the reins.

Silverash Clan Warrior B:
Since the Great Elder collapsed, the entire Vine-Bear Court has fallen in line with the Saintess.

Silverash Clan Warrior B:
And below the mountain, Sir Enciodes has taken complete control.

Silverash Clan Warrior A:
......

Silverash Clan Warrior A:
When you put it that way, it all makes sense, huh. The Saintess controls the mountain, and Sir Enciodes controls everything below.

Silverash Clan Warrior B:
Borrowing your words, I have no idea what's going to happen next.

Silverash Clan Warrior A:
We're just underlings anyway. There's no point thinking too hard about it.

Silverash Clan Warrior B:
Yeah, you're right. Why even bother?

Silverash Clan Warrior B:
Let's make two more rounds. Maybe we'll get called down the mountain by then.

Ensia:
Sis...

Silverash Clan Warrior C:
Hey! What's that?!

Silverash Clan Warrior D:
The granary is on fire!

Silverash Clan Warrior C:
What?! Someone go put it out, hurry!

Sciurus:
Heh, piece of cake.

Browntail Clan Warrior:
Madame, you certainly have a unique way of doing things, though that's to be expected...

Sciurus:
The hell are you trying to say?!

Browntail Clan Warrior:
N-Nothing, it was a compliment.

Sciurus:
Hmph. I'll pay for them to rebuild the granary after we're all done here, but for now, we're on urgent business!

Sciurus:
Stop dragging your feet! The fire's got their attention, so go rescue Yucatan! The place is right ahead!

Browntail Clan Warrior:
Yes, Madame!

Enya:
...Kjarr.

Kjarr:
I'm here, Saintess.

Enya:
During the ceremony, I recall that when I happened to spot you in the crowd, there was a hooded figure next to you.

Kjarr:
That's right.

Enya:
I've heard that this person is a guest from Rhodes Island invited by Enciodes. A guest known as the Doctor.

Enya:
But now, that individual stands with Arctosz, fighting against Enciodes.

Kjarr:
...Nothing escapes you, Saintess.

Enya:
How did you come to know this person?

Kjarr:
By chance, when I was heading down the mountain to deliver your letter.

Enya:
...I'll take your word for it then.

Kjarr:
Why did this question suddenly grip your thoughts?

Enya:
......

Enya:
I would like to meet this person.

Kjarr:
Huh?

Enya:
Though I don't know exactly why, the Doctor stands in direct opposition to Enciodes.

Enya:
I want to know exactly why.

Kjarr:
......

Enya:
I no longer doubt what I must do, but I am afraid that I made up my mind too late.

Enya:
There are some things I must fight for.

Kjarr:
About that... You needn't worry yourself.

Enya:
Why not?

Kjarr:
Because the Doctor's emissary is right behind you.

Enya:
Huh?!

Ensia:
Sis!

Enya:
Ensia... I suppose I've finally started hallucinating.

Ensia:
Snap out of it, sis! You're not hallucinating! It's me, your sister, Ensia!

Enya:
What?! Ensia, is that really you?

Ensia:
It is! Here, come touch me if you don't believe it.

Enya:
......!

Enya wants to reach out with her shaking hands to feel Ensia.

She fears that the sister who suddenly appeared before her is an illusion.

But before she has a chance to do so, Ensia has already plunged into her arms.

She knows right away, without a shadow of a doubt, that the woman embracing her is her dearest little sister.

Enya:
......

Enya:
It's you, Ensia... It really is you...

Ensia:
I've missed you so much.

Enya:
I've missed you too.

Enya:
Have you been well?

Enya:
What of your illness?

Enya:
What kind of place is this Rhodes Island?

Ensia:
You're so silly. You already asked all these things in your letters.

Ensia:
I have to tell you...

Sharp takes a few steps back with a shallow breath.

He has fought many opponents throughout his career, and has also learned from – or at least watched – many formidable fighters at Rhodes Island.

But he has to admit – he has never faced anyone like Degenbrecher before. Or rather, an opponent as pure and simple as Degenbrecher.

She has speed and strength, qualities that every warrior should possess.

Degenbrecher has nothing more, but clearly needs nothing more.

Why would anyone need anything more than incredible speed and strength?

Fortunately... Sharp became an elite operator because he also possesses these two things.

Sharp:
......

Degenbrecher:
......

Sharp:
You have a lot of trust in Enciodes.

Degenbrecher:
What makes you say that?

Sharp:
Few people have the capacity to do this for money.

Sharp:
And besides, you are not a person who can be won over with money.

Degenbrecher:
What about you? You said this is just business, but what you've done goes well beyond duty.

Sharp:
I assure you, the work I do is the work I like.

Degenbrecher:
...I didn't like Kazimierz. Too chaotic, and the people are too loud.

Degenbrecher:
I thought I wouldn't like Kjerag either.

Degenbrecher:
But Kjerag isn't too bad.

Sharp:
That's a fair reason. Having a nice place to retire is important.

As if reaching a tacit agreement, the two sides take a few steps back.

They both realize that their previous moves achieved nothing toward the goal of eliminating the opponent.

They would have to tap into more of their power.

Degenbrecher casts her sword aside, and pulls the swordbreakers from her waist.

Sharp likewise discards his shield and holds his knife with both hands.

An evergreen tree branch buckles under the weight of the snow with a crackling sound.

In the same instant, Sharp and Degenbrecher both vanish from where they were just a second ago.

Enya:
Honestly, what am I going to do with you?

Enya:
You actually managed to sneak past everyone and climb all the way up from the foot of the mountain.

Ensia:
Heheh, it was the only way for me to see you.

Enya:
You were just saying a certain 'the Doctor' sent you up here?

Enya:
To what end?

Ensia:
The Doctor told me I should stay by your side, protect you when you need it, or help you escape.

Enya:
When I need it?

Ensia:
Yeah, like if our brother tries to do something bad to you.

Enya:
......

Ensia:
I...

Ensia:
Okay, this is what I think.

Ensia:
He has his ideas, and I can't stop him.

Ensia:
But if those ideas end up putting you in danger...

Ensia:
I'll put my life on the line to stop him.

Enya:
......

Enya suddenly understands why the Doctor sent her sister to her side.

For protection. For a way out. These are the two reasons told to Ensia.

But the Doctor also knows about her ideals, as well as the fact that being able to see her sister would be inherently meaningful.

Have Ensia protect her?

Have Ensia help her escape?

No, quite the opposite.

She is the one who should protect Ensia.

She is the one who should help Ensia escape.

She is the one –– who should be fighting.

Enya:
Ensia, I see you're still wearing the bracelet I made for you.

Ensia:
Of course. And I'll keep wearing it.

Enya:
I'll find the time to make a new one for you.

Ensia:
Really?!

Enya:
Mmhmm.

Enya:
So, Ensia...

Ensia:
Yeah?

Enya:
Do you want to do a little favor for me?

Ensia:
A favor?

Enya:
Come with me.

Yucatan:
......

Yucatan:
(It's awfully quiet outside, but there should still be two guards.)

Yucatan:
(The window... If I don't want them to see me from this angle, I have to lead the guards away first.)

Yucatan:
(The patrol route... They pass through this area five times a day, and should be coming around soon.)

Yucatan:
(No, I can't force open the lock... But if I can pick it...)

Yucatan:
(...Then there might still be a chance.)

Young Guard:
Sir Enciodes... This time I swear...

Yucatan:
(––They're coming!)

Young Guard:
The conflict... three clans seems inevitable, but...

Older Guard:
...Browntail clan's... burning... Sciurus...

Yucatan:
(Sciurus...?!)

Yucatan:
(Why did they mention Rus? Did something happen to her?!)

Yucatan:
(Dammit, I'm still too far away... I can't hear clearly.)

Yucatan:
(No, she can handle herself. I have to find a way out of here first, then find Sciurus and the Matriarch...)

Silverash Clan Warrior:
Halt, who are you people?!

Silverash Clan Warrior:
Stop them right now–– Guh...

Yucatan:
–––?!

Yucatan:
(There's a commotion coming from the entrance... What happened?)

Sciurus:
Yucatan, are you alright?!

Yucatan:
Rus?! What are you doing here?

Sciurus:
Huh? Are you dumb? I'm here for you, obviously!

Sciurus:
Everyone else is so worthless, I had to rescue you myself!

Yucatan:
But, it's too dangerous!

Yucatan:
Rus, how many did you bring with you? Y-You didn't have to come yourself, you know. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you!

Sciurus:
......

Sciurus:
Yucatan.

Sciurus:
Say one more word and I'm going to beat the crap out of you.

Yucatan:
Umm...

Sciurus:
Shut up! Think about what you'd do for me. I'll do just the same for you!

Sciurus:
And you'd better not forget it!

Sciurus:
Also, you're not allowed to abandon me ever again.

Yucatan:
Rus...

Yucatan:
You know I'd never do that.

Sciurus:
Hmph! Of course I know!

Sciurus:
Alright, the fact that you're okay is a huge load off my shoulders... Now, I have something else to take care of. I promised Ratatos I'd finish another job after I save you.

Yucatan:
A job?

Browntail Clan Warrior:
Madame Sciurus, Weiss of the Silverash clan is moving to intercept us!

Sciurus:
Right on schedule. I'll tell you the details later, but our job is to cause some trouble for those Silverash bastards.

Sciurus:
And... there's someone else I want to talk to. But that comes later!

Sciurus:
Things aren't looking too good, and Weiss won't go down easy... But we're in this together. Right, Yucatan?

Yucatan:
......

Yucatan:
Of course. I'll be there for you as long as you need me.

Matterhorn:
Close in on them!

Matterhorn:
Don't let Arctosz up the mountain path!

Paleroche Clan Warrior:
Sir, we're about to be completely encircled!

Arctosz:
Hmph... I suppose this is as far as we could get just charging through.

Matterhorn:
Please lay down your arms, Arctosz.

Arctosz:
Child of Yek, I don't know what Enciodes offered you to make you so infatuated with him.

Arctosz:
The Yek family is prominent in Paleroche lands.

Arctosz:
Yet you still chose to help Enciodes usurp Kjerag!

Matterhorn:
......

Arctosz:
Lay down my arms?

Arctosz:
Never.

Matterhorn:
Arrest Arctosz... But try to take him alive.

Tschäggättä:
......

Arctosz:
Come at me, Silverash scum! Who's brave enough to face me?!

Tschäggättä:
......?!

Matterhorn:
...Aurora?!

Matterhorn:
Does that mean––

Matterhorn:
Doctor––?!

Matterhorn:
Don't tell me, Degenbrecher...

Arctosz:
Ah, Doctor, it's about damned time!

Arctosz:
Haha, Kjerag's snow is a challenge for outsiders like you.

Arctosz:
No worries. All that matters is that you're here!

Arctosz:
Heh, now that reinforcements are here, nothing can stop us!

Enciodes:
Isn't it too early to celebrate, Arctosz?

Arctosz:
Enciodes!

Enciodes:
Long time no see, Doctor.

Enciodes:
Though there's a lot I want to talk to you about, now is not the time, unfortunately.

Arctosz:
Just you wait, Enciodes. I'll break through your encirclement, rescue the Saintess, and prove to all of Kjerag that you're the real traitor!

Enciodes:
I’m looking forward to it.

Arctosz:
Warriors, what has been the house of Paleroche's duty since the beginning of time?

'Defend Kjerag from foreign enemies, and protect the peace of the land!'

Arctosz:
Now, Enciodes seeks to work against the Saintess and use her as his tool.

Arctosz:
Can we, the hosue of Paleroche, accept that?

'No! No! Absolutely not!!!'

Arctosz:
Reinforcements have arrived. Follow me up Mount Karlan, topple Enciodes, and rescue the Saintess!

'Topple Enciodes, rescue the Saintess!'

'Topple Enciodes, rescue the Saintess!!'

'Topple Enciodes, rescue the Saintess!!!'

Tschäggättä:
......

Silverash Clan Warrior:
Saintess, what are you doing?!

Enya:
I'm heading down the mountain.

Silverash Clan Warrior:
Sir Enciodes said––

Enya:
Since when do I need Enciodes's consent to do things?

'Ding ding', 'ding ding', 'ding ding––'

An otherworldly bell sounds throughout the court.

The next moment, everyone present except Ensia falls to the ground.

Ensia:
Wow... incredible...

Enya:
Kjarr, Kjarr.

Kjarr:
Saintess, how did you know I was here?

Enya:
I can guess where a clever girl hides.

Enya:
I need to make a trip down the mountain, so please look after things here.

Kjarr:
Oh, are you leaving the hard work to me?

Enya:
There are even more troublesome things waiting for me.

Kjarr:
If that's the case, I suppose I can't object.

Kjarr:
......

Kjarr:
In fact, during each Saintess selection, I'd dress up as a maid and secretly observe the girls being tested.

Kjarr:
You were the sixth one that year.

Kjarr:
I didn't have very high expectations for you, at first, since the Saintesses have been more and more boring as of late.

Kjarr:
They may have been strong of body, but none of them were sufficiently strong of will and all ended up puppets of the Elders.

Kjarr:
I sometimes wonder if this is because Kjerag is too closed-off. They, and the people of this country too, stagnated.

Kjarr:
But you're different.

Kjarr:
You're very interesting, Enya.

Kjarr:
You didn't come here because you wanted to be the Saintess, but because of your anger and disappointment.

Kjarr:
You faced the unforgiving elements on the trail up the mountain, you refused to give up even when your body had reached its limits, the thing on your mind...

Kjarr:
Was not becoming a Saintess, or becoming an envoy of Kjeragandr. Rather, you were thinking about how best to serve the Kjerag people.

Kjarr:
You thought about how disappointed you were in your brother, how disgusted you were with the other two clans, and the rage you felt at becoming the Saintess.

Kjarr:
But the real surprise was your attitude towards Kjerag.

Kjarr:
Or more accurately, the surprise that your family brought me.

Kjarr:
Your brother gave me his answer sheet very early on.

Kjarr:
And you have been searching for your own answers this entire time.

Kjarr:
Over the years, you've endured the indifference with which the Saintess is treated in the Vine-Bear Court, while actively searching for a way to help the people. These things have become your nourishment.

Kjarr:
And now, all that nourishment has transformed into your strength. You have not lost yourself amidst the turmoil, and you have made your choice.

Kjarr:
Congratulations, my child, my envoy, my friend, my sister.

Kjarr:
Forgive me for not being able to guide you. I rashly branded this land with my mark, and still regret it to this day.

Kjarr:
But at least, allow me to add some color to your journey.

Above the silent passageway, Kjarr smiles and gently pats her hands together.

'Clap, clap.'

After which, everything changes.

Gulo:
Just a scratch!

Valais:
Ugh...

Gulo:
Valais, I'm not sure if Master Arctosz wronged you in some way––

Gulo:
But Enciodes isn't exactly a saint himself!

Valais:
I already told you.

Valais:
Kjerag needs change.

Valais:
This is also so that excellent warriors like yourself will no longer make sacrifices in vain!

Gulo:
Don't force my hand, Valais.

Valais:
That's my line, Gulo.

The two of them take a step back and assume a solid stance.

They know that today, one of them must fall.

Gulo:
What's that?

Valais:
The dark cloud... cleared?

Yucatan:
......

Weiss:
Gah... What a stubborn one. I underestimated you.

Weiss:
But, even if you manage to defeat us here, it won't make any difference.

Weiss:
You cannot stop the Master.

Yucatan:
Like I care.

Yucatan:
The Matriarch... Ratatos always had her own ideas about Kjerag.

Yucatan:
She also wants people to move forward and hopes that everyone can have a better future.

Yucatan:
Except, she doesn't have the power.

Yucatan:
And so, she became Ratatos the schemer, as you people call her.

Yucatan:
Maybe to you, my sister is just a bump in the road.

Yucatan:
But to me, she'll always be my beloved sister!

Sciurus:
Yucatan...

Weiss:
......

Weiss:
We don't hold any personal grudges against you. As long as you're willing to lay down your arms, we guarantee your safety.

Yucatan:
I'm not going to let Rus and I become bargaining chips for Enciodes to use against the Matriarch.

Yucatan:
Weiss of the Silverash clan, step aside, or I will kill you.

Weiss:
The same goes for you, Yucatan of the Browntail clan.

Weiss:
You must remain here.

Sciurus:
You can do it, Yucatan!

Sciurus:
Huh...?

Sciurus:
Look, Mount Karlan! Are those dark clouds clearing up?!

Sharp turns and watches Degenbrecher slowly return her swordbreakers to her waist.

Around them, trees lie snapped in twain and rocks shattered as if a Catastrophe swept through the land.

He doesn't notice his knife slipping, because he has already lost feeling in his right hand.

He has lost.

Degenbrecher:
Best not overuse your right hand for the next three months.

Sharp:
Thanks for the tip. Looks like it's time to take a brief medical leave.

Degenbrecher:
You don't seem very upset about it.

Sharp:
The outcome of our fight here doesn't change anything.

Sharp:
I kept you occupied here until now, so I've done my job. The others will handle the rest.

Sharp:
Now that my job's done, it's time to clock out.

Degenbrecher:
Is your job that important to you?

Sharp:
Maintaining professionalism is very important to me.

Sharp:
Finding a good employer isn't easy, so I do happen to care about this job.

Sharp:
What about you? You knew from the beginning that I was here to waste your time. You don't look that upset about it.

Degenbrecher:
......

Degenbrecher:
Call it a bit of curiosity. Even if you managed to delay me here, what exactly can you accomplish?

Sharp:
Looks like, Enciodes's bodyguards are good for doing more than just his dirty work.

Sharp:
People only know that Enciodes bought The Black Knight. They don't know the Black Knight also approves of Enciodes.

Sharp:
You and Enciodes are both prideful.

Degenbrecher:
...I'll remember your name, Sharp.

Sharp:
You don't have to remember my name, but you would do well to remember the Doctor's.

Degenbrecher:
Hm?

Sharp:
What's going on at Mount Karlan?

Arctosz:
......

Enciodes:
......

Arctosz:
Soldiers, in formation.

Paleroche Clan Warriors:
Yessir!

Enciodes:
All forces––

Tschäggättä:
—!

Silverash Clan Warriors:
......!

Enciodes:
–––?!

Arctosz:
What happened?

Time seems to stand still in this moment.

Only the Saintess's footsteps reverberate through the mountains.

The wind and snow already gave way, at some unknown time.

The dark clouds overhead seem to part before her path, slowly spreading to both sides.

The light filtering through the clouds shines upon the Saintess, and for a second, the people see her descending from the sky itself.

But this is no illusion.

A miracle...

It's a miracle.

It's a miracle!!!

In this moment, only one thought remains in the hearts of the warriors.

And that is –– to offer their staunchest devotion to the Saintess.

Servant:
Kjarr.

Kjarr:
Go. I will attend to the Great Elder.

Servant:
Of course.

Great Elder:
......

Kjarr:
Come to think of it, even though the great hall has been repaired several times, it may not be much younger than Her.

Kjarr:
The same goes for the title of Great Elder.

Great Elder:
......

Kjarr:
No one would deny that the existence of the Vine-Bear Court has allowed Kjerag to remain united all these years.

Kjarr:
But what was correct in the past may no longer be correct.

Kjarr:
If you cannot adapt to the changing times, then no matter how strong you are, you are fated to be cast aside.

Kjarr:
Kjerag should not suffer that fate. At least, that is what some people hope.

Kjarr:
Sweet dreams, Great Elder.

Kjarr:
You've done well. You've all done well.

Valais:
...How?

Gulo:
...What is THAT?

Gulo:
Is that... a miracle...?

Weiss:
What's going on at Mount Karlan?

Weiss:
All forces, pull back.

Sciurus:
What... just happened?

Yucatan:
Can it be... a miracle from Kjeragandr?

Ratatos:
......

Ratatos:
What will happen to Kjerag now...?

Degenbrecher:
Hurts my eyes.

Degenbrecher:
You've got me wondering now. Is this also a part of your Doctor's plans?

Sharp:
I don't know myself.

Sharp:
To be honest, if this was a part of the Doctor's plans, or even an anticipated possibility...

Sharp:
Even if some operators act like the Doctor is omnipotent, I think this would be a bridge too far.

Degenbrecher:
......

Ensia:
Enya, I'm scared...

Enya:
Don't be, Ensia.

Enya:
I will protect you.

Enya:
I... will protect Kjerag.

All the warriors along the mountain trail lay their weapons down.

In the face of a miracle from the Goddess of the Snowy Mountains, the goddess they have worshipped all their lives, their mortal squabbles seem ridiculous.

Arctosz:
......

Arctosz:
I, leader of the Paleroche clan, Arctosz Paleroche, offer my most sincere blessings to Her envoy, the Saintess.

After a short silence, he slowly bows to the Saintess and kneels before her.

All the Paleroche warriors follow his lead, repeating his actions.

Gnosis:
...Having second thoughts now, Enciodes?

Enciodes:
What do you mean?

Gnosis:
You ignored my advice and brought that Doctor to Kjerag.

Enciodes:
Do you think we lost?

Gnosis:
Does this not seem like a loss to you?

Enciodes:
It might have, in the past.

Enciodes:
But today... maybe not.

Enciodes steps forward.

He strides out from the crowd and also approaches the Saintess, taking a knee and offering his blessings.

All the warriors of the Silverash clan follow suit.

And thus, the Snowcap Incident comes to an unexpected conclusion.
