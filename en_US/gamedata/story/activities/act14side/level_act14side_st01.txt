Enciodes:
Now that this is settled, the three clans must start liaising frequently with one another.

Enciodes:
We must further discuss the specific of the transfer of powers to the Saintess and what powers each family is allowed to keep.

Enciodes:
However, aside from this, the preparations the three of us must make for the ritual are equally important.

Enciodes:
Therefore, with the upcoming ceremony, I propose we seize the occasion and transfer our powers to the Saintess at the same time.

Enciodes:
The ceremony and the transfer of powers are managed by different individuals. As such, both can be conducted at the same time. What's more, the ceremony also calls for the participation of the clan leaders. What do you think of the idea, if I may so ask?

Arctosz:
The decision has been made. It will happen in due course.

Ratatos:
*Sigh*...

Ratatos:
This year's ceremony will also be a ceremony for the transfer of powers to the Saintess, huh? Guess we have something to look forward to.

Great Elder:
In that case, I will have my men draft the relevant documents and distribute them across Kjerag.

Great Elder:
I am sure the masses will be rejoiced to learn of this.

Arctosz:
Wait.

Enciodes:
Is something the matter?

Arctosz:
You can't hoodwink your way out of this, Enciodes. Who will manage the valleys and the mines the next few days? Gnosis was in charge, but you had him fired. Who will take care of all that?

Enciodes:
You needn't worry, Arctosz.

Enciodes:
I hired an expert from outside Kjerag.

Enciodes:
This expert will conduct a field investigation on the valley and the mine from a disease prevention perspective and construct a medical facility within Silverash territory.

Enciodes:
I will put this person in complete control of the two areas.

Enciodes:
Look at the time. The train should be arriving in Karlan right about now. If you two would like to meet the expert, you need only wait a short moment longer.

Arctosz:
Enough of this nonsense! I have no idea who you hired and what you are planning with this medical charade. However...!

Arctosz:
This so called 'expert' of yours will stay within my sight at all times!

Enciodes:
This is my guest you're talking about, Arctosz.

Arctosz:
That's exactly why, Enciodes.

Arctosz:
You said the overmining was Gnosis's doing, and I couldn't care less whether that's the case or not.

Arctosz:
The way I see it, anyone you hire might as well be another Gnosis. We may be rid of one, but there will always be more.

Arctosz:
You want to leave your men in charge of the place? Fine, but you will have to show me what this expert is capable of.

Arctosz:
If your expert does well, then not only will they be your guest, Enciodes, I vow to welcome them with my warmest hospitality as my own guest.

Enciodes:
......

Arctosz:
What's the matter? You were talking so big. Do you really need so much time to think?

Arctosz:
If everything is as you said, what is there to hesitate about? Or do you mean to tell us this person you hired is indeed another Gnosis, here to do your dirty work again?

Enciodes:
The Paleroches have always been in charge of the Vine-Bear Court's security. Now that I've agreed to turn these lands over to the Court, I cannot be more reassured with the Paleroches looking after them.

Enciodes:
That said...

Enciodes:
A word of advice, Arctosz. You'd best be careful. Entertaining this guest of ours will be no walk in the park.

Arctosz:
Hah, not a problem. There are no guests we Paleroches cannot 'entertain.'

Arctosz:
—Let's find out whether this guest is as stiff-necked as you.

Ratatos:
Sciurus, I need you to look into this guest.

Sciurus:
Having me run your errands again?

Ratatos:
I'm not in the mood for your sharp tongue.

Sciurus:
Grr.

Sciurus:
Monch, Monch!

Monch:
Monch here.

Sciurus:
Get me a car!

Monch:
Of course.

Sciurus:
Yucatan, go!

Yucatan:
Please watch your step, Madame.

Arctosz:
Valais... What's your view on all this?

Valais:
I'm afraid I'm not capable enough to see Enciodes's intent.

Arctosz:
I don't blame you, but I certainly didn't expect that crafty woman Ratatos to agree to it. I don't get it.

Valais:
It's Matriarch Ratatos. I'm sure she has her ideas.

Arctosz:
Hmph, all I know is that Silverash brat has to be planning something.

Arctosz:
And he may sound like he has a point, but I will never believe anything he says so easily!

Arctosz:
Tell Gulo to 'invite' Enciodes's guest over. We'll figure out what to do later.

Valais:
Yessir.

Ensia:
Man, I didn't expect it to start snowing the moment we got off the train.

Ensia:
Doctor, let's wait till it stops before we head up the mountain.

Ensia:
This actually isn't so bad. We get snowstorms like this in Kjerag all the time.

Ensia:
Hm?

Ensia:
Actually, that sounds like fun...

Ensia:
But we still have a long way to go. We should save our strength.

Ensia:
Eh... It's kind of a pain to get to Karlan right now.

Ensia:
I hope the train will take us all the way to the foot of the mountain one day.

Ensia:
We may call this the Karlan Railway, but there's actually a stretch of distance from the station to the foot of the mountain where we aren't allowed to build anything.

Ensia:
There is a lot of resistance to the idea... I'm not too sure about this stuff, but I don't think it's going to be easy.

Ensia:
A lot of the people here insist on walking every single step up Mount Karlan, thinking to do otherwise would be unfaithful, but I don't think Kjeragandr would mind.

Ensia:
We Kjerag folk always keep faith in our hearts. How would taking a train straight to the mountain change any of that?

Weiss:
......

Weiss:
Sir Enciodes has always wanted to have the railway go straight to Karlan.

Weiss:
Alas, the lands up ahead belong to the Paleroches.

Weiss:
Sir Arctosz would never let him build any tracks there.

Weiss:
Half a year ago, there was even a bit of a tussle between General Gulo of the Paleroches and Gnosis.

Ensia:
With Gnosis?

Ensia:
Oh, right, I haven't heard anything about him for a while. Is he doing okay?

Weiss:
He... He was fired because of that scuffle.

Weiss:
One of the reasons Sir Enciodes invited the Doctor here is because he wanted the Doctor to fill his role.

Ensia:
Huh? How come no one told me that?

Ensia:
Doctor, did anyone...

Ensia:
......

Ensia:
What's the matter...? Who are you people?!

Weiss:
Lady Ensia...! Get behind me!

Gulo:
On Sir Arctosz's orders, I'm here to extend the Silverashes' guest, {@nickname}, an invitation to the Arctosz estate.

Ensia:
You're bringing all these soldiers along to invite OUR guest to your place? What kind of sick joke is this?!

Ensia:
This place belongs to my family, the Silverashes! General Gulo, you may work for the Paleroches, but I suggest you don't do anything out of line.

Gulo:
I see you're here as well, Lady Ensia. You'll have to pardon me for my intrusion.

Ensia:
I'll cut to the chase. Dr. {@nickname} is the Silverashes' guest, and you aren't bringing anyone along on your way home. Not on my watch.

Weiss:
......

Gulo:
Relax, Lady Ensia. Sir Arctosz only wanted to invite the esteemed guest to pay our humble abode a visit.

Ensia:
As if my brother would agree to something that unreasonable!

Gulo:
Not to worry, Lady Ensia. Your brother... Sir Enciodes has already given us his approval.

Ensia:
No way!

Gulo:
It's true.

Gulo:
Also, Lady Ensia, mentioned the ownership of the land here...

Gulo:
—This isn't Silverash territory anymore.

Gulo:
From now on, the land belongs to the Vine-Bear Court.

Ensia:
Come again?!

Ensia:
Weiss, what's the meaning of this? First, it's the reason the Doctor was invited here. Then, it's the ownership of the lands. What else are you keeping from me?!

Weiss:
Sorry, Lady Ensia...

Ensia:
Weiss, come on... what's happening?

Gulo:
Which one of you is {@nickname}?

Gulo:
The one in the hood... Right, it's you.

Sharp:
......

Sharp:
It's me.

Gulo:
Hm? I'm pretty sure I'm looking for someone in a hood...

Gulo:
No way, it's gotta be you!

Gulo:
If it's not you, then keep your mouth shut!

Gulo:
Wait, hold on! With that hood... It's gotta be you!

Sharp:
...(Breathes a long sigh)

Sharp:
If you say so...

Kjerag Warrior A:
Don't move! Hands off your weapons!

Kjerag Warrior B:
Last warning. No funny moves...

Gulo:
You don't seem very happy about our arrangement?

Gulo:
Know your place, outsider. Sir Arctosz gave you an 'invitation.' Most people are never so lucky.

???:
You dare act so impudent, knowing that's an esteemed guest who stands before you?

Gulo:
–––?!

You hear footsteps accompanied by dull, metallic clanking sounds. An impressively tall woman walks toward you.

Immediately, everything falls silent. The Kjerag soldiers surrounding you put away their weapons and step aside with timid looks on their faces.

She takes a quick glance at all of you, briefly pausing as her gaze lands on the elite operator standing next to you.

Sharp:
......

The moment their eyes meet, they put their hands on their weapons by pure instinct.

Degenbrecher:
I assume you will do whatever it takes to get this 'Doctor' to pay your visit today?

Gulo:
We have our orders, and Sir Enciodes gave us his approval... You shouldn't have a problem with that?

Degenbrecher:
Relax. I'm not here for you.

Gulo:
......

Degenbrecher:
Lady Ensia, Enciodes asked me to escort you home.

Ensia:
Degenbrecher, did my brother really...?

Degenbrecher:
Correct.

Degenbrecher:
I'm here to receive our guest for Enciodes, and I've done that now.

Degenbrecher:
That's right.

Sharp:
......

Degenbrecher:
......

Degenbrecher:
Please, go on.

Sharp:
Looks like Sir Enciodes is so busy that he doesn't have the time to come fetch the Doctor himself?

Degenbrecher:
Correct.

Degenbrecher:
Put your weapon down. I would rather not offend our guest's bodyguard in any way.

Sharp:
It's part of my job to carry a weapon at all times, and you're not my boss.

Sharp:
I'm the Doctor's bodyguard. Wherever the Doctor goes, I go.

Gulo:
My instructions are to invite the Doctor, and the Doctor alone.

Sharp:
If you say so...

Ensia:
Doctor, are you seriously going?

Ensia:
Don't worry? How am I supposed to not worry? And why are you even going along with what they're saying, Doctor?

Ensia:
But if it wasn't for us inviting you in the first place, this wouldn't have happened... Why are you going along with this so easily? I still haven't been told a thing...

Ensia:
Doctor, stop grinning. You're reminding me of my brother... And why are you going along with this? I don't get it...

Degenbrecher:
Gulo.

Gulo:
......

Degenbrecher:
You'd do well to treat our guest better than that.

Degenbrecher:
Say 'please.'

Gulo:
......

Gulo:
Doctor of Rhodes Island... 'Please' follow us to the Paleroche estate.

Degenbrecher:
Oh...?

Degenbrecher:
Hmph.

Degenbrecher:
I'm just Enciodes's bodyguard.

Degenbrecher:
I will.

Sharp:
......

Sharp:
Looks like I'm working overtime again.

Ensia:
Enciodes!

Enciodes:
You're home, Ensia.

Enciodes:
You've traveled far, my dear sister.

Ensia:
Enciodes, why?

Enciodes:
Slow down.

Ensia:
Why did you hand the Doctor over to the Paleroches?!

Enciodes:
I need the Doctor to carry some of Gnosis's responsibilities for me, and as you know, the relationship between Karlan Trade and the Paleroches has been tense.

Enciodes:
Arctosz demanded that the Doctor operate under his supervision, and it's a reasonable ask.

Ensia:
Then why didn't you tell the Doctor?! Not even I knew about this arrangement!

Enciodes:
It happened after I had the invitation sent out.

Ensia:
But still...!

Enciodes:
I know Rhodes Island saved you, and I know you think very highly of the Doctor.

Enciodes:
Trust me, Ensia, I think of the Doctor no less highly than you do.

Enciodes:
If the Doctor comes to harm there, the Paleroches will pay the price.

Ensia:
No, Enciodes... I'm not just a Silverash. I'm an employee of Rhodes Island. I have a responsibility to ensure the Doctor's safety.

Ensia:
Leave that to me.

Enciodes:
You've grown up, Ensia.

Enciodes:
Let's do this, then. Matterhorn.

Matterhorn:
Sir.

Enciodes:
Have someone keep an eye on what's going happening over there.

Enciodes:
As soon as the Doctor begins work in the valleys and mines, you may take Ensia to see the Doctor.

Matterhorn:
Very good, Sir.

Ensia:
Enciodes!

Enciodes:
Go, Ensia. Rest well.

Ensia:
Alright!

Matterhorn:
Master, about the Doctor...

Enciodes:
Matterhorn, make sure Ensia is safe.

Matterhorn:
I... I will.

Degenbrecher:
It's useless, you know.

Enciodes:
She isn't the kind of girl we can keep inside the house.

Degenbrecher:
I'll keep an eye on her.

Enciodes:
I need you on standby.

Degenbrecher:
So be it, then.

Degenbrecher:
Speaking of which, how much do you know about this Doctor of Rhodes Island?

Enciodes:
An excellent scholar of outstanding professionalism who understands the profits that Rhodes Island will see from working with me.

Enciodes:
That the Doctor so quickly got the grasp of the situation and accepted the arrangement shows that I was correct in my assessment. Why do you ask?

Degenbrecher:
I don't think this Doctor is merely a 'scholar.' Great at sniffing things out, no doubt, and much more so than you expected, too.

Degenbrecher:
And besides, this Doctor sends you regards.

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
You think the Doctor foresaw all this?

Degenbrecher:
I sensed not a bit of surprise under that hood. Not only did this scholar of yours understand the situation completely, there was never even a hint of astonishment, and I must emphasize that.

Degenbrecher:
What's more, apparently my reputation precedes me.

Enciodes:
Looks like our friend came prepared.

Degenbrecher:
Trust my intuition, Enciodes. I have an eye for people.

Degenbrecher:
You might've made yourself an enemy with this move of yours.

Enciodes:
An enemy?

Enciodes:
No, if the intel I gathered and your description are correct, then the Doctor will become my dearest friend... or should I say, I will become the Doctor's dearest friend?

Chester:
Sir Enciodes, it's time for your meeting.

Enciodes:
Let's go.

Gnosis sits quietly in the conference room.

Everyone sits far away from him, but their gossip echoes through the room, clear as day.

Enciodes:
Gnosis, it's been a while. You've lost weight.

Gnosis:
Thanks to you, Mr. President.

Enciodes:
We spent four years in Victoria together. It pains me to see things turn out this way.

Gnosis:
Enciodes, you've thrown me under the bus already. Let's skip the pleasantries.

Mid-level Manager:
Gnosis, you prick, don't you know who you're talking to?!

Mid-level Manager:
If it wasn't for your friendship with the president, you wouldn't even be allowed to stand here now that you're sacked!

Gnosis:
I don't remember needing anyone's permission to stand here.

Mid-level Manager:
How dare you!

Enciodes:
Gnosis, there is no doubt that Karlan Trade owes much to you for its establishment and growth.

Enciodes:
However, whether you have a right to be here or not... that is not for you to say.

Enciodes:
Uncle Chester, please.

Chester:
Very well.

Chester:
First, regarding the sentencing of Karlan Trade's former chief technical officer Gnosis Edelweiss.

Chester:
There is no doubt that the expansion of the valleys and mines under Gnosis Edelweiss's management has brought the company tremendous profit.

Chester:
But, on the other hand, the rapid expansion strategy and the secret mining of Karlan has brought the company under the repeated scrutiny of the Tri-Clan Council.

Chester:
In particular, when the other clans asked to participate in the valley's investigation, Gnosis planned to ambush the two clans' inspection team.

Chester:
This has severely damaged Karlan Trade's image and the Silverashes' standing in the Tri-Clan Council.

Chester:
Therefore, President Enciodes has decided that, effective today, Gnosis Edelweiss will be formally terminated as a Karlan Trade employee.

Gnosis:
So that's why you had me come. You wanted to read all these criticisms you have for me out loud in front of everyone.

Enciodes:
Your actions have brought harm to Karlan Trade's profits. This is how I answer our stakeholders. I hope you can understand.

Gnosis:
Very well... Enciodes.

Gnosis:
I would never have imagined all those years ago when I came to Kjerag to build this place up with you that this is how it would all end.

Enciodes:
I am sure both you and I agree that it's far more important to do what's reasonable and beneficial than look back on old times.

Enciodes:
That said, I will leave you your lab. You are free to keep using it as soon as any sensitive Karlan Trade data has been removed.

Enciodes:
I could also arrange for you to join a caravan heading for Victoria, if that's what you prefer.

Enciodes:
I have to answer to all the stakeholders here. Likewise, I have to give you an answer.

Gnosis:
If you think what you are doing is reasonable, then I feel nothing but disappointment in you.

Gnosis:
Karlan Trade yet needs my technology, and Kjerag's industrial sector has not come so far that it can progress without importing core technologies from the outside world.

Gnosis:
You promised me a suitably large stage and backed my research, so that we can break new ground in these promising snowlands for the welfare of the people of Kjerag.

Gnosis:
In the end, this is where my stage is, and I am being thrown under the bus for this company.

Enciodes:
I still approve of your achievements in academic research, Gnosis.

Enciodes:
That is why, more so than anyone, I'm hoping that you could reflect on what you have done.

Enciodes:
You should never have let things out of my control.

Gnosis:
Hmph, are you so weak now that you're scared of letting anything out of your iron grip?

Gnosis:
If that doesn't open my eyes!

A loud bang reverberates throughout the room. Gnosis slams the conference room's door shut with enough force that the gust of wind sends paper flying through the air.

Shocked by the sudden thunderclap, the spectators all instinctively look toward the source of the sound before casting their heads down under the invisible pressure.

No one knows just what expression Enciodes holds at this moment.

Enciodes:
Let's continue, Chester.

Chester:
As requested by Sir Arctosz, the leader of Rhodes Island, Dr. {@nickname}, will be in charge of the transfer of the valleys and mines under the protection of the Paleroches.

Chester:
We will formally introduce the Doctor to everyone at the company once all the tasks at hand are complete.

Chester:
Onto our next topic, the meat of our meeting today.

Chester:
The preliminary discussions on how to partition the company's power and hand it over to the Saintess.

Chester:
First off, on the matter of tariffs...

Arctosz:
What do I call you, outsider?

Arctosz:
Funny name.

Arctosz:
Valais told me Enciodes's people call you the Doctor. That's what I'll call you.

Arctosz:
Doctor? Sounds just like the scholars over at the academy.

Arctosz:
Doctor, do you know why you're here?

Arctosz:
Hmph, Enciodes wants you to take Gnosis's place, but I don't trust his people. That's why I'm keeping my eye on you.

Gulo:
Sir, I'm pretty sure we got a smartass playing dumb here.

Arctosz:
Hmph, you're Enciodes's 'guest.' Even if you really don't know a thing, you're still Enciodes's people.

Arctosz:
Hmph, I invited you here because I didn't want him to fill you in on anything.

Valais:
Please stop playing dumb.

Valais:
Considering Sir Enciodes invited you now, of all times, no one will believe that you came to Kjerag for mere sightseeing.

Arctosz:
Valais, tell our guest the deal.

Valais:
Sir Enciodes has decided to transfer the valley and the mines to the Vine-Bear Court. The man who was in charge of the mines and the factory was his subordinate, Gnosis.

Valais:
And ever since Gnosis was dismissed, the coordinator position has been left vacant.

Valais:
According to Sir Enciodes, you are his replacement.

Arctosz:
Looks like you have a clear understanding of the situation now.

Arctosz:
Until I am sure that Enciodes isn't making any funny moves in the mines and the valleys, you aren't leaving this place.

Arctosz:
Don't you even think about pulling any tricks yourself. My men don't care about etiquette nearly as much as Enciodes's people.

Arctosz:
If they want your head, there's nothing I can do to stop them.

Gulo:
Hah, boss, look at this squirt. I wouldn't know where to chop if I were to try my blade on this midget.

Kjerag Warriors:
Hahahahaha!

Arctosz:
Hmph, shut up, all of you. I'm not going to make things too hard for you, outsider.

Arctosz:
In the end, you're Enciodes's guest. As long as you play along, we won't do anything to you.

Arctosz:
Am I making myself clear?

Gulo:
......

Arctosz:
Enough, Valais. Show our guest to the bedroom.

Valais:
Very good, Sir.

Kjarr:
Enya, I'm coming in.

Kjarr:
I knew it... You're still sleeping.

Kjarr:
Enya. Enya, rise and shine.

Sleepyhead Enya:
Uhh.... Huh?

Sleepyhead Enya:
Morn.

After a brief fuss, Enya gets dressed and sits in front of her dressing table. Kjarr naturally stands behind her and combs her hair.

Enya:
*Sigh*...

Kjarr:
What's the matter now?

Enya:
You know.

Kjarr:
Isn't it a good thing to become leader of all three clans?

Kjarr:
You always say that, in the Vine-Bear Court, your role is simply to keep the masses calm, and most of the time, it's actually the Great Elder who calls the shots.

Kjarr:
This is an opportunity.

Enya:
I wouldn't be so worried if it had been Arctosz or even Ratatos who brought up the idea.

Enya:
But it was Enciodes who made that proposal.

Kjarr:
Perhaps the guilt's suddenly gotten to him?

Enya:
I sure hope so.

Kjarr:
But if you're so worried about this, couldn't you have turned it down?

Kjarr:
Didn't you agree to it without thinking twice?

Enya:
That's because there wasn't a point to dragging it out.

Enya:
No one had any grounds to object.

Enya:
It doesn't matter whether he really wants me to be Kjerag's leader. There wasn't anyone who could reject the proposal then and there.

Enya:
And if we had set the issue aside, more people would've found out.

Kjarr:
You told me that the masses have gotten used to peace, just like they've gotten used to the endless snow on the mountains.

Kjarr:
The people of Kjerag wish for peace first and foremost, and they gravitate toward those who can bring them peace.

Enya:
Right, peace. Whether it's the peace that Enciodes brought them or the peace that the Vine-Bear Court brought.

Enya:
That's why, even if I turned down the offer, the people would've asked me to accept.

Enya:
So I might as well take the initiative myself before the Great Elder makes all the arrangements.

Kjarr:
You think Enciodes foresaw that?

Enya:
He made a proposal that no one could refuse. Under normal circumstances, he would've been the last person to suggest this.

Enya:
I am sure both Arctosz and Ratatos thought the same thing.

Enya:
I can see why Arctosz went along with it, but Ratatos... She was never the kind of person to give up easily.

Enya:
What a headache. I really hope Kjeragandr will hear my prayers and teach the Great Elder and the three clan leaders a good lesson.

Kjarr:
Perhaps She has already heard your prayers, and it just isn't time yet.

Kjarr:
Do you want Her to take care of Enciodes too?

Enya:
For him, as cruel as possible.

Kjarr:
Pff.

Kjarr:
Now let's put this necklace on you... and we're done!

Enya:
Mmhmm.

Enya:
Right, would you give this letter and scarf to Ensia? Also...

Kjarr:
Ask her to come pay the mountain a visit, right?

Enya:
You know me well.

Kjarr:
Hehe.

Enya:
Also, send the word out that I'll be analyzing scriptures today, and I don't want to be disturbed.

Enya:
I... I need some time to think.

Kjarr:
Of course.

Enya:
......

After Kjarr leaves the room, Enya opens her drawer to see an exquisitely decorated base, holding an eye-catching, elegant rock.

The Rock:
......

Enya:
O Kjeragandr, please guide me. What should I do?

We no longer live in times where isolation is enough to keep ourselves out of the affairs around us.

In the past hundred years, there have been countless exchanges and conflicts between nations. Columbia rose quickly in a conflict, while Gaul, a powerful country, was also wiped out in a conflict.

All the world's nations are slowly changing in these times separated by Catastrophes. Refusing relations with others is no longer an option.

Kjerag cannot continue to lock itself away on these snowy mounts. Kjeragandr's protection—if Kjeragandr really exists in the first place—can bring the Snow Realm this far.

If we are to go any further, Kjerag must grow stronger than ever before.

The millennium of peace and quiet has reached its end, and we cannot wait for others to open the door for us.

Kjerag needs to make contact with the outside world. We must take that step forward while we still have control. That's the Silverash tradition.

Kjerag must remain Kjerag. We still have a chance, but time grows short for the snowy mountains.

I have seen our world... I have to make a difference. Everything I've witnessed needs to have meaning.

Sciurus:
So you are Gnosis.

Gnosis:
That's right.

Sciurus:
Do you know who I am?

Gnosis:
Sciurus Browntail, sister of the Browntail clan matriarch, Ratatos Browntail.

Sciurus:
You know that, and you have the balls to forgo a salute?

Gnosis:
Why must I salute someone whom I have nothing to do with?

Sciurus:
You! Don't you know your manners?!

Gnosis:
If we must talk manners, you should work on yours first, Sciurus Browntail.

Gnosis:
I heard all your commotion outside the door. What's more, when nobles meet, they must each first curtsey to each other with a Karlan bow.

Gnosis:
If you show up here without affording me any courtesy, why should I show you any?

Sciurus:
J-Just how outdated is your idea of etiquette?!

Gnosis:
Etiquette never dies. It's only slowly forgotten. As a noble, you should feel sorrow in that.

Yucatan:
The Edelweisses have long been in charge of the management of Kjerag's texts and records. I admire your knowledge of Kjerag etiquette, Mr. Gnosis.

Yucatan:
Still though, I'm afraid Madame Sciurus isn't here to discuss Kjerag etiquette. Could we please move on to the main topic?

Gnosis:
Very well. I'm curious. Considering Ratatos refused my capitulation, why is she now reaching out to me?

Sciurus:
Hmph, do you have to ask?! It's because your master proposed handing his powers over to the Saintess at the Tri-Clan Council!

Gnosis:
I see. In that case...

Gnosis:
Go home and tell Ratatos. Now that things have come to this, I am likely not the only one who will cooperate, given the right amount of sincerity.

Valais:
Per Sir Arctosz's orders, please stay here while you are not attending to your duties.

Valais:
If you need to head outside, we will serve as your bodyguards. Kjerag may be a safe place, but we cannot guarantee no one will take the chance to cause trouble.

Valais:
You will be served the finest delicacies that Kjerag has to offer. You may also use anything here as you see fit. All your daily needs will be met during your stay with us.

Valais:
If you require anything, please let the servants know. You may also have them relay anything to me.

Ensia:
Oripathy consultation... and the Grand Ceremony... Are those the only reasons my brother is inviting you to the Snow Realm?

Ensia:
Oh, the Grand Ceremony takes place annually in Kjerag. It's the biggest ecent, and the most important thing to the Kjerag people.

Ensia:
On that day, everyone in Kjerag stops what they're doing and offers Kjeragandr, the goddess of our mountains, our most sincere prayers.

Ensia:
We pray for a happy, peaceful year under our mountain goddess's protection.

Ensia:
As for the Oripathy problem, Kjerag didn't have many Infected in the past, so most of us don't know much about Oripathy. In the Snow Realms, Oripathy is far from the greatest threat we face.

Ensia:
But ever since my brother got the mountains connected by railway, we've been getting more and more visitors, and life has also gotten much better. Thanks to that, everyone's starting to learn more about the Infected and Oripathy.

Ensia:
I guess Oripathy's stepping into the limelight since there are no other pressing issues.

Ensia:
Kjerag still doesn't have any professional means to test for Oripathy, let alone helping the Infected get settled and get treatment.

Ensia:
Given the situation, you might be the best consultant they can get.

Ensia:
Doctor, are you going to accept the invitation?

Ensia:
Right, you have a lot on your plate right now, but still...

Ensia:
I know it's not easy to make a decision when this invitation came out of nowhere, but still...

Ensia:
Huh?

Ensia:
......

Ensia:
Personally, I really want you to go.

Ensia:
My parents died in an accident when I was still a kid...

Ensia:
And after they died, my brother, Enciodes, took over their business to support the family.

Ensia:
He kept us afloat all by himself until I came of age. Then, to ensure our family's future, he left Kjerag to study in Victoria.

Ensia:
Our family was already on pretty shaky ground before he left Kjerag, and that was around when he started getting more and more headstrong...

Ensia:
But at least we all still got along well as siblings.

Ensia:
But things changed ever since he came back and started Karlan Trade.

Ensia:
Both my brother and sister treated me very well, but, for some reason, the two of them started talking less, and their relationship soured.

Ensia:
Five years ago, when the last Saintess passed away, my sister joined the trials and became the new Kjerag Saintess.

Ensia:
She's rarely left Mount Karlan since, and I haven't had a lot of chances to see her. We only write to each other now.

Ensia:
And ever since she became the Saintess, it feels like my brother's often at odds with her...

Ensia:
I may be very good at mountain climbing, but I wouldn't know where to start to mend relationships.

Ensia:
But you're really amazing, Doctor. You get along with everyone, and you've solved a lot of problems for people.

Ensia:
That's why I was thinking that... if we ever had the chance, maybe you could help me come up with ideas...

Ensia:
But...

Ensia:
Doctor, I guess this might seem weird coming from me...

Ensia:
But I know my brother better than anyone else. He's amazing, but he's the kind of person who doesn't mind doing whatever it takes to achieve his goals.

Ensia:
I'm actually a little worried that you'll end up becoming a pawn in his game, if you go.

Ensia:
So that's why it's okay if you don't want to!

???:
That's why I told you you should've gotten out while you still could.

???:
Look at you now. You're caught.

???:
Exactly.

???:
Huh? You can hear me, right?

???:
Hey, listen!

???:
I could ask you the same, calm outsider.

???:
The entire time you've been here, you haven't even showed the tiniest bit of worry. Did you know this was going to happen?

Kjera:
Call me Kjera.

Kjera:
I changed my mind. I want to be friends with you.

Kjera:
Would you like to be friends with me?

Kjera:
Don't you think it's better for me to maintain a mysterious aura?

Kjera:
Sorry, I'm writing a letter to somebody else right now, so I can't go anywhere. Perhaps another time.

Kjera:
Hmm... That's classified information!

Kjera:
Well, I don't really have so much time to keep bothering you, if you really don't want to talk.

Kjera:
But it's not so bad to have somebody to talk to, don't you think?
