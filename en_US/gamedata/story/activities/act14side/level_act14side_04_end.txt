Enciodes:
......

Matterhorn:
Sir, have some water.

Matterhorn:
You haven't had so much as a sip since yesterday. You still have a hunt later. This is too...

Enciodes:
No need.

Matterhorn:
But––

Enciodes:
This is my decision.

Enciodes:
Don't make me say this twice, Matterhorn.

Matterhorn:
......

Weiss:
Give it up, Matterhorn.

Weiss:
You know better than anyone how stubborn Sir Enciodes is. You knew he wouldn't accept, so why ask?

Matterhorn:
I must at least try.

Matterhorn:
This is too... risky.

Weiss:
Risk and opportunity are two sides of the same coin. It's always been this way for us.

Weiss:
All we have to do is listen to him.

Matterhorn:
......

Weiss:
Phew...

Weiss:
It's cold. The snowstorm is getting stronger, isn't it?

Ratatos:
He's taking too long.

Ratatos:
What a showy guy he must be to have the two other clans wait for him?

Arctosz:
He's walking all the way here. That's not so bad, if you ask me.

Ratatos:
What a surprise. You are commending him? From what I heard, Enciodes is enjoying quite the celebrity status on his way here.

Ratatos:
Arctosz, you'd best be careful. Give it a few more days and Kjeragandr's most devout follower will be Enciodes instead of you.

Arctosz:
Enough of your jabs, Ratatos.

Arctosz:
I don't trust Enciodes, but if he does right thing, who am I to argue?

Arctosz:
Now if you brought me here just to say this, you'll have to excuse me.

Ratatos:
I don't have so much free time on my hands, Arctosz.

Ratatos:
I just wanted to remind you.

Arctosz:
Remind me? There's nothing I need you, of all people, to remind me of.

Ratatos:
Are you sure about that?

Ratatos:
Arctosz, bickering at each other isn't going to help either of us. Given the circumstances, our families have the strongest ties.

Arctosz:
......

Arctosz:
I'm not the one who's bickering, Ratatos.

Arctosz:
I don't like how you and Enciodes are always beating around the bush. I care about actions and nothing else.

Ratatos:
You care about actions. Perfect, then.

Ratatos:
Let's talk about the explosion two days ago.

Arctosz:
What? Are you going to tell me that was the Browntails' doing? Hmph, I'm not falling for that. That's not your style.

Arctosz:
Or are you trying to say you know who's behind it?

Ratatos:
What if I tell you I really do...?

Arctosz:
—You're not kidding?

Ratatos:
Definitely not.

Ratatos:
Why don't you take a guess who gave us a helping hand?

Sciurus:
Monch, Monch!

Sciurus:
Just where did she go...?!

Monch:
Are you looking for me, Madame?

Sciurus:
Do you really need to ask?!

Sciurus:
You're usually pretty quick on your feet. Why're you wandering about like you're going to the park, now of all times?! I told you we must be ready for this hunt... Whatever, how are preparations going?

Sciurus:
To tell you the truth, Monch, you're the most dependable warrior I have.

Sciurus:
It's all down to you whether I can bring honor to the Browntail clan and get back at that bitch Ratatos!

Monch:
......

Monch:
Madame, if I may speak my mind...

Sciurus:
If you have something to say, say it!

Monch:
Right.

Monch:
As I see it, if you truly wish to impress Matriarch Ratatos with such a fine performance that she sees you in a new light, I'm afraid you should set your eyes on more than just the hunt.

Sciurus:
I'm aware of that... but what else could I do?

Sciurus:
Ratatos always has everything thought out well in advance. It's like she's not giving me any chances. Hmph, I'll admit she's a little smarter than me.

Sciurus:
But I... I'm not useless either!

Sciurus:
That's why you have to make sure you do your job well, no matter what it takes, Monch!

Sciurus:
You and I will sap some of that stinking bitch's arrogance together! I will show her how amazing I can be!

Monch:
......

Monch:
I understand how you feel about the Browntails, Madame.

Monch:
But in that case, you should really set your eyes on more than just the hunt.

Sciurus:
Tell me, then. What else could we do?

Monch:
If you trust my judgment—

Sciurus:
What're you talking about? If I don't trust you, who else could I trust?

Monch:
......

Monch:
I appreciate your trust, Madame. So please leave this matter to me. I have a few ideas... but we need to be careful. It's not the right time to jump to conclusions.

Monch:
As for you, Madame, to make sure everything goes well, please do not tell Sir Yucatan about this affair.

Sciurus:
Not even Yucatan?

Sciurus:
Right. He's always in the way, treating me like a little girl. He even tells on me to Ratatos. As if I don't know...

Sciurus:
I'll leave everything to you, Monch! Don't disappoint me!

Monch:
Of course. Please rest assured...

Monch:
When all is said and done, I will make sure you will get your time in the limelight.

Enya:
'The sound of the bell rings from Her purest soul. Those who love Her cast their heads down to listen, and Kjeragandr shines her countenance upon all Her faithful children.'

Enya:
—Listen. The bells of the hour have chimed.

Enya:
You were almost late, Sir Enciodes.

Enciodes:
I beg forgiveness.

Enciodes:
The path of enlightenment is always a treacherous one. This, too, must be one of Kjeragandr's trials for the Silverashes.

Enya:
You walked all the way from Turicum to Mount Karlan. It must have been an exhausting journey.

Enya:
However... I hope you will find your right path forward.

Enciodes:
With your blessings, Great Saintess, the path ahead is shrouded no more.

Enciodes:
Even as we speak, I am making my way toward Kjeragandr's teachings.

Enya:
......

Enya:
You have a fine way with words, Sir Enciodes.

Enciodes:
You flatter me.

Enciodes:
I am profoundly humbled to be welcomed by the Great Saintess herself.

Enya:
With the pomp and circumstance of your entrance, I wouldn't dare to give you the cold shoulder, Sir Enciodes.

Enciodes:
Where can I find the Great Elder, if I may ask?

Enya:
The Great Elder is preparing for the ceremony. Such is why I'm here to receive you myself.

Enya:
For this Holy Hunt, I shall follow Kjeragandr's will and stand alongside you to bring this ceremony to a successful conclusion.

Enciodes:
You mean... you will personally take to the hunting grounds?

Enciodes:
......

Enya:
Do you too think my decision is a rash one, Sir Enciodes?

Enciodes:
Not in the slightest.

Enciodes:
I'm simply overcome with emotion. It seems you have come to realize the gravity of your position as leader of the three clans. It's a fortunate thing for Kjerag.

Enya:
It's my responsibility.

Enciodes:
......

Enya:
......

Servant:
Great Saintess, Sir Enciodes, the Holy Hunt will begin shortly. Please hurry.

Enya:
It's nearly time.

Enya:
Please come with me, Sir Enciodes.

Enciodes:
After you, Great Saintess.

Enya:
......

Enya:
Sir Enciodes.

Enciodes:
What is it?

Enya:
Whether your path is right or wrong, Kjerag has its own path to follow.

Enya:
No one can decide for all of Kjeragandr's children.

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
I feel the same way...

Enciodes:
Our merits are not for others to judge. Now that things have come to this, there is no reason for me to back away. With my actions...

Enciodes:
—I did all that I could, nothing more.

Enya:
By Kjeragandr.

Enya:
I, as Saintess, hereby declare.

Enya:
I shall lead Kjerag's finest warriors to find and lay waste to all the Tschäggättä hiding in the mountains, so that Kjerag may have peace.

Arctosz:
By Kjeragandr.

Arctosz:
I, Arctosz, as always, will lead my warriors of the house of Paleroche, following the Saintess in her quest to find all Tschäggättä hiding in the mountains.

Arctosz:
And to bring back the most magnificent prey.

Ratatos:
By Kjeragandr.

Ratatos:
I, Ratatos, as always, will lead my warriors of the house of Browntail, following the Saintess in her quest to hunt down all Tschäggättä hiding in the mountains.

Ratatos:
And to bring back the most exquisite prey.

Enciodes:
By Kjeragandr.

Enciodes:
I, Enciodes, as always, will lead my warriors of the house of Silverash, following the Saintess in her quest to suppress all Tschäggättä hiding in the mountains.

Enciodes:
And to bring back the most ferocious prey.

Enya:
May our faith reach Kjeragandr, and may prosperity reach Kjerag.

Great Elder:
May our faith reach Kjeragandr, and may prosperity reach Kjerag...

Tri-Clan Leaders:
May our faith reach Kjeragandr, and may prosperity reach Kjerag.

Everyone in Attendance:
—May our faith reach Kjeragandr, and may prosperity reach Kjerag!

Enya:
Everyone, please check your equipment.

Enya:
Let the hunt begin!
