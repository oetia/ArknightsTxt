Neighbor:
Lara, you're a lovely one to your family, helping with work the second you're back.

Aurora:
No, I'm just doing what I should. I'd love to take a good look around too.

Neighbor:
Ah, it really does change once you study outside. Far better head on you than my little brother.

Neighbor:
What a wonderful girl you are. Shame.

Neighbor:
Who knows if I'll ever find one as nice as you again after I move.

Aurora:
Wait, Sasa, you've been living fine here all this time, right? Why the move?

Neighbor:
My dad, you know. Yesterday at the Tri-Clan Council, they announced the Saintess would lead the three, right?

Neighbor:
Now Dad's all fired up.

Aurora:
Oh... Uncle Zoer was always against Sir Enciodes's open door policy...

Neighbor:
Right? We all moved here from up north back then so my brother and I could get work.

Neighbor:
And here, Dad pretty much got used to it, over the years.

Neighbor:
And now they announce the resignation yesterday, and he's over the moons.

Neighbor:
At dinner last night, he was going on and on, mad at Sir Enciodes for everything he'd done these years, and I was fed up hearing it. I even had an argument with him.

Neighbor:
But you can't change his mind in the end. We might end up moving straight back to the Paleroches' territory.

Aurora:
So what about your brother's job?

Neighbor:
Who knows? Once the resignation's through, it's up in the air if Turicum can still do business like before.

Neighbor:
I heard the Paleroches say. See, in the first place, it was the Saintess last Council who wanted Sir Enciodes handing the valleys and mines over.

Neighbor:
If she's going to govern Kjerag, Sir Enciodes probably isn't getting any favors.

Aurora:
That's true.

Neighbor:
It's a good thing too, though.

Neighbor:
You might've missed it, being outside so long, but the three clans got along fine at first. It's just lately, they've fallen out more and more with each other.

Neighbor:
A lot of people were scared, after last Council, we'd get into a full-blown war.

Aurora:
Yeah, it's amazing how Sir Enciodes yielded on this. And he's putting power with the Saintess.

Neighbor:
Yeah. Just, it should've happened long ago, if you ask me. I don't hate his open door policy, seeing as our family made a good living from it too.

Neighbor:
But sometimes it really does feel like the old people say, how Kjerag's not like Kjerag anymore.

Neighbor:
Him deciding to give way now and make less of a fuss, everyone approves of that.

Neighbor:
It's just old grumps like your big brother against it.

Aurora:
My brother...

Aurora:
I'm back.

Aurora's Sister:
Oh, you silly kid. Told you to relax once you got home, but you just had to work.

Aurora's Sister:
(Softly) You and your ore-pathy thing. You might not feel bad about your health, but we still hurt over it.

Aurora:
It's alright, Sis. A bit of work like this won't get in the way.

Aurora:
Um, where's Bro?

Aurora's Sister:
He said he was heading to the factory just now, and went out all in a hurry. Said he wouldn't be back today, either.

Aurora:
The factory?

Aurora:
Is that the Captain?

Aurora:
Captain, is something up?

Sharp:
Vacation's over, Aurora.

Sharp:
The Doctor got nabbed at the station by the Paleroche family yesterday.

Aurora:
Huh?!

Sharp:
Doctor went with them, voluntarily. You should get what I mean. Likely some sort of plan ticking under that hood.

Sharp:
I took a rough look at the map. Takes some time from the station to the Paleroches'.

Sharp:
The Doctor should've gotten there by now, and we ought to be on our way.

Sharp:
I'm using the pretext to head to yours now to check the situation, then I'll come out and converge with you.

Aurora:
Got it.

Aurora:
I guess I'll go rendezvous with the Captain, then.

Kjera:
I see. So you're the one from Rhodes Island.

Kjera:
Correct.

Kjera:
You're very unique, but I don't know why it is you're so unique.

Kjera:
Hm?

Kjera:
It was no more than a word of advice.

Kjera:
You see? Aren't you under the watch of a group of strangers, unfree to even stroll outside?

Kjera:
Before I answer your question, tell me first. For what reason did you come to Kjerag?

Kjera:
So in other words, you're Enciodes's friend?

Kjera:
Mending the three Silverashes' relations?

Kjera:
You speak some hefty words.

Kjera:
Then your luck is tragic, being drawn into a mess like this without rhyme or reason.

Kjera:
Yet it's beyond me, believing someone who can be so carefree in these circumstances is truly here on a tourist's plan.

Kjera:
I'm very curious—how outsiders like you regard this land of Kjerag.

Kjera:
Peaceful... yes, it's been peaceful here for over a thousand years by now.

Kjera:
And peace of mind signifies stagnation.

Kjera:
Kjerag's people are too used to this status quo, to the point they don't care what happens outside, nor have any interest in it.

Kjera:
It should be a good thing by all rights, but lately, I've felt... *sigh*...

Kjera:
In the end, their belief in Kjeragandr is the root of what condenses the people in this land together.

Kjera:
But at times, I've felt the people are somewhat too dependent on belief.

Kjera:
Can you sympathize? You tell every worry you have to the divine, hoping they'll come to help solve things, and so you turn—

Kjera:
Though, so clearly, you should use your own willpower to change circumstances, you just take divine will as an excuse to stagnate.

Kjera:
Though, so clearly, you till by your own hands to gain your harvest, you still thank the divine for their generosity after the fact.

Kjera:
Though, so clearly, making the choices, putting in the effort, should be for each person's own...

Kjera:
You're very forthcoming.

Kjera:
But most people like you, outsiders... in modern terms, 'foreigners,' hold such a view.

Kjera:
The people outside long since developed plenty to grant them idleness, or in other words, labor-saving technology.

Kjera:
They're accustomed to a convenient life, while most Kjerag folk have never heard of such things.

Kjera:
Maybe the people of Kjerag really can forge diligence and courage out of a harder life, can learn of belief and virtue in an environment far from all the pleasures.

Kjera:
But I also don't feel it should continue for eternity.

Kjera:
The people of Kjerag broke ground on a haven between these snowy mounts, but can they preserve their homeland's solidity and stability forever on tradition alone?

Kjera:
The way you see it, should Kjerag change?

Kjera:
Ah, so you think so too?

Kjera:
Anyone with a sharp eye could tell, honestly, that the transformation Enciodes brought can't be stopped.

Kjera:
Who can so easily decline their own life becoming a little less heavy, a little more convenient?

Kjera:
And here I thought you'd say, everything backwards here should be changed.

Kjera:
I've heard countless people say things like yours already.

Kjera:
And those people, by and large, are those born and raised in Kjerag.

Kjera:
How cautious.

Kjera:
But I don't mind the cautious at all.

Kjera:
It's just a shame. You probably have little time left to learn how this present country manifests.

Kjera:
I...

Kjera:
I have a friend.

Kjera:
This friend has been thinking, all this time, about how to finally change Kjerag for the better.

Kjera:
However, she's thought for a long time, and can't come up with an answer.

Kjera:
She's gradually realized that everyone thinks different to her, and their mindsets, no matter who they are, all disturb her.

Kjera:
She wants to do something, but every time she wants to, there's always someone advising against her.

Kjera:
And now, she finds, she's become slowly unable to stop what those people wish to do.

Kjera:
And it's in this moment you've arrived.

Kjera:
Omen? Perhaps any port in a storm is a more fitting description.

Kjera:
An invitee of Enciodes, come from outer lands. The spectrum and scent of you give me an otherly feeling, peculiar and novel—

Kjera:
Tell me, stranger, what does your arrival portend?

Ensia:
Come on, I only got her last letter not long ago. Seriously, it's like she hasn't written in forever. She's on my case like this every time.

Ensia:
Thank you, Kjarr. You're always the one handing me my sister's letters.

Kjarr:
It's alright. The Great Saintess can't descend at will, so I go out and about in her place, and bring back outside news to her. It's as she desires, too.

Ensia:
Sorry, though, I've got no room to write a letter back for now. I'm about to get ready for something else.

Kjarr:
Based on the bag next to you... you're going to head outdoors?

Ensia:
Yep.

Kjarr:
Where are you going? To climb Jungfrau?

Ensia:
Come on, I forgot until you mentioned it! I still haven't conquered Jungfrau!

Ensia:
But where I'm going is to the valleys this time.

Kjarr:
The valleys? Aren't they about to be handed over to the Vine-Bear Court? And there're so many factories there, too. What are you going to do?

Ensia:
The Doctor's gonna head there, which means I have someone to see. Oh, Kjarr, you have no idea who I'm talking about, do you?

Kjarr:
Ah, I do believe I've heard tell. The guest taken away by the Paleroches?

Ensia:
Mm-hm. My guest in the first place, concern for the Doctor's safety is really weighing on me.

Kjarr:
You're such a good girl.

Kjarr:
But take care. I hear things haven't been too calm there lately.

Ensia:
Mm-hm.

Matterhorn:
Lady Ensia, we can depart now.

Matterhorn:
Worry not. All responsibility will lie with me on this departure.

Ensia:
You're a huge help, Uncle.

Matterhorn:
It's rare you ask me to help you with things. How would I ever refuse this?

Ensia:
Kjarr, I might be gone for a little long while. If you can, go back and tell my sister I'll reply to her after I'm done.

Kjarr:
It's quite alright, I can wait.

Sharp:
Aurora, I need info to make judgment calls, especially your views as a local. Tell me how you see the Doctor's current situation.

Aurora:
Gnosis was likely in a very sensitive position, given he was formerly in charge of the mines and valleys.

Aurora:
Sir Enciodes putting the Doctor in that same position now is bound to draw Arctosz's attention.

Sharp:
Tell me in detail about why the mines and valleys are such a sensitive area.

Aurora:
Hmm... it'd be more convenient if we had a map on hand.

Aurora:
Kjerag's topography isn't too complicated, and it's not very finely partitioned either.

Aurora:
Usually, us locals just call each area the mines, valleys, woodlands, lakes, mountains, creeks, and plains.

Aurora:
The creeks and plains, and most of the lakes, are the Paleroches' in the north.

Aurora:
The Browntails in the west are mainly the woodlands, and the minority of the lakes.

Aurora:
The Silverashes are mainly the mountains, valleys and mines. They have so little of the lakes, you can essentially ignore it.

Aurora:
And the valleys and mines... actually, they represent nearly half of the Silverashes' territory already.

Aurora:
Between them, the mines have always been incredibly important land to the Silverashes, because practically all the ore used in Kjerag comes from there.

Aurora:
While the valleys were only developed in recent years.

Aurora:
Originally, they were extremely poor land to work, and there weren't more than a few hamlets. People always considered it an area with no use.

Aurora:
But after Sir Enciodes founded Karlan Trade, he chose that land to use for siting factories.

Aurora:
The majority of Karlan Trade's manufacturing is built there, and it's extremely close to Mount Karlan, too.

Aurora:
On top of that, I exchanged some info with Kjerag merchants before we left—but everyone who comes outside to do business is related to Karlan Trade in some way.

Aurora:
A month ago, with the Great Saintess's backing, the Browntails and Paleroches requested and organized a team to investigate health and safety issues at the factories.

Aurora:
But the team met a surprise attack secretly ordered by Gnosis, who wouldn't play along at all. I don't know how that info came out, but everyone believes Gnosis was involved in it.

Aurora:
That led to the Paleroches' head, Arctosz, getting inspiration from the Vine-Bear Court to send troops to station in the valleys, and it's because of the consequences of Gnosis's extreme actions that he was finally removed.

Sharp:
At the meeting, the Doctor mentioned Enciodes's reason for making the invitation.

Sharp:
We do help construct Oripathy-related facilities for Karlan Trade, but he never mentioned having the Doctor manage anything in his place before.

Sharp:
Which is to say, the Doctor's actively climbed onto the scales of this conspiracy. Very Doctor-like to do.

Aurora:
That seems likely, but Karlan Trade and Rhodes Island have a perfectly fine relationship, and the Doctor would probably only accept because of that relationship.

Aurora:
For now, I can't imagine the reason why Sir Enciodes would want to set up the Doctor...

Aurora:
What do we do now? Contact Dr. Kal'tsit?

Sharp:
The landship's headed for Victoria. We'd need the use of a local large-scale comms station, because our handheld equipment's got no way to get in touch.

Sharp:
(Breathes a long sigh)

Aurora:
Captain...?

Sharp:
I surveyed for a stretch. Guard force at the Doctor's present placement is low-strength.

Sharp:
The Paleroche residence should have about two hundred in guards, training and arms not up to outside army standard. We can break through on a surprise raid.

Sharp:
I've checked surrounding terrain too. Alternate plan is we infiltrate, but that needs setting up explosives in multiple locations beforehand.

Sharp:
Going in and pulling out both need manufactured explosions to draw attention. There're some points in the wall structure that'll let...

Aurora:
Wait! Captain!

Sharp:
Hm?

Aurora:
I feel like... things aren't going to get to that point.

Sharp:
No matter what happens, we need to ensure the Doctor's safety. That's our first priority.

Aurora:
...I agree with that, but...

Aurora:
If we bring force against the house of Paleroche in the run-up to the Grand Ceremony, then I'm worried Rhodes Island will end up an enemy of Mount Karlan.

Aurora:
What will the Kjerag operators at Rhodes Island do?

Sharp:
I need to consider the worst-case scenario, and the least honorable way of solving things. The present outlook is pessimistic, and if I have to make a choice, you know I'll only choose the Doctor.

Sharp:
We all hope things won't go that far, but you know as well as I that it doesn't depend on us, and I have a responsibility to the Doctor and Rhodes Island.

Aurora:
I just can't shake the sense that... Sir Enciodes probably has his own plans.

Aurora:
The Doctor chose to play them at their own game, so some kind of clue must've been there long ago, and the Doctor's already prepped to deal with it...

Sharp:
I've never doubted the Doctor's abilities for a moment. I believe.

Sharp:
But I need to make my own preparations beforehand. The Doctor put me on standby, so there's a place for us in the plan.

Aurora:
We need to get in touch with the Doctor first.

Sharp:
Aurora.

Aurora:
Hm?

Sharp:
You respect Enciodes a lot.

Aurora:
Yes... Without him, I would've never been able to leave Kjerag, and come into contact with the outside world.

Sharp:
Understandable.

Sharp:
But for the moment, I want you to forget that. Starting now, you treat him as a hypothetical enemy. Can you do that?

Sharp:
If you feel like you can't, you can head back right now. I won't blame you.

Aurora:
But at the same time, I'm an employee of Rhodes Island too.

Sharp:
Remember what you've just said.

Aurora:
Understood.

Aurora:
But... do we have to watch out for Cliffheart and the rest too?

Sharp:
I trust Cliffheart, but have no confidence in Ensia Silverash.

Sharp:
For now. We figure how to meet up with the Doctor.

Kjarr:
You're the Doctor's subordinates?

Sharp:
...(Slash)

In an instant, a hardened steel blade streaks through air, stopping just a hair's width from the woman's neck.

Kjarr:
Wow, that's a rare way to use a sword here.

Sharp:
Who are you?

Kjarr:
Well, there's no need to be this ferocious to an ordinary girl you've just met.

Sharp:
Pinning this position, and cracking a joke in this context? Does that make you an ordinary girl?

Kjarr:
Put the blade down first! Your Rhodes Island Doctor sent me.

Kjarr:
I was asked to bring you a message.
