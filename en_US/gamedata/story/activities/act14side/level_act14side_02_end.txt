Sciurus:
Well, well, you actually came to us Browntails' territory for a visit all by your lonesome. You got balls, Gnosis Edelweiss.

Gnosis:
I've always been upright and honorable.

Sciurus:
Hmph, that's rich coming from you after you were kicked out of Karlan Trade for your shady business.

Gnosis:
I thought I'd see Ratatos here.

Sciurus:
Anyone could bluff like that. Ratatos wasn't going to just take your word so easily.

Gnosis:
......

Gnosis:
As I said before, it takes two to cooperate. It seems my words have reached her, and that's more than enough to me.

Sciurus:
Hmph, talk all you want.

Sciurus:
So, since you came here all by yourself... You said last time 'things have come to this.' What's that all about?

Sciurus:
What things have come to what?

Gnosis:
*Sigh*.

Gnosis:
Why do you think Enciodes proposed this transfer of powers?

Sciurus:
Hmph, isn't that because he can't take on both the Paleroches and us, and so he figured to compromise?

Gnosis:
Compromise?

Gnosis:
Hoh, compromise.

Gnosis:
Think again, Madame Sciurus. I dare say that your sister thinks otherwise.

Gnosis:
Ever since Enciodes came back to Kjerag, was there any single thing he did that wasn't in pursuit of his ultimate victory? Is his proposal to put the Saintess back in power really a compromise?

Sciurus:
......

Gnosis:
Here's a hint—The Ceremony.

Sciurus:
Hm...? What about the Ceremony? Don't tell me he's going to throw a fit there and refuse to turn over his powers.

Gnosis:
The Ceremony is nigh, and there will be more trains coming in and out of the Silverashes' territory transporting both resources and people.

Gnosis:
Take a guess, why did Enciodes himself propose to hand the Saintess his powers, even arranging for it to happen on the day of the Ceremony?

Gnosis:
Arctosz's a short-sighted man. He thinks Enciodes will pull some kind of dirty trick once she's in control.

Gnosis:
And so he reassigned his men to guard the valleys and the mines, even to keep an eye on the Doctor that Enciodes invited.

Gnosis:
But the funny thing is that he doesn't know it's all pointless!

Sciurus:
......!

Sciurus looks to a corner of the room for a brief moment. There is nothing there, but Gnosis notices it.

Gnosis looks straight at the wall there.

Gnosis:
Ratatos, you can't be that stupid.

Gnosis:
I will tell you what Enciodes is planning.

Gnosis:
But you'd better see me yourself next time.

Gnosis:
Even if I have to see his schemes come to fruition and you two imprisoned—

Gnosis:
I won't allow myself be made a fool of again.

Wallboards:
......

Gnosis:
Now excuse me.

Sciurus:
Ratatos...

Sciurus:
Hey, Ratatos! I know you're there!

Wallboards:
Pipe down, Sciurus.

There is a rumbling noise, and the wallboard slowly moves to the side. Ratatos, sitting inside, slowly rises and steps out.

Sciurus:
You believe in what he said?

Ratatos:
Maybe I should say I'm shocked that you never considered the possibility, sister.

Sciurus:
But even the Saintess is on our side now!

Sciurus:
Can Enciodes really be so unscrupulous that he...

Ratatos:
That he...?

Ratatos:
Don't be silly, Sciurus.

Ratatos:
From the moment he first trampled our faith, when he laid his train tracks straight to Kjerag and broke away from the Saintess...

Ratatos:
No, ever since he so calmly agreed to let his sister become the Saintess in exchange for his seat in the Tri-Clan Council, he hasn't cared.

Ratatos:
We all know how well those siblings got along in their earlier years. I also once thought that letting the devout Enya become the Vine-Bear Court's hostage was a brilliant move.

Ratatos:
But now? Hmph, I wouldn't be surprised if he one day brought his men up the mountain to burn down the whole Vine-Bear Court.

Sciurus:
Don't tell me Enciodes is really going to use force...

Ratatos:
Slow down, sister.

Ratatos:
There's another possibility. He could be pulling our leg.

Sciurus:
Why...?

Ratatos:
To make us think he's up to something shady so we end up making the first move.

Sciurus:
What good does that do him?

Ratatos:
If he's not trying to have somebody else do his dirty work and off his enemies, he's trying to find an excuse to start a war and earn himself some clout in the end.

Ratatos:
Hmph, whatever it is, we're probably all in trouble.

Sciurus:
Well...

Sciurus:
How do we figure this out?

Ratatos:
No idea.

Sciurus:
None at all?

Ratatos:
I'm not exactly omniscient here.

Ratatos:
But if he's lying, there's got to be holes.

Ratatos:
You.

Browntail Family Noble:
Your orders, Matriarch?

Ratatos:
Dig up anything you can find on Gnosis. We looked into him before, but he's had lots of dealings since his job got handed off. There should be a lot more clues now. Start there.

Browntail Family Noble:
Understood.

Ratatos:
You'd better not disappoint me, Gnosis Edelweiss.

Sciurus:
Ratatos... If he was telling the truth, would you really take him in?

Ratatos:
Why not?

Sciurus:
He's an Edelweiss! The family who got Enciodes's father killed fifteen years ago!

Ratatos:
So what?

Sciurus:
They betrayed the Silverashes, but when Enciodes came back from studying in Victoria, this guy tagged along, wanting a slice of the pie.

Sciurus:
If you ask me, he's the type who doesn't give two licks about loyalty, only profit and success. Now that he's made an enemy of his master, he's got to find a new sugar daddy to get his revenge.

Ratatos:
Right, that's the most obvious reason.

Sciurus:
So you...

Ratatos:
Sciurus... 'The Silverashes control the gates, the Paleroches have their rich farmlands and their army, but the Browntails have nothing. Why do you think we stand as one of Kjerag's three families?'

Sciurus:
'...Because what we do earns the highest return.'

Sciurus:
I learned Grandpa's lessons just as well as you did.

Ratatos:
Right, since I'm letting you in, there are lots of things that you really must spend some time pondering.

Ratatos:
As a child of the Browntails, in times like these, you need to know the best course of action. It's more than just knowing the risks of dealing with a criminal. You need to learn to assess all this yourself.

Ratatos:
Profit always comes with risks. We need to learn how to mitigate these risks beyond just shutting them out along with the profits, dear sister.

Ratatos:
Our biggest worry is that everything he just said was true, but also part of a lie.

Ratatos:
Another thing.

Ratatos:
You've gotten really close with that servant of yours, haven't you?

Sciurus:
You mean Monch?

Ratatos:
Monch, conch, gonch, whatever.

Ratatos:
Don't trust anyone too much, sister.

Sciurus:
Grr, I don't need you to tell me what to do!

Sciurus:
I'll show you how much stronger I can make Browntails without you!

Ratatos:
*Sigh*... I should never have given Enciodes this chance.

Ratatos:
I have that braindead moron Arctosz to thank. Take Enya away from her scumbag brother? Don't make me laugh.

Ratatos:
Whatever. Yucatan.

Yucatan:
Yes, Matriarch?

Ratatos:
Let the Paleroches know that I'll visit in a few days.

Yucatan:
Of course.

Valais:
Doctor, we've entered the valley.

Valais:
Sorry... Sir Arctosz never permitted any rail tracks to be built in the Paleroches' territory, and it's not in our habit to use cars.

Valais:
I suppose it may not be easy for a foreigner like you to ride a burdenbeast.

Chester:
Dr. {@nickname}, welcome. I am Sir Enciodes's secretary, Chester.

Chester:
Please allow me to accompany you as you survey the area.

Chester:
To give Sir Arctosz the absolute peace of mind, we'll ask you to inspect each and every factory and mine site before they're declared closed.

Chester:
Once you have checked everything here, both Sir Arctosz and the Great Elder will give their approval. Only then will the transfer be considered complete.

Chester:
What do you think, General Valais?

Valais:
That would be for the best, of course.

Chester:
In that case, please follow me. We'll take stroll and get a grasp of the environment and situation here.

Senior Subject:
Still, this is just way too sudden...

Young Subject:
Right, I had heard there was bad news from the last Tri-Clan Council. But that's not enough to send us running.

Senior Subject:
My son was hurt while working in the factory not too long ago. I'm still waiting for his medical subsidy.

Senior Subject:
We... We've always believed in Sir Enciodes! He's not going to abandon us, is he?

Young Subject:
All of us put in so much work to improve the Kjerag's livelihood. He can't just shut the factory down like that!

Infected Subject:
What about Infected like us? We finally found work at the factory...

Weiss:
Please, everyone, calm down. Listen to me—

Weiss:
Oh, nice timing, Doctor.

Weiss:
It's been a while. I'm really sorry that we dragged you into our local affairs.

Weiss:
Please bear with it for a little longer. Once the Ceremony is over, the Silverashes will properly receive you.

Weiss:
But, before that, I think I might need your help with something.

Weiss:
......

Weiss:
Sharp as always, Doctor.

Weiss:
Don't be so humble, Doctor. Your abilities are on another level. I've seen for myself.

Weiss:
And we'll need your help with many other things as well.

Weiss:
Well then, I'll need to borrow the Doctor for this job of mine. Just for a bit. Would the Paleroches mind?

Valais:
By all means.

Weiss:
Friends and countrymen, Sir Enciodes has personally instructed me to offer all those affected an explanation on his behalf.

Weiss:
It so happens that the Doctor is here too. The Doctor is Sir Enciodes's esteemed guest, and Karlan Trade's current chief technical officer.

Weiss:
Today, together with all of you, our guest will bear witness to this message:

Weiss:
At the Tri-Clan Council, the great houses and the Vine-Bear Court reached an understanding for the interim, and will begin discussion on any follow-up matters.

Weiss:
Because of the grave mistakes made by Gnosis, the previous CTO, Karlan Trade must shut down all of its factories in a show of goodwill.

Weiss:
Once the transfer of powers is complete, the Silverash family will actively work with the Vine-Bear Court and advocate for a gradual reopening of some of our factories in a controlled, carefully-planned manner.

Valais:
Hmph...

Weiss:
......

Weiss:
Please trust me and trust the Silverash family that this is for the best.

Weiss:
Now, as I introduced earlier, and will emphasize once more, this is Sir Enciodes's esteemed guest as well as Karlan Trade's current CTO.

Weiss:
Our guest is a master not only of the production and mining technologies that we are all familiar with, but also the prevention and treatment of Oripathy.

Weiss:
The Doctor likewise represents a medical organization that will help Karlan Trade answer the critical questions that we are all struggling with, including the medical support issue we were just discussing.

Weiss:
Such things would not be possible in our mountains of yore, and, together with the Doctor, Karlan Trade will bring about this new future.

Weiss:
At the same time, it is Sir Enciodes's wish for the territorial subjects of the other two houses to cast aside their differences and help us build Kjerag.

Weiss:
There is no need for panic. Please put your faith in Sir Enciodes and the Saintess. Have faith that Kjeragandr will never abandon Her children.

Senior Subject:
Aah, by Kjeragandr!

Young Subject:
By Kjeragandr.

Weiss:
By Kjeragandr.

Weiss:
Now then, I will...

Infected Subject:
Wait! Hold on a minute!

Infected Subject:
After hearing you out... I-I have something to say!

Weiss:
Please.

Infected Subject:
It's not that we don't trust the other two houses.

Infected Subject:
It's just we've really had it fairly nice the last couple years thanks to Sir Enciodes. We have work, we get enough food to eat, and we even get painkillers.

Infected Subject:
We never had it so easy before...

Infected Subject:
Since we heard the factory was going to be shut down, we've all been worried that the good times are coming to an end...

Weiss:
Please rest assured.

Weiss:
The Doctor, as I introduced just now, is an Oripathy scholar. Karlan Trade invited the Doctor here precisely because we are concerned about our Infected workforce's livelihood.

Weiss:
So please put your faith in us, Karlan Trade.

Weiss:
Yes, is there something you would like to add, Doctor?

Weiss:
There are also those of the mind that his ideas are impractical.

Weiss:
My apologies. I have misspoken.

Weiss:
......

Weiss:
*Sigh*... Very well. Looks like I'm not going to fool you, Doctor.

Senior Subject:
Ugh...

Weiss:
So merciless, Doctor.

Weiss:
Friends, it's true. I am not done yet.

Weiss:
We didn't keep our internal affairs in check, and that led to you losing your jobs. That is entirely our fault.

Weiss:
Karlan Trade promises to keep your original positions unfilled. You will continue to be compensated, and we will arrange job opportunities with equal or even greater pay and benefits.

Weiss:
And I am sure you can already tell that, unlike Gnosis, the Doctor actually understands what you truly need.

Weiss:
The Doctor will bring Karlan Trade the technologies that will truly benefit our day-to-day lives.

Weiss:
Right, this is what Sir Enciodes truly wanted all of us to know!

Young Subject:
Sound great! I'll head back and let everybody know!

Senior Subject:
Good, that's very good, but don't forget Kjeragandr's teachings, young man...

Weiss:
Phew...

Chester:
Good work.

Weiss:
Not at all. It's my job to speak for him.

Weiss:
Thank you, Doctor.

Weiss:
But I'm sure you'll agree that this was worth helping?

Weiss:
Okay, Doctor... I'll take you out for some fondue. My treat.

Weiss:
Not at all, Doctor.

Weiss:
Actually, if it wasn't for you, I probably would've forgotten to say all that.

Weiss:
Okay, I will take my leave now.

Weiss:
Yes?

Weiss:
......

Weiss:
I'm not sure what you are talking about, Doctor.

Monch:
......

Monch:
All the requirements have been met, just as Madame Sciurus expected.

Monch:
Enciodes sent Weiss presumably as some kind of insurance policy.

Monch:
But that's not nearly enough.

Monch:
You are to ensure that things go according to Madame Sciurus's plans once Weiss is gone.

Kjerag Warriors:
Yes!

Monch:
......

Gnosis:
You were followed.

Monch:
......!

Monch:
What?! I didn't...

Gnosis:
There was only one of them, now long gone, running after the men Sciurus assigned to you.

Monch:
I'm very sorry for betraying your expectations, Sir Gnosis.

Gnosis:
No, perhaps this is for the better.

Monch:
I'm prepared to be your pawn and to do whatever you say.

Gnosis:
I'm just a researcher, Monch.

Gnosis:
Pawns are meaningless to me. What I want is a partner that I can work with.

Monch:
......

Gnosis:
Proceed with the plan. Don't worry. Ratatos and Sciurus won't catch you.

Monch:
Understood.
