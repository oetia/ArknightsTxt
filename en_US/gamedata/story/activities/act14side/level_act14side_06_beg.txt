Kjarr:
He's not sending any men after the other clans. He's just guarding the Vine-Bear Court.

Kjarr:
Right, he's guarding the Vine-Bear Court.

Kjarr:
Now he's truly seized the Court.

Kjarr:
*Sigh*... You're right about that.

Kjarr:
Even I understand the way Enciodes does things now.

Kjarr:
Him handing back power is all a feint. He wanted to flip the whole table over all along.

Kjarr:
Right. Most of us thought he had no way to overcome the Kjerag people's faith for Kjeragandr. They thought he didn't have what it takes.

Kjarr:
The Great Elder, Ratatos, Arctosz... even I thought so.

Kjarr:
And he knew that.

Kjarr:
That said, I've been wondering about one thing.

Kjarr:
A life without God. Does that necessarily mean there should be no gods?

Kjarr:
Oh, I'm just musing. I'm not depressed at all.

Kjarr:
Faith is gradually becoming an obstacle... At the very least, that's how the Kjerag people's faith in Kjeragandr is. I've known that for a long time now.

Kjarr:
Thank you, though.

Kjarr:
*Sigh*... Not that this has anything to do with me, a lowly maid who serves the Saintess.

Kjarr:
Speaking of which, I thought you'd ask me why I'm here with you.

Kjarr:
Just like you have many reasons to choose to interfere, right?

Kjarr:
Thank you, Doctor...

Kjarr:
I will stand firm with my choice, and I hope you will too.

Sharp:
Doctor, the work is done.

Sharp:
I couldn't keep the clan leaders. Ratatos asked me to give you her thanks, but it looks like she's got her own plans. She went back to her territory.

Sharp:
Arctosz's heading back to his place, too. Looks like he's gathering his forces to fight it out with Enciodes.

Aurora:
Doctor, if we let them go back to their lands, won't that lead inevitably to death?

Sharp:
What the Doctor's saying is that, with how furious the crowd was, they would most likely have gotten a death sentence right there and then if the two of them were caught.

Sharp:
And even if that wasn't the case, they would still no doubt stand trial.

Kjarr:
The two of them may be labeled traitors, but the two families' subordinates, especially the Paleroches, won't buy that so easily.

Kjarr:
And regardless of whether they take up arms or start infighting, Kjerag will fall into chaos.

Sharp:
But whichever it is, Enciodes will be the righteous one.

Sharp:
To him, even if things start out chaotic and there are considerable casualties during the process, the whole mess can be still be cleaned up in the end.

Aurora:
......

Sharp:
Right, Enciodes went through all that trouble to shape this situation. That means he cares about the masses.

Sharp:
When I bummed around Karlan Trade, I heard a thing or two about his methods. Most of the staff there thinks he's got foresight.

Sharp:
And now that he chose to stir the pot out in the open like that? You can tell it's his best option despite all the risks it comes with.

Aurora:
I... I sure hope so.

Sharp:
The Silverashes and the Browntails were on better terms in the past. Naturally, he's planted more than a few of his pawns who can help control the chaos.

Sharp:
The problem is still the Paleroches. Their equipment and combat prowess may be behind the times, but their numbers are no joke.

Kjarr:
Right, and the Silverashes have always been on pretty bad terms with them.

Kjarr:
Besides, the Paleroches' men are all very loyal. It's hard to say they'll betray the Paleroche clan even with everything that has transpired.

Sharp:
That's why I can understand why the Doctor decided to help the two of them.

Sharp:
A family can only come together if the family head's still alive, and as long as we can influence the leaders in some way, the Doctor can still pull off some rough plan.

Sharp:
Still though, Doctor, I guess I don't have to say itâ€”

Sharp:
Kjerag's got some complex terrain. It's not easy to get around here. We don't have much time.

Browntail Family Noble:
Sorry for the wait, Matriarch.

Ratatos:
Sorry that you have to help me now, of all times.

Browntail Family Noble:
Don't mention it. I am a Browntail. This is exactly the time I should stand with my Matriarch.

Ratatos:
Do you believe anything Enciodes said?

Browntail Family Noble:
Of course not. He has to be framing you.

Ratatos:
......

Ratatos:
How go the preparations?

Browntail Family Noble:
It'll take some time to get back to the Browntail territory from Silverash lands, though I have a car ready, and I pulled a few strings.

Browntail Family Noble:
Once you and Madame Sciurus are ready, I will make sure you two are taken back to the our land.

Ratatos:
Any news from back home?

Browntail Family Noble:
After word about the ceremony got out, a few towns near our territory's border started flying the Silverashes' flag.

Browntail Family Noble:
There's nothing like that toward the center, but...

Ratatos:
Enough. I have a decent idea of how many men he planted inside our family. With how many of them there are, I'm afraid I won't be able to count all of them when they're all gathered in one spot.

Ratatos:
Has Enciodes been up to anything?

Browntail Family Noble:
The Silverashes have set up camp at the foot of Mount Karlan and on the mountainside.

Ratatos:
Hmph, at least he's a man of his word.

Browntail Family Noble:
The populace there has been very receptive to him too. Absolutely shameless.

Ratatos:
They saw Arctosz's betrayal at the ceremony with their own eyes, after all.

Ratatos:
Hmph, out of everyone who doesn't trust Arctosz, it's gotta be those who saw his 'crimes' with their own eyes that don't trust him the most.

Ratatos:
Let's not talk about him. What about you? What are you getting from Enciodes?

Browntail Family Noble:
I... I don't follow...?

Ratatos:
Drop it already. Your acting's terrible.

Browntail Family Noble:
Come on out and... Arrest Ratatos.

Browntail Family Noble:
......

Browntail Family Noble:
......?!

Browntail Family Noble:
Gah...

Ratatos:
If I couldn't see through that trap of yours, then I had no business leading our clan.

Sciurus:
Ratatos, I heard the car's...

Sciurus:
What's going on here?!

Ratatos:
Take a guess?

Sciurus:
He was going to sell us out?!

Ratatos:
Looks like you're not as stupid as I made you out to be, dear sister.

Sciurus:
Do you have to mock me, even at a time like this?

Sciurus:
How many are still on our side?

Ratatos:
How many? Right, how many...?

Ratatos:
Sciurus, do you understand what a big mess you've caused?

Sciurus:
I...

Sciurus:
I never thought...

Ratatos:
*Sigh*... That's exactly the problem. You never thought. You never think.

Sciurus:
What was I supposed to do?! I... I just wanted to show everyone that I can do something for the Browntails too!

Sciurus:
I just...

Sciurus:
I just wanted to help you...

Ratatos:
......

Sciurus:
You... You look tired, Ratatos. Are you okay?

Ratatos:
And if I say I'm not?

Sciurus:
......

Sciurus:
Fine, I get it! This whole thing needs to end somehow, right?

Sciurus:
I was the one who started all this. So I'll be the one to end it! And I still don't know how Yucatan and... and my subordinate are doing. I can't just sit here and wait any longer!

Ratatos:
Wait! Where are you going?!

Sciurus:
I'll find that prick Enciodes! I'll tell everyone that it was all a personal grudge between me and him, and none of this has anything to do with the Browntails!

Sciurus:
He can take my life if he wants, but he has to hand my people back!

Ratatos:
......

Sis, Sis! Why did Grandpa yell at you again? You've done so well!

Is it because you're going to lead the family? Is that why he keeps yelling at you?

I-In that case, I'll be the clan leader! I'll go to Grandpa and ask him to stop yelling at you all the time. I'll lead the family, so he can yell at me all he wants!

Hehe, it's okay. You don't need to worry about me, Sis. I've got Yucatan there for me. We promised each other we'll always play with each other! He'll help me. He's really good at studying too!

Also...

You never cry when you get yelled at, Sis.

Even though you never cry, I don't know why, it really makes my heart ache...

Ratatos:
Ha, haha...

Sciurus:
What's with you?! You stinking bitch! You can laugh at me, even at a time like this?!

Ratatos:
Hahaha... *Sigh*... Haha...

Ratatos:
(Rus... my silly sister...)

Sciurus:
You're probably cursing at me in your head again, aren't you?

Ratatos:
Something like that.

Sciurus:
Grrr!

Ratatos:
*Sigh*, come back. Don't go looking for Enciodes. You should stay out of this... Things aren't as simple as you think.

Ratatos:
Sciurus, do you remember we last had a nice chat together?

Sciurus:
I don't remember the two of us having a nice chat ever.

Ratatos:
I guess not...

Ratatos:
Alright, I need to think about what to do from here on out. You should go back to whatever it is you do.

Ratatos:
Oh, and be careful on your way home. Don't get caught.

Sciurus:
What do you mean? You aren't heading back to our land?

Ratatos:
Arctosz most likely hasn't gotten back to his estate yet.

Ratatos:
Once he's settled down some, he'll probably go out and pick a fight with Enciodes.

Ratatos:
I've got to do something before that happens.

Sciurus:
Don't you do anything stupid. Don't forget. Enciodes got Yucatan and Monch!

Sciurus:
And you... If anything happens to you, I'm gonna be running the show back home! D-Don't you forget that!

Ratatos:
......

Ratatos:
Sciurus could end up running the show back home, huh...?

Ratatos:
That might not be so bad...

Paleroche Commoner A:
Look, it's Sir Arctosz's team...

Paleroche Commoner B:
I heard he poisoned the Great Elder during the ceremony...

Gulo:
Shut up, all of you! Think about it. Would he possibly do anything as underhanded as poisoning someone?

Paleroche Commoner A:
Well... no... but...

Gulo:
You're a Paleroche, and you don't trust him?!

Paleroche Commoner A:
Eeeek!!

Arctosz:
Enough, Gulo.

Arctosz:
Taking it out on the common folk. Have you no shame?

Gulo:
But, Sir...!

Arctosz:
It doesn't matter if we were framed by Enciodes. What's done is done. Saying anything isn't going to help our case.

Gulo:
But do we really have to swallow our pride and take it?

Arctosz:
Swallow our pride? Of course not!

Arctosz:
I'll hand it to him. He's good, but do you know what's the biggest mistake he made?

Arctosz:
He didn't kill me at the ceremony.

Arctosz:
As soon as we get back to the estate and have our forces gathered, we'll head back to finish the fight with him.

Arctosz:
We'll show Enciodes just what a big mistake he made.

Gulo:
Very well! I should've expected no less from you, sir!

Valais:
I won't give you this chance.

Gulo:
Valais?!

Gulo:
Those men behind you... Are you betraying the Paleroches?!

Arctosz:
Valais... The house of Paleroche has treated you well. Why are you doing this?

Valais:
You've treated me well...?

Valais:
You still don't remember even now, do you?

Arctosz:
Remember what? I, Arctosz, am an honorable man. When have I everâ€”

Valais:
This is, um?

Arctosz:
Don't be afraid, Valais.

Arctosz:
Your father will get much better once he takes the Great Elder's elixir and has the evil in him expelled.

Arctosz:
He was injured during the Holy Hunt to protect us.

Arctosz:
The Great Elder figured he was probably attacked by the TschÃ¤ggÃ¤ttÃ¤ when he was all alone...

Arctosz:
He's too weak now... Come, I'll give him the medicine.

Valais:
Why isn't my father awake yet? And what is this green stuff on his lips...?

Great Elder:
The evil has spread too deep. Kjeragandr no longer allows his presence here.

Great Elder:
He argued with the Vine-Bear Court several times before. He must have been under the TschÃ¤ggÃ¤ttÃ¤'s influence, and it culminated in the TschÃ¤ggÃ¤ttÃ¤ coming to take him back today.

Great Elder:
If the elixir couldn't regain his strength and faith, then this must be Her will.

Arctosz:
......

Arctosz:
The wine the Great Elder drank. It can't be!

Valais:
Yes.

Valais:
Do you remember the bottle of elixir that the Great Elder brought with him when he visited my father? How it was nowhere to be found?

Valais:
I'm sorry, my master. I had my doubts, and I didn't fully believe it either... until the moment the Great Elder collapsed during the ceremony.

Valais:
......

Arctosz:
I... I sent my own officer to... with my own hands...

Valais:
I don't blame you. It wasn't your fault.

Valais:
But perhaps it's high time that Kjerag saw change for the better. I hope you won't stand in my way.

Valais:
Please think of it as a way to avoid having even more loyal Kjerag warriors end the way he did...

Sharp:
Keep Arctosz from running into any trouble on his way, huh...? Looks like the Doctor got it right again.

Sharp:
Butâ€“â€“

Sharp:
I really should've brought Blaze with me. Out of all the elite operators who take the enemy head on, she's the only one who's got the mobility to traverse the mountainous terrain here.

Sharp:
With the trains stopped, Kjerag's transportation network might as well be nonexistent...

Sharp:
Oh, whatever. Let's get going.

Gnosis:
......

Boy Enciodes:
Do you have to go?

Boy Gnosis:
Yeah, my parents have already decided. There's no room for us in Kjerag anymore.

Boy Enciodes:
I still don't believe it was your parents who did it, and it's definitely got nothing to do with you.

Boy Gnosis:
I believe it, though.

Boy Enciodes:
What do you mean?

Boy Gnosis:
I don't know if my parents really did it, and I also don't know... if I was an accomplice somehow.

Boy Enciodes:
Even if you were, I'd forgive you.

Boy Enciodes:
No one looks up to my father more than you. I know that.

Boy Gnosis:
Enciodes, remember our dream?

Boy Enciodes:
Of course I remember.

Boy Enciodes:
The two of us will turn Kjerag into the most powerful country in the world.

Boy Enciodes:
But you're leaving...

Boy Gnosis:
I'll be back.

Boy Enciodes:
Really?

Boy Gnosis:
Yeah. My parents are thinking of moving to Victoria, and I'll go to school there.

Boy Gnosis:
This is a good opportunity. I'll study all the advanced stuff there, and once I am done, I'll come back and help you.

Boy Enciodes:
Heh... You jerk.

Boy Enciodes:
In that case, I'll let you in on this idea that I have. I haven't told anyone about this yet.

Boy Gnosis:
What is it?

Boy Enciodes:
I'm going to leave Kjerag once both Enya and Ensia have grown up.

Boy Enciodes:
Like you, I'll study lots of things and come back.

Boy Gnosis:
You're the future clan leader... Can you really leave Kjerag that long?

Boy Enciodes:
I'll come find you when that happens.

Kjerag Warrior A:
Hey, Gnosis. Here's your food.

Gnosis:
......

Kjerag Warrior A:
Tsk, don't think you're getting out of this mess just because you're keeping quiet.

Kjerag Warrior A:
Let me tell you. Every last person in the Silverash clan wants to skin you alive right now.

Kjerag Warrior A:
How dare you do what you did to Sir Enciodes and the Saintess? If it wasn't for his orders to keep you locked up here, I wouldn't give you even a sip of water, let alone food.

Gnosis:
......

Kjerag Warrior A:
Not going to eat, drink, or even make a peep, huh?

Kjerag Warrior A:
Alright, then. You can rot here and die for all I care!

Gnosis:
......

Young Enciodes:
Gnosis, you've changed quite a lot.

Young Enciodes:
You never used to sneer at people, much less belittle them as worthless.

Young Gnosis:
I could tell you the same.

Young Gnosis:
You would never use your status as a weapon, and you never thought much of social pleasantries.

Young Enciodes:
It was something I had to learn to deal with the nobles.

Young Gnosis:
And I couldn't care less how others see me if it means I can better focus on my research.

Young Enciodes:
What kind of research are you working on?

Young Gnosis:
Life science as well as Originium analysis.

Young Enciodes:
Sounds complicated.

Young Gnosis:
What about you? Surely you must already have a certain standing among the nobles here.

Young Enciodes:
Do you remember what we said to each other when you left Kjerag?

Young Gnosis:
......

Young Enciodes:
I'm very glad that I left Kjerag, Gnosis.

Young Enciodes:
It wasn't until I came to the outside world that I realized we no longer live in times where isolation is enough to keep ourselves out of the affairs around us.

Young Enciodes:
In the past hundred years, there have been countless exchanges and conflicts between nations. Columbia rose quickly in a conflict, while Gaul, a powerful country, was also wiped out in a conflict.

Young Enciodes:
All the world's nations are slowly changing in these times separated by Catastrophes. Refusing relations with others is no longer an option.

Young Enciodes:
If Kjerag remains as it is, keeping its borders closed under the assumption that will earn us a life of peace and tranquility.

Young Enciodes:
Then only destruction awaits us.

Young Enciodes:
We've reached the end of this peace and tranquility. We can't wait for anyone to throw open these gates for us. Kjerag must make contact with the outside world. We must take that step forward while we still have control.

Young Enciodes:
Come help me, Gnosis.

Young Gnosis:
Hmph...

Kjerag Warrior A:
*Sigh*, this sucks balls.

Kjerag Warrior B:
Stop complaining. You're starting to make me feel that way too.

Kjerag Warrior A:
I really don't get it. Why is Sir Enciodes only locking up Gnosis?

Kjerag Warrior A:
If I were him, I'd separate the traitor's head from his neck straight away.

Kjerag Warrior B:
What do you know? How is beheading him going to calm Sir Enciodes's anger?

Kjerag Warrior B:
He treated Gnosis so well, only to be betrayed.

Kjerag Warrior B:
If I were him, I'd torture this guy some.

Kjerag Warrior A:
You have a point, but aren't we about to go to war with the other two clans? I want to be on the front lines.

Kjerag Warrior B:
Look at you, all bloodthirsty.

Kjerag Warriors A & B:
Master.

Enciodes:
How is Gnosis doing?

Kjerag Warrior A:
He's fasted for a full day, sir.

Kjerag Warrior B:
He hasn't said a word since we put him in there. Didn't even respond when we shouted at him.

Enciodes:
Let me talk to him.

Kjerag Warrior A:
Of course.

Kjerag Warrior A:
Hey, what do you think Sir Enciodes is going to talk about?

Kjerag Warrior B:
How would I know?

Kjerag Warrior A:
Didn't Gnosis used to be a trusted confidant? I'm betting Sir Enciodes is going to poison him. Give him a honorable death.

Kjerag Warrior B:
You've been reading too many novels.

Kjerag Warrior B:
That said...

Enciodes:
It seems Ratatos is seeking the Great Elder's help.

Gnosis:
Both you and I knew this would happen sooner or later.

Gnosis:
They can't possibly believe everything you have done is in the name of Kjerag.

Gnosis:
Most of the company's employees know that it is Karlan Trade they're working for, not Kjerag.

Enciodes:
A war is not something you start when you have a choice. I hope you can understand my hand was forced.

Gnosis:
Perhaps you're worrying too much.

Gnosis:
Bring down the other two families and rebuild. It's much easier than the 'honorable' solution you're pursuing.

Enciodes:
Kjerag would never truly accept me if I seized power by force.

Gnosis:
In that case, let me do it.

Gnosis:
I have far less worries than you do.

Enciodes:
Let you do... what?

Gnosis:
You can drop the act, Enciodes.

Gnosis:
This idea has crossed your mind. We both know that.

Gnosis:
Let me, the son of a sinner, the villain of Karlan Trade, be a traitor again. There is no one more suitable for the job.

Enciodes:
......

Gnosis:
I'm not your pawn, Enciodes, and I most definitely am not your underling.

Gnosis:
I'm your partner-in-crime.

Gnosis:
Even if you don't agree to it, I'll still do this.

Gnosis:
Actually, it'll be for the better if you don't. Our charade will be that much more realistic.

Gnosis:
Kjerag has no room for me. Truth be told, I couldn't care less whether it had any room for me.

Gnosis:
It'll just be another item on my list of charges. I don't care.

Enciodes:
......

Gnosis:
......

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
What's on your mind?

Gnosis:
I'm thinking that you actually haven't changed much over the last twenty years.

Enciodes:
And why is that?

Gnosis:
You're a conceited perfectionist.

Gnosis:
You always want the perfect result, and you always think that you can get it.

Enciodes:
The perfect result would be if Arctosz and Ratatos had not been in our way.

Enciodes:
The Great Elder would also have accepted the change that Kjerag is about to go through, and everything would naturally have unfolded the way we wanted.

Gnosis:
That isn't the perfect result. You know that. At most, it's the perfect dream.

Gnosis:
They can't see what you and I can see. In that case, you should never have expected them to share the same ideas as us.

Enciodes:
But you and I think drastically differently as well.

Gnosis:
I told you, Enciodes. I'm not your pawn, and I'm not your underling.

Gnosis:
I have my own judgment, and our judgments share many overlapping points.

Gnosis:
Or would you like to finish me, the traitor, and make this farce real?

Enciodes:
......

Under the dim light, Enciodes reaches his hand out to Gnosis.

Enciodes:
I'm just glad that you are my dearest friend.

Gnosis:
......

Gnosis keeps silent for a moment. Then, he reaches out to shake Enciodes's hand.

Gnosis:
I told you. It'll just be another item on my list of charges. I'm more than used to that.

Nothing has changed from all those years ago.

Enciodes:
Arctosz is amassing his forces.

Gnosis:
What about Ratatos?

Enciodes:
Take a look at this.

Gnosis:
An obvious trap...

Enciodes:
It's worth going, nonetheless.

Gnosis:
The situation is not so optimistic that you can take meaningless risks.

Enciodes:
We've won, Gnosis.

Enciodes:
We've achieved our original goal. Now, the Paleroches and the Browntails are traitors to Kjerag.

Enciodes:
My spies inside the Browntail family will help us with the public opinion. As for the Paleroches, they may be stubborn, but they are all upstanding people.

Enciodes:
Once they wrap their minds around the gravity of Arctosz's crime, much of the Paleroches' doors will open to us.

Enciodes:
We have ample time to sort out what comes next.

Gnosis:
Arctosz and Ratatos will not give up so easily.

Enciodes:
That is exactly why I will meet her.

Enciodes:
If Ratatos had come with me to Victoria to study all those years ago, she would not be so much weaker than I am.

Enciodes:
And now she has put her chips on the table, just like that. It would be untactful of me to not call this bet.

Gnosis:
You will one day die of your arrogance, Enciodes.

Enciodes:
Then so be it, but that won't happen today or during this outing.

Enciodes:
As for Arctosz, he's not entirely without surprises, and that is why I am having you step up now.

Gnosis:
What can a hot-headed moron like him accomplish?

Enciodes:
Arctosz himself can't, though Dr. {@nickname} certainly surprised me.

Enciodes:
That is the greatest variable in this game of ours, and it's one that I have to watch out for.

Gnosis:
Dr. {@nickname}.

Gnosis:
I agree that one has done many things beyond my expectation since arriving in Kjerag, but is this Doctor really worthy of your concern?

Enciodes:
One who knows almost nothing about Kjerag has stepped into one of the stage's most vital roles within such a short period of time, greatly disrupting our plans.

Enciodes:
I can honestly say that if I were in that position, I would not have been able to do it.

Enciodes:
And I also cannot begin to imagine what the Doctor is planning to do next. Perhaps the Doctor won't do a thing, or perhapsâ€”

Enciodes:
The Doctor can do something that I couldn't begin to imagine.

Gnosis:
Hmph, this isn't my first time telling you thisâ€”If you're afraid to lose, you better not act like you're enjoying the challenge.

Gnosis:
You've fooled many, but you cannot fool me. You cannot fool the bodyguard you hired from Kazimierz either.

Enciodes:
Likewise, this isn't my first time to offer you this rebuttal. Taking delight in a gamble and not wanting to lose are not mutually exclusive.

Enciodes:
Much of the joy one derives from a gamble comes not from the result. Rather, it comes from the whole march towards victory.

Gnosis:
Fine, say no more. This is always the hardest part for us to reach a consensus. I only wish that I still have a chance to save you before your arrogance ends up killing you.

Enciodes:
We will have many opportunities to debate this later. In any case, I will leave you in charge while I meet with Ratatos.

Gnosis:
Is there anyone left in Karlan Trade who would listen to me?

Enciodes:
Weiss, Matterhorn.

Enciodes:
The two of them will pass on any of your orders.

Matterhorn:
Gnosis, Sir Enciodes has told us everything. We owe you much.

Weiss:
I never thought it could all be a ruse...

Gnosis:
Let's save the pleasantries.

Gnosis:
Tsk, and here I thought I could finally get some quiet time.

Gnosis:
My research has been halted for far too long already. At least I could read some books if you'd kept me locked in here.

Enciodes:
You're my partner-in-crime, and this undertaking is ours together. You will have more than enough time to do your research in the future.

Gnosis:
That's only if you make it back here alive...

Degenbrecher:
It's time to go, Enciodes.

Enciodes:
I'm leaving everything in your hands, Gnosis.

Degenbrecher:
......

Gnosis:
......

Degenbrecher:
I'm curious. Back at the ceremony, were you going at it for real?

Gnosis:
What if I was?

Degenbrecher:
Then perhaps you need to spend some time to work on your skills.

Degenbrecher:
You looked worse than before.

Gnosis:
I needn't you worry.

Degenbrecher:
My impression is that you could make half an enemy of mine. I have to worry, lest life get a bit too boring.

Gnosis:
Caster is only a side job to me.

Degenbrecher:
Your acting could be that much better too, if you were a little stronger.

Gnosis:
......

Degenbrecher:
That said, I've never seen you even a little excited.

Degenbrecher:
Convincing performance.

Degenbrecher:
Not that you're acting.

Gnosis:
......

Weiss:
Gnosis, what should we...?

Gnosis:
Where's Monch?

Weiss:
Monch is being held in another room. I can take you there.

Gnosis:
Does she know?

Weiss:
Sir Enciodes said it'd be best for you to tell her yourself.

Gnosis:
Lead the way.

Monch:
......

Monch:
Sir Gnosis...

Monch takes out a dagger from her boot. It is her most prized weapon.

It is a gift that Gnosis made for her between his experiments.

She lightly strokes the dagger, her eyes clouded with doubt and uncertainty.

Gnosis:
Don't do anything stupid, Monch.

Monch:
......

Monch:
It looks like you're well...

Monch:
Thank goodness.

Gnosis:
I'm fine.

Gnosis:
You've done a great job.

Monch:
I... I promised you.

Monch:
Whatever your orders, your wish is my command...

Monch:
......

Gnosis:
Judging by your look, I assume you've figured it all out.

Gnosis:
Right, Enciodes and I had all of this planned in advance.

Monch:
......

Monch:
I see, so that's really how it is...

Monch:
The Silverashes' Weiss was waiting below the cliff to rescue me, and I've been wondering ever since.

Monch:
If this was all a charade planned in advance, then what role do I play in it?

Monch:
And now that I find you here, I'm finally sure...

Gnosis:
......

Gnosis:
My apologies.

Monch:
You needn't ever apologize to me...

Gnosis:
Monch, you stand firm in your beliefs. I understand, but I will judge for myself what I say.

Monch:
......

Gnosis:
Enciodes and I had a rift, leading me to leave Karlan Trade and make contact with Ratatos. That was our plan all along.

Gnosis:
And the fewer people who knew of this plan, the better. That's why I never told you.

Monch:
......

Gnosis:
Both of us knew the risks.

Gnosis:
I had to make sure even the finest details were under our control. Everything had to be absolutely perfect. This isn't one of my usual maneuvers... There is no do-over.

Gnosis:
If that displeases you in any way, I must apologize.

Monch:
......

Monch:
No... T-That's not it...

Monch:
......

Monch:
Why...

Gnosis:
What?

Monch:
It doesn't matter what it is you want to do or what plans you have. I...

Monch:
...I will always support you.

Gnosis:
......

Monch:
Why didn't you believe me?

Monch:
You could've trusted me.

Gnosis:
......

Gnosis:
Monch, I hope you can understand.

Gnosis:
It's because I fully trust you that I handed you such an important task under those circumstances.

Gnosis:
I trust you, my finest subordinate, to perfectly execute my plans.

Monch:
......

Gnosis:
Don't overthink it. You've done very well, and everything is over now. Try to relax a little.

Gnosis:
You should take the time to rest.

Monch:
......

Gnosis:
Looks like you're not in the mood to talk...

Gnosis:
I'll come see you again.

Monch:
......

Monch:
Trust me...?

Monch:
Who trusts me? And where are they...?

Monch:
......

Monch:
Sir Gnosis... Can I still trust you?
