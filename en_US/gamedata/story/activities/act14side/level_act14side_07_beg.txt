Elder A:
Sigh!

Elder B:
What's the matter?

Elder A:
The 'Tschäggättäs' aren't letting us leave.

Elder A:
They said Enciodes instructed them to make sure we stay here, supposedly for our own safety.

Elder B:
See? This is exactly as I said. He is trying to lock us in here!

Elder A:
The Great Elder is unconscious, the Saintess is yet to be coronated, and he insists the other two clans are traitors. The way I see it, he is definitely up to no good.

Elder B:
Shh... *Sigh*... Talking about this is not going to do us any good. The Great Elder has always been in charge of the Court's affairs, and now that this has come to pass... What are we supposed to do?

Elder C:
Is this all Kjeragandr's will...?

Enya:
It's difficult to say whether this is what Kjeragandr wanted, but I'm sure it will pain Her heart to see you so dejected.

Elder A:
G-Great Saintess!

Elder B:
We... We are simply worried...

Enya:
Is there something to worry about?

Elder C:
The Great Elder's condition... and the situation surrounding the clans...

Enya:
I just talked to the doctor. The Great Elder's outlook is not optimistic, but I'm sure Kjeragandr will have mercy on him given his leadership of the Vine-Bear Court for so many years. Have faith, the Great Elder will get better.

Enya:
In the interim, I will take charge of all of the Court's decisions, big and small.

Elder A:
Well...

Kjarr:
The Saintess was supposed take charge of Kjerag at the coronation, and the Great Elder has wanted to pass the baton to the Saintess for some time now. Given the extraordinary circumstances, what's stopping you?

Kjarr:
Or do you elders have a better idea?

Elder A:
You're just the head maid...

Elder B:
Enough. Head Maid Kjarr has the right of it.

Elder B:
We've always had faith in the Saintess's ability, and she is willing to step forward to calm the masses. There is no better arrangement.

Enya:
You needn't worry, dear elders.

Enya:
Considering what had happened at the ceremony, Enciodes indeed had a reason to do as he did.

Enya:
And even if Enciodes harbored ill intentions, as long as I'm here, the Vine-Bear Court will be safe.

Before, the Saintess's presence on the Holy Hunt's grounds, although brilliant, was only eye-catching.

But now, the Saintess radiates a certain aura that makes her impossible to defy.

The elders look at each other, before lowering their heads to her.

'As you wish, Saintess.'

Enya:
Leave us, please.

Enya:
......

Enya:
Phew...

Kjarr:
Enya, you were incredible.

Enya:
Really?

Kjarr:
Really. I thought you'd be disappointed after you came back from the ceremony.

Kjarr:
Looks like I was worrying too much.

Enya:
I'm disappointed alright.

Enya:
But the last time I was disappointed, I couldn't say anything.

Enya:
Back then, I had no way to fight for myself.

Enya:
This time, even though I'm disappointed, I know that I have the power to make a change, no matter how little.

Enya:
So I don't want to be left disappointed this time. I need to do something to stave off my disappointment.

Kjarr:
Enya... You've grown up.

Enya:
I wish I could've stayed a child forever. Thinking about these things all day is just too much effort...

Enya:
......

Enya:
But you're right. I've grown up.

Great Elder:
Faith...

Great Elder:
*Cough*...

Devotee:
Great Elder, you're awake!

Great Elder:
Quiet down.

Devotee:
Quieting.

Great Elder:
The ceremony... *cough*... What became of it? I... I remember interrogating the Browntail subject, but no more...

Devotee:
You were poisoned by Sir Arctosz. Then, Gnosis's appearance made things all the more complicated.

Devotee:
In the end, Sir Arctosz and Matriarch Ratatos joined hands to take on Sir Enciodes, only for him to overwhelm them...

Great Elder:
That's not what I wanted to hear.

Great Elder:
What about the coronation ceremony? The Saintess? The transfer of powers?

Devotee:
The ceremony was cancelled... Sir Enciodes announced that it will resume once the Paleroches and the Browntails are dealt with.

Great Elder:
......

Great Elder:
Enciodes... *cough*...

Great Elder:
Where's the Saintess?

Devotee:
She... She is in her room right now.

Great Elder:
......

Little one, how does it feel to sit in a Tri-Clan Council meeting for the first time?

Great Elder... I never imagined that... the Tri-Clan Council's meetings would be so boring.

The clan leaders only talked about things that concerned their families. Every time they talk about which family will put in more effort in the annual events, they aren't interested at all. They don't care about Kjeragandr.

Hohoh, a smart one. I was right about you.

Great Elder... Did you show me this on purpose?

That's right.

Why?

Because you will one day become the Great Elder.

Then, you'll understand just what this so-called faith stands for.

Great Elder:
You... How long has it been since you came to the Vine-Bear Court?

Devotee:
Huh? 25 years, Great Elder.

Great Elder:
In those 25 years... *cough*... how do you think the Vine-Bear Court and Kjerag have changed?

Devotee:
I... Aside from all that the Silverashes brought us, I do not think there has been any significant change.

Great Elder:
These lands have not changed for a millennium.

Great Elder:
The future ought to see no change either.

Great Elder:
*Cough*... Help me up.

Devotee:
But, Great Elder, your health...

Great Elder:
I know my health... *cough*... better than anybody else.

Great Elder:
I don't have much time left.

Devotee:
But...

Great Elder:
Have the Saintess proceed to the great hall. Tell her... I must speak to her about something.

Arctosz:
Doctor, this is the second time you've saved my rear.

Arctosz:
I've had a problem with Enciodes ever since he came back to Kjerag and established that Karlan Trade of his.

Arctosz:
I'm sure you saw it yourself when you entered Kjerag, his trade port. I can't begin to make heads or tails of it.

Arctosz:
I've used the things he brought in. They're handy. My men are using them too. I know that.

Arctosz:
The youths working for me think I don't know what they say about him. Well, I do.

Arctosz:
But he can't keep things going like this. He's going to drive Kjerag further and further into this fire pit.

Arctosz:
Kjeragandr is watching from above. If we go down that path, Kjerag will be punished.

Arctosz:
That's why I've always been the first one to stand up against him, and this is what that got me.

Arctosz:
The Paleroches are no fans of trickery.

Arctosz:
And I had Valais by my side, but now...

Arctosz:
Can I trust you?

Sharp:
Doctor, Ratatos is here.

Ratatos:
Arctosz? I thought a hotheaded punk like you would've led your forces to take on Enciodes right about now.

Arctosz:
If it wasn't for the Doctor stopping me, that's what I would be doing right now.

Ratatos:
You're... the Doctor... from Rhodes Island...

Ratatos:
You saved my life. Normally, I should be rewarding you somehow.

Ratatos:
But if what you want is the house of Browntail, then I'm sorry to disappoint you.

Ratatos:
Well, that's about the most pleasing thing I've heard the past couple days.

Ratatos:
You...

Ratatos:
You and I have never met, and yet you did all that to stoke the fire. Tell me, how am I supposed to not overthink it?

Ratatos:
Well, whatever.

Ratatos:
If Arctosz's here, I don't even have to guess at what it is that you want.

Ratatos:
I'll be honest with you. Before your guy here found me, I was seriously thinking about surrendering to Enciodes.

Ratatos:
Are you sure I can help you?

Arctosz:
The Paleroches will never surrender.

Ratatos:
So...? What do you people want?

Ratatos:
You don't have to spell it out to me like that.

Ratatos:
The people are on Enciodes's side. When the ceremony ended, he even proclaimed that the 'crimes' are mine and Arctosz's alone and didn't do a thing to our territory.

Ratatos:
He's decided Kjerag is already his.

Ratatos:
And that's actually how things are.

Arctosz:
Doctor, you're a smart one. What else can we do?

Ratatos:
You're right that only the Saintess can set things right.

Ratatos:
And Enciodes's taken control of the Vine-Bear Court so that the Saintess can't say anything.

Ratatos:
Now here's the problem—He definitely sees you coming.

Ratatos:
Actually, he probably has all those men guarding the place so that you can walk right into the trap.

Matterhorn:
They'll help the Saintess?

Gnosis:
There's a reason that Enciodes isn't mounting an attack on the other enemies.

Gnosis:
First, he doesn't think it's necessary.

Gnosis:
Second, he is worried that the Doctor will help the Paleroches.

Weiss:
The Doctor... If the Doctor's actually helping Arctosz, things are probably going to get out of hand.

Gnosis:
This Doctor isn't taking charge of Arctosz's army to fight us, though.

Gnosis:
From what you have told me, this Doctor wants to stop Arctosz from being the reckless man he is and launching an all-out war. Considering that, it's not likely there will be any direct confrontation that leads to bloodshed.

Gnosis:
I don't exactly believe in this possibility, however. The way I see it, it's not out of the question that this Doctor is trying to take control of the Paleroches and the Browntails, seeking to become Kjerag's new overlord.

Matterhorn:
The Doctor's not that kind of person.

Weiss:
Right. The Doctor certainly could do it, though.

Gnosis:
I must say I'm a little flabbergasted by the appraisal that you two and Enciodes have of this person.

Gnosis:
I can only hope you are right in that judgment.

Gnosis:
In any case, however things end up, it's very likely that they are aiming for Mount Karlan, which is under our control, of course.

Gnosis:
They'll need the Saintess to turn the tide of public opinion.

Gnosis:
And if they succeed in getting the Saintess out of Mount Karlan, then all that Enciodes has done will be for naught.

Gnosis:
Naturally, the Doctor knows that.

Gnosis:
That's why we will see this Doctor here.

Matterhorn:
It's ironic. In their eyes, we Silverashes are taking our own family heiress hostage.

Gnosis:
They aren't wrong. Enya Silverash is indeed our hostage right now.

Matterhorn:
......

Gnosis:
If you would rather I use a different turn of phrase, the Saintess has become our most important bargaining chip.

Gnosis:
That doesn't change anything, however.

Weiss:
Gnosis... could you please stop provoking Matterhorn?

Gnosis:
I'm helping you two face reality.

Gnosis:
Or are you trying to tell me that you two didn't know that Enciodes had his eyes on more than just the transfer of powers?

Gnosis:
It was never his plan to let faith govern the state.

Matterhorn:
......

Gnosis:
That's not to say anything negative about Enya Silverash.

Gnosis:
I'm not interested in her at all. Naturally, I don't have any opinion about her.

Gnosis:
But she became the Saintess, and she's done very well.

Gnosis:
In that case, she will no doubt be an obstacle to Enciodes. That's all. And now things have come to this, we cannot permit anyone else on this stage to do any better than the head of the Silverash family.

Matterhorn:
I know that...

Matterhorn:
Of course I know that.

Gnosis:
This isn't a game. There are no do-overs. Let's not give ourselves any unnecessary trouble.

Gnosis:
Monch, you're in charge of surveillance.

Monch:
On it.

Arctosz:
Good. This plan is perfect!

Ratatos:
You sure about that...?

Ratatos:
......

Ratatos:
On the surface, we're sending our forces to raze the place to the ground, making it look like we're there to save Yucatan and attract their attention that way, to confuse them about your real plans.

Ratatos:
You want the main force to attack them from the front.

Ratatos:
That's to let Arctosz's forces get near Mount Karlan. Your guys will also be there in the mountains to help them along.

Ratatos:
Doesn't sound like the safest plan there is, but it seems feasible.

Ratatos:
What about Degenbrecher? Even if you can deal with Enciodes's Tschäggättä performers, if you don't have a way to take care of that actual monster, you'll never be able to get to him.

Sharp:
Is this part of my job too?

Ratatos:
You make that sound simple, but are you sure about this?

Sharp:
I wouldn't say sure. But I can probably keep her busy for some ten minutes.

Ratatos:
You're a monster yourself, huh...?

Ratatos:
So, Doctor of Rhodes Island. How are you so sure I'll help you?

Ratatos:
You know, you kind of remind me of Enciodes.

Ratatos:
You told me all about your plan, and then you say don't absolutely need me.

Ratatos:
But I already know every last detail.

Ratatos:
No one would let somebody who knows so much just walk away.

Ratatos:
......

Ratatos:
Whatever...

Sciurus:
I'll go in your place.

Ratatos:
Sciurus, this isn't a game.

Sciurus:
Why don't you take a look in the mirror before you say that crap, Ratatos?

Sciurus:
You're exhausted, you look pale as a ghost. Hell, you look completely out of it.

Sciurus:
How am I supposed to relax when I have someone like you there to save my husband?

Ratatos:
......

Sciurus:
I don't know what you and Enciodes talked about in that room.

Sciurus:
But I'm not going to watch you hand the Browntail family over to him!

Ratatos:
......

Sciurus:
Why are you staring at me like that? You want a fight?

Ratatos:
You might just be right.

Ratatos:
......

Ratatos:
Fine, Doctor of Rhodes Island. Sciurus will help you with your plan in my place.

Ratatos:
Though, to tell you the truth, I'm not holding out hope that we can get anything back from Enciodes.

Ratatos:
All I can say is: good luck.
