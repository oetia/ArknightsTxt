Business-Tripping Manager:
Sir, this is just a shoddy plank of wood. What makes it sell for fifty whole pounds?

Kjerag Merchant:
Now, sir, you'll want to learn something new today. This is no ordinary piece of wood. It's a blessing of Kjeragandr, Goddess of the Snow Realm.

Kjerag Merchant:
It's all thanks to Her protection that Kjerag could be free from the Catastrophes and set down roots here.

Kjerag Merchant:
And the stuff that made this charm comes from the evergreen trees of Mount Jungfrau, our own second-highest peak in all of Kjerag.

Kjerag Merchant:
Do you know much about Jungfrau? Legends say, it's a mountain formed from the tears of Kjeragandr as they fell and froze.

Kjerag Merchant:
The trees watered in that snow from on high grow full with Kjeragandr's love and favor for this land, and charms made from that timber assure your safety and warding of calamity where you may go.

Kjerag Merchant:
Seeing as it's your first time here in Kjerag, why not take some souvenirs for your homefolk back in Victoria?

Business-Tripping Manager:
What gives you that idea?

Kjerag Merchant:
Listen, these last two years, Mr. Enciodes has had more and more of these big corporate whosits flocking in. I heard your accent and I knew straight away.

Kjerag Merchant:
To new people like you, see, I recommend these charms in particular to mark the occasion.

Kjerag Merchant:
Heard of the Tschäggättä, maybe? They're people-eating beasts deep in our mountains. Sinister to the eye, inhuman, there and gone again when you least expect.

Kjerag Merchant:
But so long as you're wearing this charm, blessed by the Vine-Bear Court, you'll cower those things under Kjeragandr's might, and they won't harm you.

Kjerag Merchant:
And just think, you take it back to your family and tell them, this charm bears the divine protection of Kjerag's Mount Karlan. Paints the complete picture, doesn't it?

Kjerag Merchant:
You've tripped halfway across the land to Kjerag. You wouldn't go back to your own without something nice for it, would you?

Business-Tripping Manager:
......

Business-Tripping Manager:
...Bah, fine. I'll take one, and one for my wife and little tot each!

Kjerag Merchant:
That's the ticket! If only we could all be straightforward as you!

???:
Let me see—sorry, this wood must've been stripped from any random mountain tree.

Kjerag Merchant:
?!

Kjerag Merchant:
Wh—What gives you the right to say that?!

Ensia:
First, without approval from the Paleroches, no one's even allowed to climb Jungfrau.

Ensia:
Second, I sure didn't hear about anyone climbing her while I was gone.

Ensia:
When I left Kjerag, I even told Weiss, if anyone makes it up her, be sure to send me a message.

Kjerag Merchant:
How do you know who...

Kjerag Merchant:
Wait a minute, that tail... you can't be Miss Ensia?!

Business-Tripping Manager:
Ensia... y—you're Mr. Enciodes's sister?!

Ensia:
Uh-huh?

Business-Tripping Manager:
Now, hold it, sir, were you actually trying to swindle me?!

Kjerag Merchant:
Well, hahahah, they said Miss Ensia loved climbing ever since she was little. Seems she knows more about the snowcaps than us commoners after all.

Kjerag Merchant:
All these wares of mine came from the hunters in the mountains, actually. They must have been the ones swindling me, no doubt.

Kjerag Merchant:
I'll be going to find them and settle our score!

Kjerag Merchant:
As for this charm... Miss Ensia, would you mind?

Ensia:
It's true it has the Vine-Bear Court's blessing. No man of Kjerag would dare to forge that seal and offend Kjeragandr.

Ensia:
If you want to ward off any rumored Tschäggättäs with it, forget it. But if you take it back as a souvenir, I think it'll work great.

Ensia:
So, just slash that price a little.

Kjerag Merchant:
Huff... in light of that, I'll put them at ten pounds a piece! Now, sir, are you still buying?

Business-Tripping Manager:
If the sister of Mr. Enciodes says as much, I've got no reason to be skeptical.

Business-Tripping Manager:
Business for you must be tough. I'll take five of them!

Kjerag Merchant:
Coming right up.

Kjerag Merchant:
Are you here to buy anything, Miss Ensia? Whatever you fancy, it's yours. My business owes itself to the Silverashes, after all.

Ensia:
No, no, I'll pay you like normal.

Ensia:
Right, Doctor?

Ensia:
Jeez, we could exchange all we want, but it's still only worth anything in our family's region.

Ensia:
And this trade port's doing the hottest business anywhere in our land. You may as well spend all that money right here. You'll still get away with it.

Ensia:
Hey, c'mon, Doctor. Other people have to make a living too.

Ensia:
But if you really want, we can go see what my brother says about it. He'd get things sorted out sweet!

Weiss:
Lady Ensia, we should be on our way to the station by now.

Ensia:
Ooh, we're tight on time. Doctor, let's go.

???:
The blizzard is coming. Take caution, outsider.

???:
If you don't want to freeze, leaving now will still save your skin.

Ensia:
What are you blanking for, Doctor?

Ensia:
Huh? There's nobody here, though.

It's far from the right season for leisurely outdoor coffee.

You look behind you, and only see the bright canopy blocking the sun, and a sign advertising Karlan Trade.

A deserted terrace sits silent, just like the distant peaks of pure white.

Maybe it was the pages of the magazine on the table, rustling in the wind, that gave you the illusion someone was sitting next to you, talking to you.

Ensia:
Doctor, snap out of it. Let's move.

???:
We'll meet again.

Weiss:
Matterhorn! You're here. The Master's waiting for you.

Matterhorn:
Good to see you, Weiss.

Matterhorn:
Aren't you going?

Weiss:
I was going to, but the Master wants to invite the Doctor to the Tri-Clan Council with him, and have me stay back to greet them in your place. After all, I'm an employee of Rhodes Island myself.

Weiss:
I think you must be ready for a vacation after guarding the Young Lady for so long.

Weiss:
Besides, given you're out here, I'm guessing she ditched you?

Matterhorn:
Haha, yes. She's shopping with the Doctor right now.

Matterhorn:
She wanted a vacation for me too, so she had me let her free.

Weiss:
That's the Master and the Young Lady for you.

Weiss:
Well? How do you feel, being back this time?

Matterhorn:
The territory's been fast with construction, and huge in its overall change. It's almost unrecognizable already. That's the Master for you, indeed.

Matterhorn:
I'll take the two of them up on their great kindness and visit home for now, see my parents, and then I'll be on standby at the Master's.

Matterhorn:
How about you?

Weiss:
Me?

Matterhorn:
You've been away for a while too. Last time we met, weren't you off with the Master to Columbia?

Weiss:
I've got nothing pressing. Savoring the streets again is more than enough for me.

Matterhorn:
What about that old Itra friend of yours? Monch, I think, was the name. Eat a bite with him if you have the time.

Weiss:
That's...

Weiss:
...We'll see, I guess.

Sharp:
......

Sharp:
It's me.

Aurora:
Can you hear me?

Sharp:
I can hear you.

Aurora:
Brilliant! It looks like the base station's signal is fine.

Sharp:
Mm.

Sharp:
How are you?

Aurora:
I've found a few suitable hidden spots for the comms station installation. But no matter where we install a station in Turicum, we won't be able to catch all of Kjerag.

Aurora:
This is Kjerag's southern gateway, and practically its only contact channel with the outside.

Aurora:
Setting up a comms network here has massive importance, but if you want to cover the whole of Kjerag, setting up a few more simple stations around the central lake region would be the best option.

Sharp:
That's not what I'm asking.

Aurora:
...? Didn't you have me wandering outside so I could scope things for us?

Sharp:
What I mean is, you haven't been back in Kjerag for a long time. How do you feel?

Aurora:
Oh...

Aurora:
Honestly, it feels totally unbelievable. When I left Kjerag under the Silverashes' talent fostering program, it was from here too.

Aurora:
Back then, even Turicum was just an ordinary little village, let alone the rail station at the border now.

Aurora:
I never thought it'd become so big. At this point, I think you could argue it stands up to the cities on the outside.

Aurora:
Doing construction work like this in the snowy mountains must be harder than I could ever imagine.

Sharp:
Good.

Aurora:
Where are you all right now, Captain? I'll come find you.

Sharp:
We're boarding a train to Karlan.

Sharp:
You don't need to come with yet.

Aurora:
Huh?

Sharp:
You mentioned your home was in an industrial area, in the mountains.

Aurora:
Yep.

Sharp:
For now, go back and visit.

Sharp:
Nothing's more important than family.

Aurora:
But...

Sharp:
You're back in the mountains. It's the perfect opportunity to head for home. The Doctor thinks so, too.

Aurora:
Did the Doctor say that?

Aurora:
...I understand. If you're okay with it, then I will.

Aurora:
So, the Doctor...

Sharp:
The Doctor has me with.

Broadcast:
The train for the foot of Mt. Karlan is about to depart.

Broadcast:
The train will depart soon, please board now.

Sharp:
I'm heading out.

Sharp:
Have a good break, Aurora.

With a steam whistle and a faint announcement, the train departing for Karlan sets slowly into motion.

Ensia:
Doctor, let me tell you about the names of all these peaks.

Ensia:
Look. The one there with the flat-ish slope is Jungfrau. The third Saintess named that one.

Ensia:
The really steep one there, that's Matterhorn. His name actually came straight from that one.

......

Ensia continues on, with something to say about all the scenery that passes by, and all that Kjerag is.

Aside, Courier wears his eternal smile, listening to every word quietly and respectfully. But from time to time, the faraway look in his eyes carries a hint of something unclear.

Sharp reclines against the seat browsing net pages. He'll find that the contents of Kjerag's internet far exceed his expectations.

Alternately, you listen to Ensia, and cast your gaze out of the window.

Outside, remnants of ice drift in a lake reflecting the blue sky. Some locals are together at its shallows, some drawing water, some doing their laundry, some laughing.

The purest white snowpeaks stand imposingly tall, any attempt to lift your head and see their end blocked by the sunlight.

Halfway up, where the mountains level somewhat, a young shepherd herds flocks of stockbeasts home. No surprise crosses him as he sees the people aboard the train; instead, he lifts his whip, waving at you in greeting.

Not far away is the village where he lives, smoke spiraling from chimneys, peaceful and prosperous.

The sight of it all wipes the cares from your mind.

Perhaps, this journey will be just fine.
