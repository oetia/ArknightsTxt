Kjerag Civilian A:
What? Sir Enciodes was attacked in the mountains yesterday?!

Kjerag Civilian B:
Huh? Is that true?

Kjerag Warrior:
Of course it's true. Sir Arctosz had General Gulo rush people over to report to the Great Elder.

Kjerag Warrior:
The other nephew of my third uncle came back with General Gulo.

Kjerag Warrior:
They arrived just now, and I heard the news from him.

Kjerag Civilian A:
What a good lad. Now that's some big news!

Kjerag Warrior:
Heh!

Kjerag Civilian B:
But, who would be so foolhardy as to attack Sir Enciodes? On his way to the Holy Hunt, no less!

Kjerag Civilian A:
Do you think it could've been a Tschäggättä?

Kjerag Civilian C:
How the hell could've it been a Tschäggättä? Didn't we already say a person did it?

Kjerag Civilian C:
If you ask me, it must've been the doing of the Paleroches or the Browntails.

Kjerag Civilian C:
They tried so hard to suppress the Silverashes, saying something about how Sir Enciodes had trampled upon our teachings.

Kjerag Civilian C:
But who knows, maybe they were really after the Silverash clan's land.

Kjerag Warrior:
I wouldn't go around making spurious claims like that.

Kjerag Civilian C:
Spurious? Do you have any idea how much Silverash land the Browntail clan gobbled up after Sir Enciodes left Kjerag to study abroad?

Kjerag Civilian B:
......

Kjerag Civilian C:
Now that Sir Enciodes has had a change of heart and took the initiative to show favor to the Saintess, the other two clans are panicking because they no longer have an excuse to keep the Silverashes down.

Kjerag Civilian A:
Well...

Kjerag Warrior:
Wh-Who do you belong to?!

Kjerag Civilian C:
I'm with the Browntail clan. So what?

Kjerag Warrior:
You're a Browntail? How can you say those things about your own clan?!

Kjerag Civilian C:
Because I've been working down in the valley for so long, I honestly feel that Sir Enciodes has been wronged!

Kjerag Civilian C:
Sir Enciodes has brought so many good things to Kjerag, but has been kept down in the Tri-Clan Council.

Kjerag Civilian C:
Even now after he has offered to return to the government and taken the initiative to repair his relationship with the Vine-Bear Court and the Saintess, look how they treat him.

Kjerag Civilian C:
Even if you're a Paleroche, does that not make your conscience ache?

Kjerag Warrior:
You...

Kjerag Civilian A:
You have a point...

Kjerag Civilian B:
That's right. No matter what the circumstances are, an attack on Sir Enciodes is simply going too far.

Kjerag Civilian A:
Besides, to do it during a ceremony as important as the Holy Hunt is also a grave insult to Kjeragandr.

Kjerag Civilian C:
Exactly! No matter what the facts are regarding this situation, there must be some kind of explanation!

Kjerag Civilian B:
You said it.

Kjerag Civilian A:
That's right, the perpetrator must be found!

Kjarr:
What's wrong? Didn't sleep well last night? You don't look so good.

Kjarr:
Mm. Word of it has spread, and everyone's talking about.

Kjarr:
I can see that many people are already demanding an explanation for this matter.

Kjarr:
Judging from the look on your face, did you not expect this at all?

Kjarr:
Huh? Then what's got you in a twist?

Kjarr:
Gnosis doesn't see eye to eye with Enciodes, and he's been plotting to overthrow him since they parted ways.

Kjarr:
You didn't think Enciodes would leave himself so open, nor did you want to interfere in the affairs of the three clans, so you came to the ceremony as a guest.

Kjarr:
I'm just talking about superficial appearances here. From that angle, that is how the situation seems, right?

Kjarr:
I don't have a clue what goes on in that head of yours all day.

Kjarr:
But I feel like you've infected me into enjoying thinking about these things, so let's do just that.

Kjarr:
Hmm... Since Enciodes used to be good friends with Gnosis and we know the latter to be a crafty man, he must've been prepared for Gnosis's betrayal from the very beginning.

Kjarr:
But he was attacked anyway, and it became a pretty big deal...

Kjarr:
In other words, he engineered this situation to become more sympathetic in the eyes of the public?

Kjarr:
But, what exactly does this accomplish?

Kjarr:
Right now, the Holy Hunt party should be on its way back.

Kjarr:
Shortly, the Grand Ceremony come to its final ritual, including the ceremonial crowning of the Saintess.

Kjarr:
If he can catch the perpetrator at the ceremony, that'll increase people's faith in Enciodes... but that's it, right?

Kjarr:
What would that be?

Great Elder:
The Saintess shot and killed the prey herself during the Holy Hunt?

Elder A:
Yes.

Great Elder:
And news of the attack on Enciodes has already spread among the people.

Elder B:
Yes.

Elder A:
Not only that, but a number of people are demanding that the perpetrator be punished before the coronation ceremony.

Elder C:
To injure a countryman during the Holy Hunt is to gravely disrespect Kjeragandr. Of course this deserves punishment!

Elder B:
But, this is still the Saintess's coronation ceremony.

Elder A:
Both of you bring up good points... Great Elder, your judgment?

Great Elder:
......

Great Elder:
Given Enciodes's superb abilities, there is little chance that the mastermind behind this will not be sniffed out, regardless of who it is––

Great Elder:
If only things were that simple.

Elder A:
Please do explain, Great Elder.

Great Elder:
The Saintess's behavior has gone increasingly out-of-line, yet Enciodes's response has been quite uncharacteristic.

Great Elder:
What are those siblings planning?

Elder A:
What does the Great Elder mean by 'those siblings?'

Great Elder:
No, there is no possibility of any collusion between the two.

Great Elder:
But perhaps, this is the Silverash blood that runs through their veins––

Kjerag Warrior:
Everyone, the Elders, the Great Elder, and the Saintess's teams are about to arrive.

Great Elder:
Enough. Let's go to meet the Saintess.

Kjerag Civilian A:
Hurry, it's the Holy Hunt party!

Kjerag Civilian B:
Look, Sir Enciodes's wounds have been bandaged!

Kjerag Civilian C:
The rumors were true after all!

Kjerag Civilian A:
Great Saintess, please deliver justice for Sir Enciodes!

Kjerag Civilian B:
Find the perpetrator who sabotaged the Holy Hunt!

Kjerag Noble A:
Matriarch Ratatos and Sir Arctosz appear ill at ease.

Kjerag Noble B:
Might they be connected in some way to this incident?

Kjerag Civilian A:
The Great Elder is here!

Kjerag Civilian B:
The Vine-Bear Court must uphold justice for Sir Enciodes!

Kjerag Civilian C:
We won't accept this ceremony if you just try to sweep things under the rug and move on!

Enciodes:
My friends, I am very grateful for your concern.

Enciodes:
Though the perpetrator has not been found yet, it is only a matter of time.

Enciodes:
For now, let us first prioritize the ceremony.

Enciodes:
What say you, Saintess?

Enya:
As Sir Enciodes is so faithful to Kjeragandr, I have no objections.

Great Elder:
Then, children of Kjeragandr, know that this year's ceremony holds a different meaning.

Great Elder:
The proposal by the head of the Silverash clan, Enciodes, to have the Saintess restored to power passed the previous Tri-Clan Council, and this was announced throughout our territory.

Great Elder:
And today, on the day of Kjerag's grandest celebration, we hold the coronation ceremony for the Saintess.

Great Elder:
This will also be the last ceremony that I preside over.

Great Elder:
Kjeragandr gave Her own flesh to the Paleroche clan, making the land fertile so that the people of Kjerag would go hungry no longer.

Arctosz:
Valais.

Valais:
Sir.

???:
I am a researcher. Even should I lie, I would never lie about my research.

???:
You may distrust the results of my analysis, yet you still hold onto my sample from back then.

???:
You can use it as an experiment, to verify the things that I said.

???:
Or, are you ready to accept this 'truth?'

???:
Do you truly believe that your father died for 'blaspheming Kjeragandr?'

Valais:
......

Valais respectfully brings forth a cup of wine.

This cup represents a bountiful harvest.

Arctosz:
I offer this wine made from nourishing grain to Kjeragandr, so that we may be blessed with a bountiful harvest next year.

The Great Elder receives the wine and drinks it in one gulp.

Arctosz:
As head of the Paleroche clan, I, Arctosz Paleroche, pay the highest tribute to Kjeragandr.

Enya:
Your prayers will surely reach Kjeragandr.

Great Elder:
Kjeragandr gave Her own hide to the Browntail clan, making the forests lush and full of beast-life so that the people of Kjerag would no longer succumb to the cold.

Ratatos:
Yucatan.

Yucatan:
Matriarch.

Yucatan respectfully brings forth a scarf.

This scarf represents comfort and good health.

Ratatos:
I offer this cloth knit from warming fur to Kjeragandr, so that we may be blessed with comfort and good health next year.

The Great Elder takes the scarf and drapes it across the Saintess.

Ratatos:
As head of the Browntail clan, I, Ratatos Browntail, pay the highest tribute to Kjeragandr.

Enya:
Your prayers will surely reach Kjeragandr.

Great Elder:
Finally, Kjeragandr gave Her own bones to the Silverash clan, making the mountains rich with metal so that the people of Kjerag could forge tools and weapons.

Enciodes:
Matterhorn.

Matterhorn:
Sir.

Matterhorn respectfully brings forth a small knife.

This small knife represents peace.

Enciodes:
I offer this weapon of refined ore to Kjeragandr, so that we may be blessed with peace next year.

The Great Elder takes the knife and hands it to the Saintess with both hands.

Enciodes:
As head of the Silverash clan, I, Enciodes Silverash, pay the highest tribute to Kjeragandr.

Enya:
Your prayers will surely reach Kjeragandr.

Great Elder:
Next––

Weiss:
Master, the perpetrator has been found.

Enciodes:
Great Elder, now that the perpetrator has been found, I know not whether to continue the ceremony or interrogate the perpetrator.

Kjerag Civilian A:
This perpetrator must be brought to justice!

Kjerag Civilian B:
That's right! The perpetrator must be punished!

Great Elder:
Since the people worry about this matter, bring the perpetrator.

Enciodes:
Very well.

Enciodes:
Come.

Ratatos:
......!

Sciurus:
(Monch?!)

Sciurus:
(What's going on? Why is Monch in custody? D-Does this have something to do with the assassination attempt?!)

Sciurus:
(Dammit, that idiot!)

Yucatan:
(Wait, Rus, what are you doing?!)

Great Elder:
Assassin who dares disrupt the Holy Hunt, state your name.

Monch:
......

Great Elder:
Why... *could* *cough*... would you seek to take Sir Enciodes's life?

Monch:
......

Monch:
I kill what needs to die.

Great Elder:
......

Great Elder:
Assassin, keeping your mouth shut will not spare your life.

Great Elder:
Your sacrilege against Kjeragandr during a sacred ceremony is a sin that must be punished accordingly.

Great Elder:
Know that if you persist, then by the Commandments, I can order your execution on the spot!

Monch:
......

Great Elder:
Fine. Then you shall be dealt with according to the Commandments.

Great Elder:
Even if you choose not to speak, your identity will not be difficult to uncover.

Monch:
......

Sciurus:
Wait, hold on!

Monch:
––!

Yucatan:
Sciurus!

Sciurus:
Yucatan, what are you doing? Let go of me!

Sciurus:
Monch is one of my people! I won't let you hurt her!

Great Elder:
Is this true, Sciurus?

Ratatos:
...Sciurus! You get back here this instant!

Ratatos:
This isn't the time or place to be fooling around. Yucatan, get your wife under control!

Yucatan:
...Rus, you don't understand the situation. Let's not make a scene here, alright?

Yucatan:
Come, over here, by me.

Sciurus:
What am I not understanding? And I am not making a scene!

Sciurus:
They're all like that. If I didn't speak up, they would've condemned Monch as an assassin!

Sciurus:
I—

Ratatos:
Silence!!

Sciurus:
––!

Sciurus:
Ratatos, I...

Monch:
......

Great Elder:
Looks like that saves us the trouble of identifying the assassin.

Great Elder:
Detain Sciurus.

Sciurus:
W-Wait, why are you arresting me?!

Sciurus:
I'm telling you, I never had Monch do anything of the sort! Someone must be trying to frame us!

Ratatos:
......

Ratatos:
Great Elder, surely it cannot be appropriate to use force against a member of the Browntail clan solely due to the words of an insignificant person who knows nothing of the situation.

Ratatos:
As you can see, my stupid little sister could not possibly seek to assassinate Sir Enciodes, for she clearly lacks the brain cells to do so.

Sciurus:
Hey, what are you trying to say?!

Ratatos:
I told you to shut up!

Ratatos:
(...Sciurus, know your place.)

Sciurus:
......

Great Elder:
What, you mean to say that your sister has been deceived, Ratotos? Do you not find something unusual about that?

Ratatos:
Very perceptive, Great Elder.

Great Elder:
*cough* *cough*... Enciodes... *cough*... What do you think?

Enciodes:
Ratatos has always treated me kindly. and I have always trusted her. Even if we have our differences, I believe she would not resort to such drastic measures.

Ratatos:
......

Enciodes:
Ratatos, I have no reason to believe you to be of so little faith as to behave in such a manner during a celebration of Kjeragandr.

Enciodes:
While my well-being is of little consequence, this disrespect to Kjeragandr cannot be tolerated.

Ratatos:
What do you mean by that?

Enciodes:
Now that we know that the perpetrator is a member of the Browntail clan, no one will believe the empty rhetoric that the Browntails have nothing to do with this matter.

Enciodes:
Without providing some concrete evidence, or turning over the real perpetrator, even if I am willing to turn the other cheek... I'm afraid that the house of Browntail will be hard-pressed to convince the public.

Ratatos:
......

Ratatos feels that she can understand the man's meaning, but the buzzing of those words inside her ears... is far too thunderous to bear.

The entire ceremony is awash with turmoil. She has never once felt the gaze of the surrounding people in such a way before - full of distrust and hostility, like barbs in her back.

Sciurus also seems to be saying something to her, and not in her usual sharp shouts, her lips are silently quivering.

Ratatos can tell from a glance what her voiceless words are. In the past, the two of them played similar tricks without the notice of adults.

Her sister says:

'But, I just wanted to do something for the Browntail clan!'

Ratatos:
......

Enciodes:
Great Elder, what is your opinion?

Great Elder:
*cough*... Your words ring true, Enciodes... *cough* *cough*...

Enciodes:
Great Elder, is there something wrong?

Great Elder:
I'm fine... *gurgle*...

Devotee:
Great Elder, what's happening?!

Great Elder:
......

Devotee:
There's some green liquid coming from the Great Elder's lips... He's been poisoned!

Devotee:
Someone poisoned the Great Elder!

Enya:
Let me see.

Devotee:
Stay back, Saintess! There may be other poison!

Enya:
I'm not afraid.

Enya:
No... the poison is too potent and is suppressing my healing Arts. I can only barely maintain the Great Elder's life for a while.

Devotee:
Who would poison the Great Elder?! And, when...

Devotee:
Wine! It must've been that cup of wine that Arctosz offered to the Great Elder!

Enya:
Bring the cup!

Devotee:
H-Here it is!

Enya:
Without a doubt... there are traces of poison.

Arctosz:
That's impossible!

Enciodes:
...So that's your game.

Enciodes:
Arctosz, I never could've imagined that you would dare poison the Great Elder in your bid to take over Kjerag!

Arctosz:
What?! What reason would I possibly have to poison the Great Elder?!

Enciodes:
Hmph. The Paleroche clan has always been on good terms with the Vine-Bear Court, but you leveraged this relationship to gain many privileges throughout Kjerag. The people gathered here are all witnesses to that.

Enciodes:
Over these years, you have used this privilege to suppress me, something I endure to this day. You have all seen this with your own eyes.

Enciodes:
And now, even as I have compromised by proposing to return temporal power to the Saintess, you still have to terrorize the house of Silverash.

Enciodes:
Once the Saintess holds all the power and the three clans are equal under her leadership, will the Paleroche clan still enjoy its privileges as it does now?

Enciodes:
Perhaps because the Great Elder was no longer willing to support you, you then chose to contact Madame Sciurus, plotting the scheme unfolding before our very eyes.

Enciodes:
Madame Sciurus was responsible for assassinating me, you would poison the Great Elder, and the two of you would take advantage of the situation to seize power in Kjerag... Not a bad plan, Arctosz.

Arctosz:
You dare slander me, Enciodes!

Enciodes:
Slander?

Enciodes:
It is a fact that your clan is on good terms with the Vine-Bear Court. It is a fact that the Browntail clan is now allied with yours. It is a fact that the Elders agreed to return temporal power to the Saintess.

Enciodes:
And as of now, it is a fact that you poisoned the Great Elder.

Enciodes:
I would ask all of you present to pass judgment – am I the one who slanders, or is Arctosz the one who deceives?!

Kjerag Civilian A:
But... Sir Arctosz isn't that kind of person...

Kjerag Civilian B:
Sir Enciodes was injured during the Holy Hunt, and a Browntail was responsible. Now, Arctosz poisoned the Great Elder. What is there to doubt?

Kjerag Civilian C:
I can't believe I had such a wrong impression of Arctosz! I never thought he was faking his piety all these years!

Kjerag Civilian A:
...I refuse to believe it!

Kjerag Civilian B:
Wake up already!

Enciodes:
Pin down the murderer and Madame Sciurus.

Silverash Clan Warrior:
Right away.

Sciurus:
Get your hands off me, you bastard!

Yucatan:
Sciurus!

Yucatan:
Matriarch...!

Ratatos:
Wait––

Silverash Clan Warrior:
Guh...

Matterhorn:
Who's there?!

Weiss:
Ice Arts, and from such a long range? Could it be––

Kjerag Noble A:
Who is it?!

Kjerag Noble B:
Look over there!

???:
Warriors, it's time to rescue your clan leader.

Kjerag Noble A:
That's... Gnosis! Why is he here, and, why are the Browntails with him?!

Kjerag Noble B:
I haven't heard from him since he was blacklisted from Karlan Trade. From the looks of things, he's defected to the Browntail clan?!

Gnosis:
Enciodes, you've gone to such great lengths to paint yourself as some pious victim, making your high-and-mighty proclamations atop that stage of yours. Have you no sense of shame?

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
I was wondering where you were hiding, Gnosis. Turns out you fell in with Ratatos.

Gnosis:
Hiding? No, I've been biding my time for this moment.

Gnosis:
Ratatos, what are you hesitating for?

Ratatos:
Gnosis, you––

Gnosis:
Take a good look at the people around you, and the distrust they harbor for you in their eyes!

Kjerag Civilian A:
Ratatos has betrayed Kjeragandr! She must be punished!

Kjerag Civilian B:
Arctosz, I thought better of you!

Kjerag Civilian C:
Strike them down, Sir Enciodes! Strike them down!!

Gnosis:
Get a good look at your sister. Enciodes is about to take her away!

Sciurus:
Let go! Let go of me!!

Yucatan:
Don't you dare hurt my wife!

Silverash Clan Warrior:
Hmph!

Yucatan:
Argh...

Sciurus:
Yucatan!

Ratatos:
Sciurus! Yucatan!

Gnosis:
Now is your last chance.

Gnosis:
Enciodes said that he trusted you. But did he ever actually trust you?

Gnosis:
You should've seen through this long ago. He's just forcing you to make a decision. But do you really think you can protect your Browntail clan simply by turning over the 'assassin' that he wants?

Gnosis:
Look around you. See how the people are looking at you.

Gnosis:
Do you have any idea what will become of your clans should Enciodes take over Kjerag?

Ratatos:
I...

Yucatan:
Matriarch!

Ratatos:
......

Gnosis:
Ratatos, don't tell me that you intend to protect neither your clan nor your lands, and instead will simply relinquish your public image and privileges?

Gnosis:
If you still choose to do nothing, even at this point...

Gnosis:
Then allow me to help you.

Gnosis turns to look at Enciodes.

Ice-blue Arts condense in the palm of his hand, but Enciodes remains unfazed.

Enciodes:
Gnosis, you disappoint me.

Gnosis:
What a coincidence, Enciodes. I was just thinking the same thing.

Enciodes:
––Degenbrecher.

Gnosis:
Guh...

Degenbrecher:
As you should know, these Arts are nothing to me.

Degenbrecher:
Alright, don't waste my time.

Degenbrecher:
Let's put you down, Gnosis.

Degenbrecher:
How pathetic.

Gnosis:
Pathetic?

Gnosis:
Even if you strike me down here today, it won't do you any good.

Gnosis:
You may be able to stop one person, or even a hundred people. But can you stop a thousand? Ten thousand?

Gnosis:
Look behind me.

Gnosis:
The flames have been lit.

Ratatos:
......

Ratatos:
Grr.

Ratatos:
Arctosz.

Arctosz:
What?

Ratatos:
Do you believe me, or Enciodes?!

Arctosz:
I don't trust either of you!

Ratatos:
Then you should at least know very clearly now, who the real enemy is!

Ratatos:
Browntail clan warriors, prepare for battle!

Ratatos:
First, we rescue Sciurus. Then, bring Enciodes to me!

Browntail Clan Warrior:
Yes, Matriarch!

Arctosz:
Fy faen... Paleroche warriors, in formation!

Arctosz:
Take down the traitor! Expose to the masses that Enciodes is the real traitor!

Gulo:
Yessir!

Paleroche Clan Warrior:
Yessir!

Enciodes:
Degenbrecher.

Enciodes:
Get Gnosis.

Degenbrecher:
You don't need me?

Enciodes:
I don't.

Degenbrecher:
Alright.

Enciodes:
Matterhorn.

Matterhorn:
Sir.

Enciodes:
Take care of the Great Elder and the Saintess.

Matterhorn:
Right away.

Enciodes:
Weiss.

Weiss:
Sir.

Enciodes:
Bring me Arctosz and Ratatos.

Enciodes:
Try to avoid taking any lives. Now isn't the time for that.

Weiss:
Understood.

Weiss:
It shall be done.

Kjarr:
......

Kjarr:
So what was all of that?

Kjarr:
Didn't we know that all along?

Kjarr:
Huh?

Kjarr:
Do you mean that––

Sharp:
Your orders, Doctor?

Sharp:
...I'm not sure I understand.

Sharp:
...I need a reason to act, Doctor. This goes beyond my duty to protect you.

Sharp:
......

Sharp:
My duty is to uphold Rhodes Island's interests, and protect you.

Sharp:
And from a practical standpoint, the things going on here have nothing to do with you, Doctor.

Sharp:
Even if Enciodes wins, no harm would come to you, as you are his guest.

Sharp:
From another perspective, he was the one who formed business ties with Rhodes Island, not the other two clans, let alone Kjerag as a whole.

Sharp:
If anything, interfering with Enciodes's plans is more likely to threaten Rhodes Island's interests, as well as put your safety at risk.

Sharp:
......

Sharp:
Doctor, people are dying in every corner of this world.

Sharp:
If you go around committed to saving people, genuinely devoting yourself to that cause, you're just going to end up overcome with guilt when you fail.

Sharp:
I break with a lot of Rhodes Island when I often find myself thinking that saving and protecting lives is kind of pointless.

Sharp:
I believe in the victories you bring, and the discernable value that comes with those victories.

Sharp:
Kjerag's population is in the millions. The people you are talking about aren't just a few. Not dozens, or hundreds, but tens of thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands.

Sharp:
...Is this the victory you promised today?

Sharp:
Alright. I'll see it done.

Silverash Clan Warrior:
Guh...

Silverash Clan Warrior:
Ugh... Launching a sneak attack during the chaos? Don't let them get away!

Yucatan:
Sciurus!

Sciurus:
Yucatan!

Yucatan:
Hurry!

Weiss:
Stop!

Yucatan:
Out of the way!

Weiss:
Stand down, Yucatan of the Browntail clan.

Weiss:
If you come peacefully, the Master will treat you mercifully. He has no interest in taking your lives.

Yucatan:
(As long as Rus can get away––)

Yucatan:
Gah...

Yucatan:
*cough*... Rus, hurry...

Weiss:
Sorry.

Browntail Clan Warrior:
Hurry, Sciurus!

Sciurus:
Yucatan is still back there! And, Monch too!

Ratatos:
You're still talking about the assassin? You idiot!

Sciurus:
...She didn't do anything!

Sciurus:
......

Sciurus:
But Yucatan... What about Yucatan?! He's my husband!

Ratatos:
Look at what's going on around you! Yucatan sacrificed everything to save you, and you plan on jumping back into the fire?!

Sciurus:
So you're just going to abandon him?!

Ratatos:
If I was giving up on him, I wouldn't be fighting back!

Ratatos:
Now stop being a damned fool!

Sciurus:
Fine fine, I'll just keep running!

Sciurus:
(Yucatan...)

Gulo:
Gah... Where'd these freaks and their weird armor come from?

Gulo:
Sir, Enciodes's forces outnumber us too heavily! We're getting overwhelmed!

Gulo:
What do we do?

Arctosz:
There are no cowards in the Paleroche clan!

Ratatos:
Arctosz, stop trying to play the hero! We need to team up and cut our way out of here!

Arctosz:
How do you expect me to live that down?!

Ratatos:
You won't have a say in the matter if you die here!

Arctosz:
Dammit... Damn it all!

Arctosz:
Gulo, gather the warriors and follow me! We're going to break out of here!

Gulo:
Yessir!

Weiss:
(*whispers*) Sorry about this.

Weiss:
The Tschäggättä already have this place surrounded.

Weiss:
You still have the option to surrender before you pass the point of no return.

Arctosz:
Lackey of Enciodes, you speak only lies! We will fight our way out!

Weiss:
I would prefer if you calmed down first. You stand no chance.

Weiss:
You can't run.

???:
Actually, they can.

Weiss:
Who's there?

A tall man stands in the corner at the entrance of a corridor, under the shadows of the eaves.

Behind him, several Tschäggättä, who were supposed to have the perimeter secured, lie in the corridor.

Out from the shadows strides one of the operators most familiar to Courier during the time he spent at Rhodes Island.

He knows exactly what this means.

Ratatos:
You... Who are you?

Arctosz:
You're... that Doctor's...

Ratatos:
Why are you saving us?

Sharp:
It's not my job to tell you things.

Sharp:
The exit is this way. I've already dealt with the guards outside.

Sharp:
Aurora, escort them out.

Aurora:
Got it!

Tschäggättä:
You aren't getting away!

Tschäggättä:
Urgh...

Sharp:
Who's next? Try me.

Weiss:
Don't do anything rash! Get in formation!

Tschäggättä:
Get in formation? Just for a single person?

Weiss:
GET IN FORMATION!!

Tschäggättä:
...Understood.

Sharp:
Very good.

Weiss:
Captain Sharp...

Weiss:
I'm so sorry.

Sharp:
There's no need to apologize to me, Courier. Nothing personal.

Sharp:
It's just business.

Fifteen minutes later...

Aurora:
Captain! You... You're injured?

Sharp:
There were a lot of 'em, and Courier's blade is still pretty quick.

Aurora:
Captain... Courier, he...

Sharp:
I spared him, don't worry.

Aurora:
So, what's next?

Sharp:
We're all done with work over here.

Sharp:
On to the next job.

Matterhorn:
How's the Great Elder doing?

Vine-Bear Court Medic:
It's not looking good.

Matterhorn:
Send the Great Elder back to the Vine-Bear Court. Sir Enciodes will arrange for a special doctor.

Matterhorn:
And, great Saintess, Sir Enciodes has invited you to return to the Vine-Bear Court and hold the coronation ceremony again after things have settled down.

Enya:
...I know.

Enya does not resist. She knows that right now, she does not have the leeway to resist.

From a certain point onward, she has known that this was all staged farce.

And the one who set this farce in motion... was her very own brother.

He ruthlessly shattered all the mental preparations she made for this moment, as well as her vision for the future.

Even if she could take down everyone standing in front of her right now, the people would still ask her to take the position that Enciodes prepared for her in the Vine-Bear Court.

She looks all around her.

When she sees Matterhorn take notice of her gaze, she deliberately looks away.

She sees the combatants clad in modern, cutting-edge equipment tearing through the formation of Silverash warriors, escorting Arctosz and Ratatos away.

She sees the eyes of the people focused on Enciodes, like a rapt audience in front of a theater's master.

She sees the hope and fervor in their eyes.

She sees Kjarr, and she sees the person standing next to her–you.

Your eyes meet, and within them, you see sorrow, reluctance, and–– fury.

All fleeting emotions.

She finally averts her eyes, and takes a step forward.

Silverash Clan Warrior:
Master! Rhodes Islanders suddenly rushed in to help Arctosz and Ratatos escape!

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
Dr. {@nickname}.

Enciodes:
You... always keep me on my toes.

Degenbrecher:
All this happened in the piddling amount of time it took me to suppress Gnosis?

Enciodes:
I must say, Rhodes Island's attack indeed surpassed my expectations. I did consider the possibility of them intervening, but underestimated their strength. This time, it is I whose plans have been forcefully disrupted.

Degenbrecher:
Should I go after them?

Enciodes:
There's no need. I still have a backup plan.

Enciodes:
Moreover, whether or not those two die here has no bearing on what I'm going to do next.

Enciodes:
Dr. {@nickname} must've realized as much, to make a decision like this.

Enciodes:
What do you think comes next?

Degenbrecher:
Assuming this Doctor isn't an impulsive fool, then these two still have a role to play.

Degenbrecher:
As for what comes next...

Degenbrecher:
Since you seem to hold this person in such high regard, then it isn't surprising to me that your Doctor would take advantage of this opportunity to manipulate the two clans into an obstacle for you.

Enciodes:
I do not take the Doctor for such a flamboyant daredevil.

Degenbrecher:
You seem to really 'understand' this Doctor.

Enciodes:
It's just my intuition. My intuition as a chessmaster.

Enciodes:
However, an outsider has rescued the heads of the Paleroche and Browntail clans...

Enciodes:
Even I cannot fathom what one can achieve in this situation.

Enciodes:
So, I am most curious as to what comes next.

Enciodes:
Of course, if what you said is true, then I eagerly await our match.

Degenbrecher:
Let's just call it a day and shove those thoughts back in your head. You're the victor of today's mess.

Degenbrecher:
Everyone is waiting to hear from the victor.

Enciodes:
I know.

The scene left behind by the turmoil has not yet been cleaned up, and the people are heatedly discussing what just took place.

But as Enciodes slowly makes his way to center stage, everyone stops what they are doing, and they all turn to look at him.

The crowd is waiting for him to pen the denouement to this farce.

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
People of Kjerag, I am so sorry.

Enciodes:
It pains my heart greatly to see such tragic events unfold on a holy day.

Enciodes:
But this has given us an opportunity to see who the true traitors are in the land of Kjerag.

Enciodes:
They are none other than Arctosz and Ratatos!

Enciodes:
They were dissatisfied by the changes brought about by my proposal to relinquish our powers, and tried to assassinate me and poison the Great Elder to seize control of all Kjerag.

Enciodes:
Without a doubt, there can be no greater blasphemy to Kjeragandr.

Enciodes:
Though they managed to escape justice just now, I swear that this matter shall not end here.

Enciodes:
Arctosz and Ratatos will be given fair trial, without fail!

Enciodes:
Though in my heart, I truly wanted to see these individuals captured and brought to justice, I had no intention of starting a conflict.

Enciodes:
Kjerag is the land of Kjeragandr, the land of all who dwell in the icy mountains. It does not belong to me.

Enciodes:
As such, let it be known to all people of the Paleroche and Browntail clans – there shall be no civil war, as that is something we all are worried about.

Enciodes:
Consequently, my Silverash warriors will only be deployed to protect the Vine-Bear Court. We will await the Great Elder's recovery, and then discuss Kjerag's future together with the Saintess.

Enciodes:
But, I hope that the people of the Paleroche and Browntail clans can at least clearly see who the true enemies of Kjerag are.

Enciodes:
I believe that we will surely find a better path forward when all our interests are aligned.

Enciodes:
When that time comes, we will be able to usher in a better Kjerag.
