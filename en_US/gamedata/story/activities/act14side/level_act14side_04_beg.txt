Kjerag Commoner A:
Dear, would you look at that. Isn't that Sir Enciodes?

Kjerag Commoner B:
Impossible. Tomorrow is the day of the Holy Hunt. The Master is surely preparing his offerings to the Saintess, so why would he be patrolling his territory so early in the morning?

Kjerag Commoner B:
Wait, that really is Sir Enciodes!

Kjerag Commoner A:
I heard it used to be forbidden to ride burdenbeasts to Mount Karlan.

Kjerag Commoner A:
Especially those seeking an audience with the Saintess. They had to keep their palms together, eyes on the ground, head bowed in prayer from the moment they left home.

Kjerag Commoner A:
Look at the Master now. Does he intend to follow the old tradition?

Kjerag Commoner B:
Yeah, I've heard of that tradition before, but the Master... Even someone of his status intends to walk up the mountain one step at a time with his head bowed?

Kjerag Commoner A:
What are you talking about? The Master is also a child of Kjeragandr. Don't tell me you're one of those Paleroche idiots who've forgotten the scriptures.

Kjerag Commoner B:
What kind of fool do you take me for? That's not what I meant!

Kjerag Commoner B:
I'm just worried about the Master. You know as well as I do that the other two clans are insatiable. The Master proposed to return the Saintess to power, and they weren't too happy about that.

Kjerag Commoner B:
They are jealous of all the progress that the Master has brought, and even sabotaged one of our railways. I heard they're in bed together now, working to keep Kjerag sealed.

Kjerag Commoner A:
They wouldn't dare. Resorting to violence right before Kjeragandr's eyes would anger Her.

Kjerag Commoner B:
Is there anything they wouldn't do?

Kjerag Commoner B:
Today, the Master is walking through the streets unarmed. Tomorrow, the three clans will be sending their forces up to the mountains to hunt. What kind of blasphemy could they possibly commit?

Kjerag Commoner A:
Hush, you're going to invite misfortune if you keep talking like that! O Kjeragandr, please bless the Master with a safe journey!

Kjerag Commoner B:
O Kjeragandr, please bless the Master with a safe journey!

Kjerag Noble:
Enciodes, I didn't think we'd see any worshippers as devout as you in this day and age!

Weiss:
My apologies, Mr. Pale. The Master is participating in an important ceremony and has to pray all the way there, so he cannot answer you right now.

Weiss:
But allow me to offer you my regards on his behalf.

Kjerag Noble:
No worries, I am the one at fault. O Kjeragandr, please forgive me.

Kjerag Noble:
However, the road from Turicum to Karlan is long, and I'm afraid that others will be worried if they see Enciodes like this.

Weiss:
Don't worry. The Master made up his mind to do this long ago.

Weiss:
We will protect him all the way.

Kjerag Noble:
That's a relief. May Kjeragandr bless Silverash.

Weiss:
May Kjeragandr bless you as well.

Enya:
It always feels like the beasts start panicking before the hunt even begins.

Kjarr:
You can tell how the beasts are behaving just from looking out the window?

Enya:
From the shifting of the snow.

Kjarr:
That being said, make sure you watch your feet tomorrow on the day of the Holy Hunt.

Kjarr:
The Great Elder is here.

Enya:
Ugh. I have plenty of things to watch out for as it is.

Great Elder:
Are you ready, Enya?

Enya:
I've prepared my luggage and my speech.

Enya:
Don't worry, Great Elder, this isn't the first time I've done this ceremony.

Great Elder:
This one will be unlike anything in the past.

Enya:
I heard that Enciodes is coming to visit Kjeragandr.

Great Elder:
It's good that he's willing to show piety at a time like this.

Great Elder:
Silverash also ordered a number of idols from the Vine-Bear Court not long ago, and enshrined them in places that lacked them.

Enya:
Did Enciodes really become so religious overnight?

Elder A:
Saintess, whether or not his devotion is true is for Her to judge. It is not our place.

Elder A:
But, even those ignorant of Kjeragandr will be converted and pray to her after seeing a majestic aurora.

Elder A:
Looking at things this way, to become devout overnight is actually a manifestation of Her power.

Great Elder:
Regardless of Enciodes's motivations, his conduct is beyond reproach.

Great Elder:
As long he upholds the faith with his actions, then there is nothing for you to be concerned about, Saintess.

Great Elder:
In the end, all the people of Kjerag must bow to thousands of years of tradition.

Enya:
I hope so.

Great Elder:
Enciodes aside, the other two clan leaders will head up the mountain and wait.

Great Elder:
Since you will be accepting the transfer of power from the three clans, your speech will need to be more than just satisfactory.

Great Elder:
Whether during the Holy Hunt or the ceremony itself, if you seem to display any sort of bias towards the three clans, people will immediately interpret that as a sign that a clan has gained or lost power.

Enya:
I understand the significance of the bell that I hold, and have thought extensively about how to wield it.

Enya:
There's just one more thing, the hunting longbow. Please allow me to use it.

Great Elder:
Enya, you are familiar with the records of the previous Saintesses, and should know that the Saintess is not required to personally join the hunt. Were you planning to use this longbow at the ceremony initiating the Holy Hunt?

Enya:
Although the Saintess is not required to personally join the hunt, it should not be an affront to Kjeragandr if she does so.

Great Elder:
This has been the tradition in the Vine-Bear Court for thousands of years. You must not disregard your status, Saintess.

Great Elder:
The Saintess must accept the offerings of the three clans on behalf of Kjeragandr, bestowing food upon Kjeragandr's children in Her place during the ceremony.

Great Elder:
What would it mean if the Saintess hunted the prey with her own hands?

Great Elder:
Besides, this isn't some kind of safari for your amusement.

Enya:
You're right. In thousands of years, there has never been a precedent for the three clans to cede power to the Vine-Bear Court.

Enya:
The transfer of power was originally meant to be a peacekeeping measure, but these days, turmoil wells up beneath Mount Karlan, and the land meant to be handed to the Saintess is being senselessly torn apart.

Enya:
As if they are not afraid to blaspheme Kjeragandr.

Great Elder:
Kjeragandr's children need the Saintess to appease Her anger and show Her that the pious hearts of the people of Kjerag have not changed for thousands of years.

Enya:
Maybe what Kjeragandr needs is a Saintess who will convey her wrath.

Great Elder:
Don't invite ill omens within the temple.

Enya:
And in addition, 'those who toil will hold power, and those who idle will suffer.'

Enya:
Though the three clans are supposedly ceding their power to the Saintess, it is not for the sake of handing over any true authority.

Enya:
But in order to maintain the faith's standing, I cannot simply wait for the bounties of the three clans. I am not trying to portray them as incompetent, but rather leading by example.

Great Elder:
If maintaining the faith's standing is what you care about, then it is impossible to speak of change.

Enya:
Kjeragandr's children have already moved forward. The prayers they offer to Her are certainly different from what they were a thousand years ago.

Enya:
And surely, She is not responding to them the same way She did a thousand years ago.

Kjerag Commoner C:
I heard that the Master set off from the old Silverash estate early in the morning and walked all the way here on his two feet, without resting or taking even a single sip of water.

Kjerag Commoner C:
Dad, let's fetch a bowl of water for him.

Kjerag Commoner D:
To follow the old ways, he cannot eat, drink, or sleep the entire way there.

Kjerag Commoner C:
But... it's already been a whole day, dad. Our town is only halfway to Mount Karlan.

Kjerag Commoner C:
He's about to leave, and the sun's going to set too. Who knows what kind of dangers are out there in the snow...

Kjerag Commoner D:
Oh, he's coming...

Silverash's team quietly passes through the street at dusk. Enciodes keeps his head bowed, his palms folded as he silently prays in the direction of Mount Karlan in the distance.

Those who hear his footsteps peek out from the windows curiously, leave their doorways, or stand on both sides of the street.

Kjerag Commoner C:
Dad...

Kjerag Commoner C:
If I can't get him some water to drink... then I want to follow him to the foot of Mount Karlan.

Kjerag Commoner C:
I decided to follow the Master when he opened a factory to teach me about technology. Now that he is demonstrating his faith and going to worship at Mount Karlan, that makes me want to follow him all the more.

Without a word, the people stand up, go down the stairs, and follow the Silverash guards into the snow.
