Sharp:
Status report.

Aurora:
Things aren't quite right. The Doctor's guess was a hit; a lot of people are gathered over here.

Sharp:
Are they setting out for the factories?

Aurora:
Yes... I'm sure of it.

Sharp:
Stay on their tails. Keep me informed.

Aurora:
Roger.

Chester:
And that'll conclude this factory's handover.

Chester:
Everything up till now has been as smooth as ice, thanks to your mediation, Doctor.

Chester:
I might have been a little neglectful beforehand. I'm very sorry for that.

Chester:
My, no need to be so humble. There's plenty still to come that'll require your guidance.

Valais:
One moment.

Chester:
Er, do you have some qualm about this, General Valais?

Valais:
An ambush.

Armed Subject:
That's General Valais for you.

Valais:
Who are you?

Armed Subject:
We're here to get an explanation.

Chester:
Weiss and the Doctor should have just conveyed to the subjects' representatives the steps Karlan Trade's taking.

Chester:
There must have been some misunderstanding...

Armed Subject:
Misunderstanding?

Armed Subject:
Sorry, Mr. Chester, I think you don't get it.

Armed Subject:
Sir Enciodes was tricked by this foreigner!

Armed Subject:
We were all kept in the dark. We only realized what was happening once someone told us.

Armed Subject:
Mr. Chester, you should know this foreigner's 'original' purpose in Kjerag was to advise on Oripathy and Infected handling methods.

Valais:
What's your point?

Chester:
......

Armed Subject:
Our informant is never wrong.

Armed Subject:
This foreigner's already in cahoots with Arctosz, and it's your job to keep eyes on the 'guest', General Valais.

Armed Subject:
Everyone knows Arctosz and the Vine-Bear Court were never happy with how Sir Enciodes opened up Kjerag.

Armed Subject:
The foreigner's going to say the factories spread Oripathy as an excuse to shut them forever with gross slander against the lord!

Valais:
You're the one speaking slander! The Paleroches would never stoop to such unsightly lows!

Armed Subject:
The Paleroches and the Vine-Bear Court are all tied up! You don't think anything 'unsightly?' You don't think enough people have lost their lives?!

Valais:
......

Valais:
Father, Father! Are you alright?

Great Elder:
Come, drink it. Drink and all will be better.

Great Elder:
Kjeragandr's tears will cleanse this taint the Tschäggättä have left.

Valais:
What proof do you have?!

Armed Subject:
Pah! You're asking me to prove your own misdeeds?

Chester:
Doctor, this...

Chester:
Can I trust you?

Armed Subject:
What, hound got your tongue?

Armed Subject:
Don't think you can smooth-talk your way out of this!

Armed Subject:
There's only one thing you need to say! Justify yourself to us!

Valais:
Guards! Protect our guest! Take them away!

Armed Subject:
Get that foreigner now!

Armed Subject:
Wh-Where did you come from?!

Sharp:
It's not safe here!

Aurora:
Time to run, Doctor!

The Ursus operator lifts you onto her shoulders, and leaps into the forest in giant bounds.

Aurora:
Oh! Alright.

Sharp:
*Pant*...

Sharp:
I need to reiterate, Doctor.

Sharp:
No matter what plans you have, this is far too dangerous. You probably don't remember, but I've told you the same thing many, many times before.

Sharp:
Anyone can make mistakes, even me. If you're willing, I hope you can make my work a bit easier on me.

Sharp:
The possibility's not high, but what would you have done if more professional combatants were snuck into that attack?

Sharp:
If they brought crossbows, what then?

Aurora:
I'll report the situation to the Doctor.

Aurora:
Captain Sharp and I both followed your confidant's message, heading separately to the Browntails' residence and the Silverashes' factories to pursue suspicious personnel.

Aurora:
Our trails ended up converging into one, surprisingly enough...

Aurora:
These people were very likely incited by the Browntails.

Aurora:
Agitating civilians and smearing the competition are both common schemes, but they're crude.

Aurora:
What do you mean...?

Sharp:
Their equipment and combat strength aren't up to par. It's not even enough to get them out in one piece.

Sharp:
Suppose they were arrested and interrogated, and they gave up their source...

Aurora:
Then it would look bad for the Browntails?!

Sharp:
We're lacking intel. We still can't see the full picture of this incident. No way to actually lock onto the hidden orchestrator or their goals.

Sharp:
The one thing we can be sure of is someone wants to disturb the tri-clan relations. That is to say, they want to shatter the Snow Realm's overall stability. Circumstances are exceptionally dangerous for outsiders like you, Doctor.

Aurora:
What do we do now, Doctor? Should we think of some way to make it back first?

Sharp:
That's right, this charade's just one small part of the giant storm. But my duty's clear-cut—I'm getting you out of danger, Doctor.

Sharp:
The more you know, the more dangerous your situation. We likely won't have the time to ensure all the details, Doctor.

Sharp:
That might just be the start of it, Doctor.

Sharp:
I have to remind you, Doctor, this may have long grown beyond your plans.

Sharp:
But since you're so determined, and seeing as you have a good grasp on things... we won't stop you.

Sharp:
At this point, do you plan on telling Courier and Matterhorn, and especially Cliffheart, considering they're all Silverashes?

Sharp:
Agreed. I'm sorry to Cliffheart, but now that we're here, it's hard for me to fully trust Courier and Matterhorn.

Sharp:
Doctor, I know you want to trust them, but set aside Cliffheart for now—it's hard for me not to be wary of Courier and Matterhorn in this current tri-clan dispute, no matter what.

Sharp:
Then I choose to keep part of the truth hidden from them.

Valais:
Is there anyone else?

Bodyguard:
None, they've all been suppressed.

Valais:
Then what about the Doctor? Whereabouts?

Bodyguard:
We... saw someone taking the Doctor away, running into the forest.

Valais:
Damn...!

Valais:
You lot, with me! There'd better not be a single scratch on—

Valais:
!!

Chester:
Ah! So you're... I thought you...

Valais:
That was a difficult situation there, and I lost sight of you. I hope you can forgive me.

Valais:
I made a mockery of myself, when I should by all rights have prioritized your safety.

Valais:
As you can see... the people here have all been contained.

Valais:
Don't move! Settle down!

Armed Subject:
Don't think we don't know! You're here just to frame Sir Enciodes.

Armed Subject:
You self-righteous hypocrite! Pah!

Aurora:
......

Aurora:
...Bro?

Sharp:
......？

Armed Subject:
Lara? Why are you here?

Aurora:
Bro! What are you doing?!

Armed Subject:
Wh—Why are you all mixed up with these people?

Aurora:
That's my boss!

Sharp:
Leave it. Now's not the time.

Aurora:
Understood, Captain.

Valais:
What?

Chester:
Have... you told Sir Enciodes about that?

Armed Subject:
You! You! You're a nasty piece of work after all.

Valais:
I don't quite understand, so I have no way to judge if what you say is true.

Valais:
But it sounds at least somewhat reasonable.

Armed Subject:
I'll never believe your vile lies! You! You...

Valais:
I want you to behave or else! Have you given a thought to the sort of punishment you'll face for attacking an outside guest of honor in the Vine-Bear Court's territory?

Armed Subject:
......

Armed Subject:
So long as it's for Sir Enciodes...

Aurora:
The Silverashes' guest attacked by the Silverashes' subjects? Is there any way this won't smear the Silverash reputation?

Aurora:
Is this how you 'repay Sir Enciodes?'

Armed Subject:
...That...

Aurora:
Think about it!

Aurora:
Bro, you used to be so cool-headed. What happened?

Armed Subject:
...Forget it. You wouldn't understand if I told you.

Valais:
What?

Aurora:
General Valais, please be kind...

Valais:
*Sigh*...

Valais:
Is that really all it is? I'm not convinced.

Valais:
*Sigh*... You know what, forget it.

Valais:
...Are you sure this settles it?

Valais:
Listen up, all of you. If it wasn't for our guest's altruism, you'd all be in for a caning before the day is out! Reflect on your actions!

Armed Subject:
Don't think you'll buy us off just like that! You rotten...

Soldier Leader:
Leave it, leave it. We're out of here. Don't disgrace the Silverashes any more than that.

The furious subjects slowly leave, wearing expressions of disappointment and spite as they go. The most vitriolic clash, for the moment, has been defused.

A heavy blizzard is gathering at this moment, of that much you're sure.
