Gnosis:
Are all the preparations in place?

Monch:
Yes.

Monch:
......

Monch:
Sir Gnosis!

Monch:
May I ask you a question...?

Gnosis:
Now this is rare. This might be the first time you've asked me anything.

Gnosis:
Go ahead.

Monch:
If I may be so bold.

Monch:
I'm afraid that the Browntails might get caught up in the investigation that follows, if we go through with our plan.

Monch:
I... I'm just worried that, now that you and the Browntails have formed an alliance, wouldn't it be detrimental to your plan if anything should happen to the Browntails?

Gnosis:
I've considered that, but it doesn't matter. What becomes of the Browntails isn't important. This is a rare opportunity, and I do not want it to go to waste.

Gnosis:
At the same time, I hope you'll know to save your own skin.

Gnosis:
Should worst come to pass, you needn't think about the Browntails. I know Enciodes. If your testimony is useful to him, he won't harm you. At least for the time being.

Gnosis:
And when the time comes, I will send men to ensure your safety.

Monch:
Sir Gnosis! I...

Gnosis:
What's the matter?

Gnosis:
If you are having any second thoughts, we can bring others to execute this plan in your stead.

Monch:
No...! Please, let me do it!

Monch:
Whatever your orders, Sir Gnosis...

Monch:
Your wish is my command.

Old Kjerag Warrior:
We've taken care of all the beasts now!

Old Kjerag Warrior:
Some of the young'uns got a few scratches here and there. Nothing major at all... It's all thanks to you, Great Saintess!

Enya:
I haven't done anything. Rather, all of you have admirably demonstrated your courage in battle. I am sure Kjeragandr is proud of all of you, Her soldiers.

Old Kjerag Warrior:
Y-You flatter us!

Young Kjerag Warrior:
Great Saintess!

Enya:
Hm? You're... the one from earlier...

Young Kjerag Warrior:
Right, it's me. Thank you for saving my life just now!

Arctosz:
Great Saintess! That was far too risky!

Arctosz:
Nonetheless, I have to thank you for saving this runt!

Enya:
We are all children of Kjeragandr, and it's only natural for me to save one of my own.

Young Kjerag Warrior:
Great Saintess...!

Ratatos:
That was truly a fine shot. I didn't know you were such a capable archer...

Enya:
The Saintess must be able to protect the people of the Snow Realm. This is hardly worth mentioning.

Arctosz:
You're too humble! With your shot just now, your marksmanship most definitely rivals even that of Kjerag's finest archers!

Kjerag Warriors:
Great Saintess! Sir Arctosz, Madame Ratatos!

Kjerag Warriors:
T-This is bad!

Ratatos:
What are you babbling about? How is any of this bad?

Ratatos:
You're one of the Silverashes? What's the matter? Don't tell me you were ambushed by beasts and Enciodes is looking for our help.

Kjerag Warriors:
N-No, not beasts!

Arctosz:
Then what is it? Out with it!

Kjerag Warriors:
Y-Yes! Sir Enciodes was ambushed by an assassin!

Enya:
—!

Ratatos:
What did you just say...?

Ratatos:
Enciodes was ambushed? Somebody's so bold to make a move on him during the Holy Hunt?

Arctosz:
Half of you, stay here to protect the Saintess. Stay alert.

Arctosz:
The rest of you, come with me!

Ratatos:
Wait, Arctosz, are you out of your mind?

Ratatos:
What are you doing? Are you going to his aid? Before we even mention whether Enciodes really needs it or not, considering the circumstances... Have you really thought it through?

Arctosz:
There's nothing to think through, Ratatos.

Arctosz:
I know what you are thinking, but it doesn't matter to me one bit whether Enciodes is really turning over a new leaf or is just putting on a show. I, Arctosz, won't permit anyone to make trouble during the Holy Hunt!

Arctosz:
—Generation after generation, my family has sworn to defend Kjerag, and that includes the integrity of the Holy Hunt!

Ratatos:
Can't keep your cool, can you... Whatever, let's see where this kindness of yours will get us.

Enya:
......

Enya:
Enciodes...

Kjerag Warriors:
Sir Enciodes! You're bleeding... Are you hurt?!

Enciodes:
I'm fine. No need to panic.

Kjerag Warriors:
But you're injured!

Enciodes:
It's nothing major.

Enciodes:
Fine stealth techniques. You caught me unaware... though I suppose it was careless of me to assume no one would make trouble during the Holy Hunt.

???:
......

Enciodes:
What's the matter? Not going to show yourself?

Enciodes:
If you had the courage to do this on such an occasion, surely you knew what a great disrespect it was to Kjeragandr.

Enciodes:
Come now. Did you not consider this?

???:
You can stop taunting me...

Monch:
If I'm brave enough to do this, of course I've considered the consequences.

Monch:
Enciodes, if I don't make it out of these hunting grounds today, you're coming down with me!

Enciodes:
Looks like you are truly determined.

Monch:
That goes without saying!

Monch:
Enciodes, you act like a devout follower, but you don't have even the tiniest bit of veneration for Kjeragandr. All of us can see the damage you've brought to Kjerag!

Enciodes:
It's not often that someone says as much to me outright. There aren't that many in Kjerag who bear such a great grudge against me these days, after all.

Enciodes:
For you to criticize me like that, I must have done something to harm your profits... or perhaps you are a truly devout, even radical follower...

Enciodes:
Now which is it?

Monch:
Do you think I'd just tell you?

Kjerag Warriors:
Sir Enciodes, watch out!

Monch:
Out of my way!

Enciodes:
Regrettable.

Enciodes:
You had these berserk beasts prepared in advance, didn't you? I don't have many guards accompanying me during the Holy Hunt, and it's indeed a good chance to strike while they are preoccupied.

Enciodes:
And yet... it looks like you've wasted your one chance.

Monch:
Are you mocking me?

Monch:
You're hurt. It doesn't matter how lightly you make out your injuries, you can't fool me!

Monch:
Your movement is starting to get sluggish, isn't it? I just have to land one more hit and...

Enciodes:
Despite the circumstances?

Enciodes:
Now that we're facing off in the open, how confident are you in landing a fatal shot?

Monch:
Tsk...

Monch:
Let's find out, shall we?

Monch:
Dammit... You can block arrows with that cane?

Monch:
Are you screwing with me?!

Enciodes:
Please don't get the wrong idea. It is not my intention to look down on you.

Enciodes:
You came well-prepared, and you have an excellent plan. However, all plans must face be put into motion, and they rarely survive contact with the enemy.

Enciodes:
My hope is that everything can be solved by diplomacy, but one of my companions possesses exactly that level of violence. Thanks to her, I understand violent people well.

Kjerag Warrior?:
......

Monch:
What are you talking about?!

Enciodes:
Still not showing your true face? Or am I mistaken?

Kjerag Warrior?:
......

Sharp:
......

Sharp:
It's a little hard to slice through an arrow after all.

Monch:
You—!

Sharp:
But that's just part of the job, Mr. Enciodes.

Sharp:
So, will you two keep the fight up?

Enciodes:
That is not for me to decide.

Monch:
......

Enciodes:
Giving up is the best course of action here. At the very least, no lives will be lost.

Monch:
You can drop the kind act. It disgusts me.

Monch:
You want to get information from me, don't you? You want to know who it is that wants your life.

Gnosis:
I've considered that, but it doesn't matter. What becomes of the Browntails isn't important. This is a rare opportunity, and I do not want it to go to waste.

Gnosis:
At the same time, I hope you'll know to save your own skin.

Gnosis:
Should worst come to pass, you needn't think about the Browntails. I know Enciodes. If your testimony is useful to him, he won't harm you. At least for the time being.

Monch:
I...

???:
Monch, Monch!

???:
Where'd you go! Come help take a look at my plan. This one will show Ratatos, for sure!

???:
Oh, Monch, I knew you had my back. Everyone else's always calling me dumb. Hah, they think I don't know...

???:
Monch, tell me. Do you think I make something of the Browntails? I can, right? Right...? Yep! I knew you wouldn't lie to me!

???:
Monch...!

Monch:
......

Monch:
—I won't let you!

Her movement is swift as always, as though she is leaping across a river, and as though she is leaping off a tree.

In an instant, her black figure springs off the ground, before falling and disappearing below the cliffs.

Sharp:
She leapt off...

Enciodes:
An unexpected choice.

Enciodes:
You didn't stop her.

Sharp:
That's not part of my mission.

Sharp:
You don't seem so surprised either.

Enciodes:
There aren't many who can properly set up the pieces on the hunting grounds. If we search for evidence, we're bound to find some.

Enciodes:
Of course, having a witness would've saved us some trouble... Though whether the witness is alive or dead doesn't actually matter all that much.

Sharp:
Your underlings are absent...

Enciodes:
Perhaps they are tied up with the beasts running amok.

Enciodes:
About that, please be sure to thank the Doctor for me.

Sharp:
......

Matterhorn:
Master!

Enciodes:
What's the situation?

Matterhorn:
All taken care of. Some of our men are hurt, but nothing major.

Matterhorn:
I just got some news from Weiss—

Matterhorn:
Sharp? What are you doing here...?

Sharp:
I'm on a mission.

Matterhorn:
Doctor's orders? Did the Doctor anticipate this...?

Sharp:
......

Sharp:
How did you know it was me?

Enciodes:
It's not that hard at all.

Enciodes:
I already told you. I'm very familiar with warriors who can break a deadlock.

Arctosz:
Enciodes!

Arctosz:
Are you alright? Where's the assassin?!

Sharp:
......

Enciodes:
Arctosz, I never expected to see you here. Perhaps this is a portent of the Silverashes and Paleroches finally burying the hatchet?

Arctosz:
Pfft! I'm here, but that's got nothing to do with you!

Arctosz:
I'm only here to flush out the underhanded lowlife who dared to disrupt Kjeragandr's Grand Ceremony! They will pay for this!

Enciodes:
You are truly Kjeragandr's most faithful follower, Arctosz.

Enciodes:
I'm afraid you came too late, though.

Arctosz:
What do you mean? You would never let an assassin go. Where are you hiding him?

Arctosz:
Wait, this cliff... Don't tell me...!

Enciodes:
Exactly, Arctosz. My men will look for any traces of her.

Enciodes:
Let's continue our hunt.

Arctosz:
There's blood on the ground. Are you hurt?

Enciodes:
It's nothing major.

Matterhorn:
Master, we must treat your wounds immediately!

Matterhorn:
We must... We must at least stop the bleeding!

Enciodes:
We're getting back to the hunt.

Enciodes:
I refuse to ruin Kjeragandr's ceremony.

Matterhorn:
......

Enciodes:
Send the word out that all is well.

Matterhorn:
Of course.

Before everyone's eyes, the young head of the Silverash clan takes a step forward.

The snow blows all around him, scattering as he gazes upward. There is not a single scripture that describes such a sight.

The patches of red behind him gradually turn fainter in color, before finally leaving nothing but pure white that blends into the mountainous scenery.

No one can stop him. No one dares to.

Enciodes keeps walking straight ahead.
