Enya:
Thousands of years ago, Kjeragandr descended into this land, naming it Kjerag and bestowing upon it Her eternal vigil.

Enya:
For thousands of years, Her teachings have continued to pervade the lives of all of Kjerag's people.

Enya:
She gave Her flesh to the Paleroche clan, Her hide to the Browntail clan, and Her bones to the Silverash clan.

Enya:
But we all share a common name –– the people of Kjerag.

Enya:
Our belief in Her is the foundation of Kjerag, and is also the reason why we stand here today and call ourselves the children of Kjerag.

Enya:
We all harbor the greatest respect for Her in our hearts, and work together to survive in this land to this day.

Enya:
However, as we all know now, Kjerag is not the only country in this world.

Enya:
Beyond these snow-capped mountains lies a vast world filled with people who do not look like us, do not speak like us, and do not share our belief in Kjeragandr.

Enya:
In the past, we've had terrible disagreements over how to deal with such people.

Enya:
In reality, these disagreements are not an existential crisis. Rather, they are Her way of testing us, Her way of guiding us.

Enya:
She is the object of faith for all the people of Kjerag, our mother and guardian.

Enya:
And as a mother, she never wishes to see her children stagnate.

Enya:
Therefore...

Enya:
Do not let your desire to preserve the old prevent you from trying the new. You are Her children, and you should be full of courage.

Enya:
Do not let your nostalgia for your homeland prevent you from exploring new places. No matter where you go, She will walk with you.

Enya:
Do not let what you already possess prevent you from seeking greater ventures, for you have the right to more in life.

Enya:
After all, She is tolerant. The land She protects should be tolerant, and Her people should also be tolerant.

Enya:
By the authority She has vested in me, I solemnly declare:

Enya:
The Vine-Bear Court will tolerate the beliefs of outsiders towards Kjeragandr.

Enya:
Furthermore, the Vine-Bear Court encourages all citizens to pursue a better life in their own ways.

In the commemoration of the Saintess of Mount Karlan, the Illuminated One, known as the Blessed Enya Silverash, and the resounding speech she delivered to the people of Kjerag––

This day is officially designated a national religious day throughout the land.

Enciodes:
The incident in the valley began as just an idle move.

Enciodes:
I needed someone to distract the Paleroche clan so I could dispatch supplies and personnel in secret.

Enciodes:
If not you, it could've been anyone else.

Enciodes:
I planned on apologizing to you after all was said and done.

Enciodes:
But now, I should probably apologize for underestimating the impact you would have.

Enciodes speaks to himself while moving a chess piece.

Enciodes:
Gnosis is my good friend, as well as my collaborator.

Enciodes:
He and I do not necessarily see eye to eye – he has his own ideas and methods.

Enciodes:
But I understand him.

Enciodes:
As long as we share the same purpose, he will not betray me, nor do I need to exchange any information with him while executing a plan.

Enciodes:
I could sit back and let him employ all his resources in whatever way he deemed efficacious to stymieing the power of the Browntail clan.

Enciodes:
Destroying the railroad tracks was just a clever trick. Gnosis gained Ratatos's trust, and also blocked access to spies and Messengers from other countries.

Enciodes looks you in the eye and makes another move.

Enciodes:
It's a draw.

As if foreshadowing the end result, Enciodes takes his hands off the pieces and spreads them out.

It means this round is over.

Enciodes:
It would appear that my luck has been quite rotten lately.

Enciodes:
I can't even win at chess anymore.

Enciodes:
Sometimes, a draw is a great victory. And other times, a draw is a crushing defeat.

Enciodes:
In my case... anything other than a great victory is a crushing defeat.

Enciodes:
But this time... is indeed an exception.

Enciodes:
Without a doubt, I have won.

Enciodes:
But what I didn't expect was that you opened up another possibility for my victory.

Enciodes:
Yes, another possibility.

Enciodes:
I thought that outcome was impossible, but you managed to see through it and influence the situation even without knowing anything.

Enciodes:
That doesn't change the fact that I won.

Enciodes:
Perhaps it's been too long since I've had a worthy opponent, but such a close match truly made my heart swell.

Enciodes:
The Saintess... does not need anyone making decisions for her.

Enciodes:
But you nudged her at just the right moment, giving her a direction.

Enciodes:
Furthermore, you set the stage for her.

Enciodes:
And you would have me believe that you did all of this unintentionally?

Enciodes:
You certainly achieved this objective.

Enciodes:
You sought out Arctosz and Ratatos, made battle predictions for them preemptively, and provided a better plan to avoid war.

Enciodes:
This very much fits your way of doing things, Doctor.

Enciodes:
Even I could not predict that this situation could be resolved in such a peaceful manner.

Enciodes:
Surely, you understand why I was so eager to unite Kjerag under one banner.

Enciodes:
That's right.

Enciodes:
I don't particularly hate the Vine-Bear Court, nor am I in any rush to eradicate religion from these lands.

Enciodes:
Nor am I particularly dissatisfied with Arctosz's insularity or Ratatos's hesitation.

Enciodes:
They don't know the things that happen outside, and thus will not hold the same views as me.

Enciodes:
If I had enough time, I wouldn't mind spending five or ten years, or even longer, changing their minds and changing Kjerag in a gentler way.

Enciodes:
But––

Enciodes:
Kjerag doesn't have enough time. Even if we cannot be considered rich, there are bound to be neighboring countries eyeing this land undisturbed by Catastrophes.

Enciodes:
I must push us forward, and if there are people who cannot accept that, then I can only deprive them of their right to object.

Enciodes:
That is all.

Enciodes:
I am simply sharing some of my thoughts with people worthy of hearing them.

Enciodes:
You saw these things as a bystander, which is the only reason I'm able to tell you this.

Enciodes:
As far as I know, Arctosz will announce his responsibility for poisoning the Great Elder and resign as head of the clan.

Enciodes:
As for why he decided to make this show of grace, he decided to make an oath with the Saintess so that the she would take control of the Paleroche lands.

Enciodes:
Perhaps to cement the Saintess's status.

Enciodes:
The Browntail clan has signed an agreement of subordination to the Silverash clan.

Enciodes:
I can share some extra details with you. I have no desire to take over the Browntail clan; should Ratatos desire, her power would not be any less than it was in the past.

Enciodes:
There are no longer any left who desire stagnation, who refuse to budge, or would fret over costs and benefits. None stand in the way of Karlan Trade and Kjerag's development.

Enciodes:
This is an outcome I can accept, Doctor.

Enciodes:
But we ended up walking separate paths.

Enciodes:
And, this is the result of my past choices. I will take responsibility for it.

Enciodes:
She, too, must bear the consequences of her choices, and lift the people of Kjerag out of this stagnation with her guidance, not my instigation.

Enciodes:
You proved yourself to me and to Kjerag, but you also... proved Enya.

Chester:
Mr. President, it's almost time for the meeting.

Enciodes:
Of course.

Enciodes:
Regardless, Kjerag is about to undergo massive changes, Doctor.

Enciodes:
Next time, it may be difficult for me to meet with you.

Enciodes:
But I can assure you that Rhodes Island is free to come and go anywhere in Kjerag.

Enciodes:
Additionally, please accept this token of my goodwill as compensation for involving you and your operators in this incident.

Enciodes:
Neither Rhodes Island's name nor yours will appear in any future official records related to this event.

Enciodes:
Also, a new contract that will allow us to call each other allies is on its way to Rhodes Island.

Enciodes:
After this is all over, I will visit Rhodes Island again.

Enciodes:
And when that time comes, I hope to play another game of chess with you, Doctor.

Enya:
Kjarr.

Kjarr:
Hm?

Enya:
You've got some guts, you know. How long have you been keeping me in the dark?!

Kjarr:
Do forgive me, Saintess, for I know not how I have sinned.

Enya:
Oh? So be it, then.

Enya:
But, Kjarr, I do have something I want to ask you.

Kjarr:
Yes, Saintess.

Enya:
...I want to know, was it Her intention for me to become the leader of Kjerag?

Enya:
Was all of this Her plan? Me feeling lost and confused throughout this entire chain of events, and then my determination when making that final choice––

Enya:
Did She expect all of that?

Kjarr understands why Enya suddenly asks that question now, of all times.

She is afraid.

She is not afraid that she made the wrong decision. But, she is afraid that everything, as far as her eyes can see, is just a game played by gods.

Kjarr:
There is but one thing I can assure you...

Kjarr:
She... has never once sought to interfere with your free will. Your thoughts have always been your own.

Kjarr:
Who is to say whether Her miracles are nothing more than the wishes and fabrications of Her faithful?

Kjarr:
Perhaps, She gave everything so that the people of wind and snow would have a pristine land to call home.

Kjarr:
She looks out over this land, searching for ways to bless the people who live here with happiness.

Kjarr:
As for the answer you gave – She acknowledges it, nothing more.

Enya:
If that's true, then can you do me a favor?

Kjarr:
Name the favor.

Enya:
Please ask Her not to take you away.

Kjarr:
...Oh?

Enya:
Isn't that what always happens in the stories? Though I've found my answer, it comes at the cost of losing you.

Enya:
I will not ask favors of Her willy-nilly, so would you continue to be my maid?

Kjarr:
...Pfft.

Kjarr:
Haha... Hahaha.

Enya:
......

Kjarr:
Sorry, sorry. I didn't expect you to make such a cute request.

Kjarr:
But... let's do this according to chapter three of the scriptures.

Kjarr:
If one day, you no longer uphold the ideals you currently do, then I will no longer stay by your side. But, until then, I swear to serve as your head maid.

Enya:
No taking that back, okay?

Kjarr:
Okay.

Gnosis:
......

Gnosis:
You want me to be your representative to Rhodes Island?

Enciodes:
That's right.

Enciodes:
You can devote yourself to your research at Rhodes Island. I trust it'll be to your liking.

Gnosis:
Did you already have that in mind when you invited them?

Enciodes:
Just another possibility.

Enciodes:
After all, regardless of whether or not our plans succeed, your situation in Kjerag is only going to get worse.

Gnosis:
You just didn't expect that the person you were trying to win over the most would almost sabotage your plan.

Enciodes:
That takes nothing from our victory.

Enciodes:
Though if you want to stay in Kjerag, I can also arrange that for you.

Gnosis:
Well, whatever.

Gnosis:
...I don't mind the infamy, but I'd get annoyed if people kept coming by to throw rocks at my lab's windows.

Gnosis:
Also, I'd like to meet this Doctor for myself.

Enciodes:
Oh, are you interested?

Gnosis:
As if. I simply want to see whether your Doctor, who has already left a mark on this land, will end up becoming our enemy.

Enciodes:
And if not?

Gnosis:
Then I'd also like to know–– what level of technical prowess a company that has succeed in suppressing Oripathy possesses.

Enciodes:
Gnosis, that gleeful hunger on your face looks about as bad as what you accused me of.

Gnosis:
......

Chester:
Gnosis, your luggage has been prepared. It's time to go.

Gnosis:
Of course.

Chester:
Shall we leave now then?

Gnosis:
......

Gnosis:
Just a moment.

Gnosis:
Monch!

Nobody responds to Gnosis's call.

Gnosis:
...Monch?

Within that plain room, everything stands in order – except the girl who always spoke with a hint of gloominess has disappeared.

He immediately spots a dagger sitting on the table in the middle of the room.

He gave that dagger to Monch.

Gnosis:
......

He remains silent for a spell, then picks up the dagger and walks out the door.

The sun is shining outside.

Ensia:
Hey Doctor, look! They've already started selling Saintess-themed goods here.

Kjerag Merchant:
My, if it isn't Lady Ensia. Welcome back to my humble shop.

Ensia:
You sure know how to keep up with the times.

Ensia:
When I came back to Kjerag, you were still selling Vine-Bear Court merch. Now you've switched to selling stuff with the Saintess on it.

Kjerag Merchant:
Hahaha, I'm not the only one. Plenty of folks all over the streets. We're even being encouraged to do business now.

Kjerag Merchant:
Now that you mention it, those things I was hawking before, I didn't actually believe in them.

Kjerag Merchant:
But when I make goods for the Saintess, I have real faith in what I'm doing.

Kjerag Merchant:
When we first heard about the transfer of power, us businessfolks were real worried about what was going to happen.

Kjerag Merchant:
But I never imagined that the Saintess would be so open-minded.

Kjerag Merchant:
Now, even the most stubborn of folk have nothing to say against dealing with foreigners.

Kjerag Merchant:
Also, I heard that Sir Enciodes plans to meet with the Saintess for discussions to fully open Browntail and Paleroche territory to the outside world.

Kjerag Merchant:
If you ask me, I'm looking forward to seeing this new day more and more.

Ensia:
Hehe.

Ensia:
I'm glad to hear you say that.

Kjerag Merchant:
You certainly ought to be!

Kjerag Merchant:
Take a look around you. Of all these people walking the street, who isn't smiling these days?

Kjerag Merchant:
Even though all that craziness happened during the ceremony, the Saintess was able to mediate the situation among the three clans.

Kjerag Merchant:
And that resulted in something most people could agree with.

Kjerag Merchant:
Y'know, I have to thank the Saintess and Sir Enciodes for all this.

Kjerag Merchant:
Oh right, were you planning on leaving Kjerag in that getup of yours?

Ensia:
Yup, my vacation's coming to an end, so it's time for me to head back to continue my treatment and work.

Kjerag Merchant:
In that case, take whatever you want! It's on me!

Kjerag Merchant:
Treat it like my parting gift to you!

Ensia:
Well...

Kjerag Merchant:
No need to be polite. You've earned it.

Ensia:
Alright, I'll take you up on it then.

Ensia:
I want this portrait of my sister, this embroidery, and that sculpture.

Ensia:
Hey, that picture––

A painting hanging on the wall catches Ensia's attention.

It's of her sister Enya and her brother Enciodes, standing at a negotiating table and shaking hands, seemingly reaching some sort of agreement.

For a moment, she pauses.

Kjerag Merchant:
Ah, this painting depicts Sir Enciodes and the Saintess reaching an agreement on Kjerag's future.

Kjerag Merchant:
Though I don't know if this scene actually happened, there's no doubt that those two are the ones governing Kjerag now...

Kjerag Merchant:
And everyone knows they're siblings.

Kjerag Merchant:
Surely, they must get along very well.

Kjerag Merchant:
Tell me, do they really?

Ensia:
Yup... Let's see if there's anything else...

Ensia:
Doctor, is there anything you want?

Ensia:
You got it!

Kjerag Merchant:
Um... Lady Ensia, I did say you could have anything you wanted for free, but please try to have some mercy...

Weiss:
......

Matterhorn:
...Doctor.

Matterhorn:
Though the two of us serve as Sir Enciodes's retainers, we are also employees of Rhodes Island.

Weiss:
We would like to apologize to you... for all sorts of things.

Matterhorn:
Courier and I will not shamelessly ask for your forgiveness. We only hope that we will be allowed to come to Rhodes Island to visit Lady Ensia in the future.

Sharp:
What do you think, Doctor?

Sharp:
This situation is indeed excusable, which I'll note in the report.

Sharp:
As for how the bosses will respond, that I cannot say.

Sharp:
Doctor, I know you don't assign any blame to them.

Sharp:
But playing dumb isn't very smart.

Sharp:
Coincidentally, you also resolved some of Enciodes's affairs.

Sharp:
If that's how you want to spin the account of what happened, then the report to Dr. Kal'tsit will take a bit of extra effort.

Sharp:
And I certainly won't help you with that.

Weiss:
Thank you... Doctor, and Captain Sharp.

Matterhorn:
Thanks again.

Aurora:
Doctor, I've already said goodbye to my folks. I'm ready to go now.

Dobermann:
Got all your stuff?

Ensia:
Instructor Dobermann!

Dobermann:
The Saintess became the de-facto leader of Kjerag, and Enciodes gained the power to leverage the majority of Kjerag's resources...

Dobermann:
Doctor, you ought to take my advice.

Dobermann:
I didn't hear your name mentioned by anyone else, fortunately. By the looks of things, you people managed to not get involved this time, at least.

Ensia:
Uhh...

Weiss:
......

Matterhorn:
......

Aurora:
......

Sharp:
......

Dobermann:
......

Dobermann:
By the looks of things, not only did you get yourselves involved, you got heavily involved.

Dobermann:
I look forward to reading your reports.

Dobermann:
Alright, if there's anything you have to say, save it for once we're on the road. Get in the car, we're heading back to Rhodes Island.

Ensia:
......

Ensia:
Doctor, do you remember that painting we saw in that store back there?

Ensia:
Mmhmm.

Ensia:
Doctor, stop playing dumb. I know you remember it.

Ensia:
Right then and there, I really wanted to buy that painting.

Ensia:
But after thinking about it some more, I decided not to. I mean, I know that never happened.

Ensia:
My brother just decided to let my sister have a move, that's all there was to it.

Ensia:
It's not your fault, Doctor.

Ensia:
Without you, the tension between those two would've only gotten more vicious.

Ensia:
But at least this helped me sort one thing out.

Ensia:
And that is – regardless of which one of them made the decision, it came as a result of their beliefs.

Ensia:
You were just a catalyst in driving things forward.

Ensia:
Just like how nobody would try to convince me to give up mountain climbing.

Ensia:
Beliefs can't be so easily changed.

Ensia:
Right.

Ensia:
But, I have another belief that won't be easily changed.

Ensia:
One day, I'm going to make sure my brother and sister get along again, like they used to.
