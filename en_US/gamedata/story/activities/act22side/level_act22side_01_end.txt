Bagpipe:
What's goin' on with these soldiers?

Bagpipe:
They go down without puttin' up a proper fight, and they don't even react to us yellin'.

Ch'en:
They're already dead. They've been dead for... over 48 hours.

Bagpipe:
Chenchen, I know you're a copper, you're not mistaken when you see things, but these people were clearly standin' before we knocked them down, right?

Ch'en:
I saw a kind of Arts, among Reunion's ranks, that could control other people.

Ch'en:
But this and that don't resemble each other. If Amiya... if Rhodes Island's Cautus was here, she might be able to feel out the difference better than me.

Ch'en:
That kind of Arts refuted emotion and thought. It took living Sarkaz warriors and wore them down into walking weapons.

Ch'en:
But these Dublinn soldiers are dead without a doubt... There's just some intense emotion that's still burning in them, even after they've died.

Bagpipe:
Burning?

Ch'en:
It's just a feeling.

Ch'en:
If this Arts had a definite form, if I used my Chi Xiao to cut through it, I'd imagine I'd be cutting through a fireball.

Bagpipe:
Wait, I've seen...

Bagpipe:
Purple flames.

Bagpipe:
Strange purple flames, burnin' in the eyes of dead soldiers...

Bagpipe:
I saw the Arts you're describin', back in County Hillock.

Bagpipe:
I haven't seen it since... not once, all this time! Chenchen, we're almost there, aren't we? That Caster leadin' the spectre force in County Hillock, she's got to be somewhere around here!

Bagpipe:
I'll never forget how she looked... I'm dead sure I'll recognize her if I see her again, and when I do, I can find out the truth about Dublinn.

Ch'en:
Right.

Bagpipe:
Come on, then! We need to keep askin' around! Villagers, maybe caravans who've passed by... We'll find them, even if they're not the spectres for real!

Fionn:
Phew.

Fionn:
Patrol came brutally fast. It's lucky we've got good eyes on us.

Selmon:
Hah, you think those Victorian eejits say hello before they come snatching?

Fionn:
You lot move ahead, I'll take a proper count. Been worried we left somebody behind in all that panic just now...

Fionn:
Oh, that's right! Where's the doctor? Did nobody fetch her?

Selmon:
Didn't she say she was off by herself this morning? I'm not minding her business.

Selmon:
Besides, it's not going to be an issue if a Viccy soldier nabs her, right? She's not wanted.

Fionn:
Look, she is! We got her involved in all this last night!

Fionn:
It was dark out and the soldiers probably didn't catch her face properly, but how many Vouivre have you ever seen around here?

Selmon:
Well, if you can't help her, what's the point dossing about fretting the whole day?

Fionn:
I...

Fionn:
Wait. Hold on, Caireann's here... Selmon, you did that on purpose.

Fionn:
You lied to her saying we'd lost track of a friend, and could she go looking...

Fionn:
Why? She was kind enough to save us, and share us some medicine... And you just left her for the army lot to snap up?

Selmon:
You don't get it? We leave her behind to attract attention, and that gives us a safe getaway for the time being.

Selmon:
And she won't say much vital even if she's caught. She doesn't even know which way we're going, let alone the fact we're looking for Dublinn.

Fionn:
But... But she could die!

Taran Refugee:
Yeah. She went off alone. She'll run into the patrol sooner or later.

Taran Refugee:
We should've taken all her luggage while we had the chance. Wouldn't fall into those Victorian scumbags' hands, at least.

Selmon:
It was her choice, Fionn. Did you not see her face when she saw me?

Selmon:
She KNEW Dublinn, but never had no kindness for it. And she spoke standard Victorian.

Selmon:
Her sort hate us more than real Victorians do.

Fionn:
I can't swallow that, Selmon. I trust my intuition for people.

Patrol Captain:
Relax, madam.

Reed:
I'm not—familiar with what's gone on here.

Patrol Captain:
I know. You're not a Dublinn ally. You just panicked for a bit, and got mixed up with those insurrectionists.

Patrol Captain:
(Taran) You've killed Dublinns.

Reed:
......

Patrol Captain:
You understood that. We're not mistaken, then. There's very few Vouivre around these parts who know Taran.

Patrol Captain:
Where did that Dublinn soldier take you lot, last night?

Reed:
No... they're not Dublinn, and they don't have anything to do with Dublinn either.

Reed:
And I've never killed anyone from Dublinn before. You've gotten something wrong.

Patrol Captain:
You can be honest here. You won't pay for it, so you don't need to fear it.

Patrol Captain:
The land around here has been under strict surveillance by the barracks. The Marquess of Trent has no plans to dither like some nobility has, letting Dublinn stir up flames all over the place.

Patrol Captain:
That's why we could even tell who you were.

Patrol Captain:
Residents of a different village, close to Trent's cityway, reported news of Dublinn to the barracks a few days ago.

Patrol Captain:
But those Dublinn soldiers, before they could attack the village, were all felled by a white-haired Vouivre.

Patrol Captain:
Would we be able to turn on the tap, so to speak? We'd like to query your identity, motive, as well as last night's arson which held similarities to Dublinn MO...

Patrol Captain:
—Hold it! Are you trying to flee?

Patrol Captain:
Stop her! This Vouivre is scared of going on record! There's something afoot with her!

Patrol Soldier:
—S-She broke my saber?! What kind of strength does she...?!

Reed:
I've told you—everything I can tell you. Let me leave...

Reed:
It'll be best for us.

Patrol Captain:
You must be of a kind with those wretches, if you're so protective of them. Bumptious Tara rabble, the lot of you.

Patrol Captain:
Fire! A few bolts aren't enough to kill a Vouivre! Suppress her first!

Reed:
Why... do you hate them so much? You're a—Taran yourself...

Patrol Captain:
Shut up! You are NOT—to address me with that word!

Reed:
......

Patrol Captain:
So anyone who spoke Taran since childhood IS a Taran? I certainly never heard of the 'Taran' people when I was young!

Patrol Captain:
If you're the one who repelled those Dublinns, you should get it into your head that 'Taran' is just an excuse of a moniker these bandits use to destroy the order. And once you do, you draw a clean line between yourself and them.

Reed:
...'It was the erosion of the Tarans by Victoria's vain stylings, that led so many to fall to banditry.'

Reed:
A mentor... told me this, many years ago.

Reed:
I'm sorry.

Patrol Captain:
Hah, hah... you're hesitating. You're scared of even stabbing people with your pike there.

Patrol Captain:
—Are you looking down on me, is that it?

Reed:
I...

It was because, in an instant, they'd become ash upon the barrens.

'The Leader':
Go, Loughshinny. If you don't want what you do to be discovered, then the best way is to dispose of all eyewitnesses.

Reed:
No, I wouldn't do that.

Patrol Captain:
Urgh—!

Patrol Soldier:
Captain!

Patrol Soldier:
Re... Retreat with the captain! Report this upstairs, request backup!

Reed:
It's okay. They won't—catch up to me.

Reed:
I'll be leaving this place very soon. I know the speed—at which the Victorian Army mobilizes.

Reed:
This is—far from wrong to do.

Reed:
—Who's there?

She thrusts her spear forth in vigilance.

—Its point hovers over some shrubbery.

Voice Behind a Shrub:
It's me, it's me...

Fionn:
It's me, I'm not going to hurt you.

Harmonie:
Yes, I'm very well aware the County Trent won't be changing its entire course just for a single order, which is why we're willing to push back the delivery date and wait for the nomadic city to come closer.

Harmonie:
Of course, only mines with royal approval could provide Originium fuel of such high purity, hence my being so very thankful for the Marquess of Trent's friendly attitude to us.

Harmonie:
I imagine we're all very happy with this business partnership.

Harmonie:
Your secretary has left with the signed contract, Mr. Hughes.

Hughes:
He'll deliver it back to the office. Please, I ask you trust him to properly handle such a vital agreement.

Harmonie:
No, no no no, I don't mean to doubt his management abilities.

Harmonie:
But rather, doesn't this imply you have more pressing matters to discuss with me personally than the contract, mmm?

Harmonie:
After all, you did choose this secluded little getaway, and dismiss your servants too.

Hughes:
Quite right, it's no surprise you'd surmise, haha. I had all these arrangements laid out specifically to convey my good faith to you. My wish is that...

Hughes:
our ensuing conversation will be founded on our mutual friendship from our time studying at the Royal Guard together, Lo—

Harmonie:
Shh.

Harmonie:
How funny you should remember that name.

Hughes:
Haha... well, you do know how famous she was at the ball.

Harmonie:
Oh, my, does it not make sense that her type could topple over and not get up while dead drunk in some godforsaken place?

Hughes:
Yes, I trust the vast majority have forgotten all about her. Whether it was a true accident or some other party's orchestration, everyone knew not to stick their noses into it.

Hughes:
I much thank you for so lavishly feigning surprise.

Harmonie:
My surprise happens to contain a kernel of sincerity.

Harmonie:
Bringing up a name vanished from the school, a name with no record anywhere in Victoria of existing... You're practically bidding 'spectres' to come.

Hughes:
Hm, you're not wrong.

Hughes:
Then let me be bold. Why, may I ask, did you contact me of your own accord? I'm no more than a minor aristocrat making minor deals with all the mercantile breadth. I couldn't do anything about the info you've hinted at.

Hughes:
Miss Informant, are you looking to circumvent your higher-ups to please your own swollen ambitions, or are you...

Harmonie:
If you've made full sense of this conversation, it wouldn't do me any more favors playing the fool, would it.

Harmonie:
The gist of it is, I'm here specifically, given our previous time studying at the Royal Guard, to offer you... and the two who've been searching for the spectre force this whole time, a little warning.

Hughes:
You knew...

Harmonie:
Mm, yes, of course I knew they came to see you, plus that you helped them pursue a batch of Originium products shipped to County Hillock half a year ago.

Harmonie:
Some people would sayyyy... you've let slip a little too much.

Hughes:
......

Hughes:
I understand how sensitive your position is, and how multifaceted your responsibilities. Rest assured, I would absolutely never leak any of this classified information to anyone.

Hughes:
As for those two rash students of mine, I'll give them a tact warning to quit while they're ahead.

Harmonie:
And I'll leave your staff a little head start on their investigation into your order's whereabouts.

Hughes:
I appreciate your kindness, but being the paltry merchant I am, I fear I shouldn't be privy to too much.

Harmonie:
No, please, drop the humbleness. After all, you're the vice-chair of your commerce coalition. I'd think the Earl that backs you would very much care about any info you gather doing business.

Harmonie:
Is the Iron Duke really so worth depending on, given his sheer silence up to now? You know, it's about time he decided where he stood.

Hughes:
—

Hughes:
Harmonie, you're not telling me you're Victoria's... no, just who are you serving—

Harmonie:
—Mr. Hughes, I'd be very happy to receive the contents of our next contract from you... sooner, rather than later.

Fionn:
Sorry, sorry... Really, I'm not here to hurt you, please don't touch me.

Fionn:
*sigh* I couldn't will myself to come out just now, sorry I didn't help you...

Fionn:
What am I on about? You're good enough with your spear there to knock a soldier out in a swing or two. Hardly needing anyone else to help you, haha.

Reed:
You should have withdrawn by now.

Fionn:
We... *sigh* Okay, you guessed as much.

Reed:
So, did they leave you behind too?

Reed:
They shouldn't... they wouldn't. You can't fight. You'd get caught.

Reed:
But you're a trader here—you know so many people. If they treat you unjustly, you have too many methods you could retaliate with...

Fionn:
No, no. I was actually... running back to bring you along, so you can flee with us.

Fionn:
I know, I'm a little late for that. I was feeling guilty, and scared of running into the army, and I just kept arguing with myself, and now I'm late.

Fionn:
It's a good thing you can fight, at least. The army can't get their hands on you.

Fionn:
Er, ma'am, sa... say something. You're frightening me, you really are.

Reed:
I am? ...Why?

Fionn:
I really don't know how to apologize to you in any way that makes it better. Honestly, they're a kind bunch usually, it's just life these days has driven us mad...

Reed:
You don't need to say anything... it's fine. I don't mind.

Reed:
Think of me like... like reeds, growing on the roadside.

I won't poison you, or crush you. At most, you'll feel a little stinging from me.

Reed:
Who would mind—such a white lie?

Fionn:
You say that with your hurt written all over your face.

Reed:
Do... I look that hurt?

Reed:
You don't need... to worry about me, but—you do need to flee, quickly.

Reed:
After last night's fire, the army will be sure to transfer more people from the city, to search the wilds here.

Fionn:
Er, right, of course...

Fionn:
*sigh* There's one more thing, actually. It's a little hard for me to say.

Fionn:
I know you're telling us to run. But for the past dozen or so days, we've been hounded by the army this way and that like beasts in a hunting ground, just going in circles over the wastes. We can't shake them.

Fionn:
So if I could ask you one more favor.

Fionn:
Please, help us. Escort us on our journey, so we can catch the carrier truck that saves our lives.
