Taran Refugee:
No, run! They're over here, too!

Taran Refugee:
Bloody hell... They've got this whole open part surrounded, don't they?

Fionn:
Erk...

Special Forces Soldier:
Freeze.

Fionn:
Okay, okay, I—I will... Bit too close with your saber there... You won't slip or anything, right?

Fionn:
......

Fionn:
R-Reed, help us! What do we do?!

Reed:
Against this many... it'll be hard to force our way out.

Taran Refugee:
Huff... huh...? Did they just break my cudgel in half?

Bagpipe:
Oof, not half bad, this lot...

Bagpipe:
I don't get it. How'd they follow us out to here? Where'd they come from...?

Bagpipe:
—Wait, that one. I've seen him before.

Bagpipe:
A couple days ago, when we ran into the spectre force...

Special Forces Captain:
......

Bagpipe:
Which means you lot aren't County Trent. These refugees are outside your jurisdiction. You've got no authority to arrest them.

Bagpipe:
We'll have to take off our gloves here, if you're not goin' to follow the rules.

Special Forces Captain:
The rules? That goes for you too. I see your piledriver spear missing its shells. You shouldn't be in a mile of the battlefield, soldier.

Bagpipe:
It's not like this was meant to be a battlefield, was it?! They've not even put the campfire out...

Reed:
—Watch out!

A black dagger slides forward without a sound. Its tip reflects not even the slightest bit of light, instead drawing a path of smoke.

The dagger points intimidatingly at Bagpipe's throat, though its bearer gives it no glance; his eyes have been focused squarely on Reed.

Reed can tell clearly, from his sharp glare, that he and the army are out for her here.

Fischer:
Isn't your pike meant to be burning with flames?

Reed:
......

Fischer:
I suggest you drop the futile resistance. Make the smart choice, lay your weapons down, and hear me out.

Fischer:
I have nothing against the Tarans, let alone any plans to retaliate against civilians. And as for steering the masses clear of ruin, you and I should be united on that front.

Fischer:
Here's the official paperwork.

Bagpipe:
What? A City Council writ of investigation?

Bagpipe:
......

The former Victorian soldier sets her weapon down.

Fischer:
Per the Council of the County of Trent's decision, I am here to investigate an overlooked, puzzling aspect of the arson cases.

Reed:
...I—have no other choice, correct?

Young Taran Refugee:
*sniffle*... *sob*...

Soldier on Guard:
—What are you doing? Quiet down.

Young Taran Refugee:
...... (Sobs)

Fionn:
......

Fionn:
(Agh, this is terrible.)

Fionn:
(Always thought I should at least get my will in order, you know, before I finally meet my maker...)

Taran Refugee:
(If you ask me? Should've written it up long ago.)

Fionn:
(I did right after we first made it out, but I tore it up, I've been so happy these past two days. Really regret that now.)

Selmon:
(Oh, shut up, Fionn. We're not done for yet.)

Fionn:
(They've got us all tied up and gagged, and everything we had to fight with got taken away. What else are we gonna do other than wait to die?)

Fionn:
(Sigh... Interrogation. Terrifying word. How many Tarans do we know made it alive out of an interrogation?)

Fionn:
(And who knows what they're prying out of a woman as kind as Reed.)

Fionn:
(We all know each other, like family we are, but we don't know Reed from a bar of soap. Don't know where she came from, don't know what she was doing before.)

Selmon:
(What, is she an enemy to you now?!)

Fionn:
(No, no, no, that's not what I meant... I just...)

Fionn:
(*sigh* Selmon. You can't just make someone not be afraid to die.)

Fionn:
(We can still see the fire from here. How long's it been since we last had the light of fire on a cold dark night?)

Fionn:
(Really thought I managed to escape, I did.)

Taran Refugee:
(You even came about borrowing some stuff to rustle up some money. Didn't I say I'd make you some smoked fowl to sell?)

Selmon:
(Enough. We need to think of something. Figure this situation out.)

Fionn:
(What? Figure this out? And what good is it gonna do us?)

Selmon:
(...I'm fed up of this, that's all.)

Selmon:
(I hate listening to how much you just sigh. Squatting about in the Taran quarter, passing by village threshing floors... it's just sighs everywhere. I'm sick of it.)

Selmon:
(Enough. Save it. Don't ask me how. You've always managed to find a way out.)

Selmon:
(I'll draw the attention of those guards. Whatever you're going to do, figure it out yourself.)

Fischer:
You can ease yourself a little, 'Reed.' We're just having an ordinary chat.

Fischer:
We have a warm fire, and we can hear the fowls chirp in the night. Surely you'd agree, this is a much more comfortable environment for conversation than a full-fledged interrogation room would be.

Reed:
......

Fischer:
No comment? That's your choice. I won't give you trouble for it.

Fischer:
Perhaps the nearby barracks' disrespect has given you cause for alarm. Allow me to apologize in their stead.

Reed:
Are you... here to investigate Dublinn? None of the people here have anything to do with them...

Fischer:
You needn't explain. As you'd expect, I already have a good grasp of the situation.

Fischer:
A singular attack has indeed spurred a minor region's barracks to take undue action against approximately a dozen Tarans, going so far as to accuse them of being part of 'Dublinn insurrectionist forces'.

Fischer:
But in the company of all else contained in this very, very heavy dossier, their mistakes aren't worthy of mention. Of course, your situation is a little different compared to anyone else's...

Fischer:
...But I believe I can do something to help you break free of these troubles.

Fischer:
After all, no stretch of your escape can have been easy.

Reed:
If... it wasn't for such harsh decrees, they would never have needed to run.

Fischer:
No, please. This is a chat between the two of us, and I'm hoping you'll tell me about yourself. About the escape you began long prior to this one.

Reed:
...I don't understand what you're talking about.

Fischer:
There are no records of any kind on you. No medical records, no nomadic city immigration records, no tax records, nothing.

Reed:
...We Tarans are driven out wherever we go. It's not strange—that you don't see me in Victoria's records.

Fischer:
Then what about the unrest in County Hillock last autumn? Were you there?

Fischer:
And what about the County Peninsula attack last May?

Fischer:
I'm asking you and you alone.

Reed:
......

Fischer:
Madam, if one does not tell anyone their birth name, where they are from, or who they are...

Fischer:
Wouldn't you say... they're just like a 'shadow?'

Bagpipe:
Chenchen, I reckon you've already figured out who these men are?

Ch'en:
Yeah. The ones that just fought us are no normal soldiers. Interrogating on the spot is very unique for procedure, too.

Ch'en:
Plus, their leader knows quite a lot. That's why he's so courteous toward us... and me in particular.

Bagpipe:
Right. I was just thinkin', they're lettin' us stand here and wait, only keepin' a couple men on watch, but the Tarans all have to have their hands bound. It's not fair...

Bagpipe:
Still, how'd he figure out who you are?

Ch'en:
...I didn't expect the Intelligence Service to work this case.

Bagpipe:
The Intelligence Service? Why would THEY be lookin' for Reed?

Ch'en:
Her background must be an unusual one.

Ch'en:
And that's why she insisted on acting alone. She didn't want to drag anyone into the mess.

Bagpipe:
Oh, I've got a bad feelin' about this... Are they actually goin' to talk, you know, to a Taran? They won't rough her up, or threaten her into sayin' somethin' against her will, right?

Ch'en:
Keep your voice down.

Ch'en:
Mm... I remember what you wrote in your report on County Hillock.

Bagpipe:
Right. He's got his writ from City Council, he says he'll keep the peace and he has nothin' against Tarans, but...

Bagpipe:
No. I should trust more. He's still an arm of City Council. He's not here to mess things up.

Ch'en:
Most people can't withstand the pressure of interrogations, though.

Ch'en:
...Do you remember how we did things, back in school when we partnered up?

Bagpipe:
Oh! Your hand signal. I do...

Bagpipe:
I remember. That's the ones we communicated with, the time we snatched those hazardous Originium products.

Ch'en:
Good thing you remember.

Ch'en:
It doesn't matter what Reed's background is. If she ends up as someone's pawn, that's going to send ripples through the status quo.

Bagpipe:
Yeah, and it'll be a nightmare on her as well... I mean, she's always seemed like she's been—tryin' to shake herself of somethin'.

Bagpipe:
I hear you loud and clear, Chenchen. We'll bring her back to Rhodes Island.

Harmonie:
Dearie, me... what pristinely clear tracks.

'The Brigadier':
It seems your opponent is extending you an invitation again.

Harmonie:
Oh, please, less ridicule.

Harmonie:
And unfortunately, I'm afraid 'invitation' is an overstatement this time. He doesn't even so much as care about what dance his guest intends on.

Harmonie:
We're making our positions plenty clear just by showing our faces.

Harmonie:
Dublinn will rescue poor Loughshinny, expose her identity... and in the end, testify as to where I really stand.

Harmonie:
And he knows. I have to wade in... so the other Draco of Tara doesn't land in his Duke's hands, and lessen The Leader's influence as a Draco herself.

'The Brigadier':
No matter. I shall wipe his ambitions clean.

Fischer:
...The fowlbeasts have stopped calling. Do you understand what that means?

Reed:
...... (Shakes head)

Fischer:
That's fine. Why don't we start with accounts of your recent incidents?

Fischer:
You haven't caused serious injury to anyone. Even the arson at the barracks resulted in no deaths nor casualties, with only some supplies lost to fire.

Fischer:
Most Tarans are driven by their hatred of the Victorians to commit graver crimes. Your methods, in contrast, have been very mild.

Fischer:
Some witnesses even attest how you tried to fend off the Dublinn soldiers.

Fischer:
Do you admit to all this?

Reed:
I can only admit—I by no means wish to harm others.

Fischer:
Good. I can believe that. You have a fair conscience in you.

Fischer:
Now, if we can turn our attention to the quietened fowlbeasts...

Fischer:
...It seems your Dublinn friends are here to save you.

Reed:
......

Reed:
No... No.

Reed:
I can't go back...

Fischer:
Go back? Oh, you mean—back to your life as a shadow?

Fischer:
Back to the kind of life surrounded by smoldering corpses, where the ashes of the dead coat the city streets?

Fischer:
To someone blessed with a conscience, it must be a very painful life.

Fischer:
But it so happens you have a chance right now. You can make your own decision.

Fischer:
Accept our protection. Your past crimes will be looked into no further.

Reed:
......

Ch'en:
Now!

Bagpipe:
Aye!

Bagpipe:
Sorry, but you'll want to try on my fortcracker for size again!

Ch'en:
—

Brandishing her piledriver spear, Bagpipe's gaze is away from the tent. Behind her stands Ch'en, and Ch'en's eyes, however, widen for an instant.

With not a sound, the tent over the interrogation turns to ashes.

A beam of flames bolts through the dark night, to then immediately vanish without a trace.
