Caravan Head:
You goddamned Tarans! Hell's bloody bells!

Caravan Head:
Cut 'em! Cut 'em down! Teach them a little lesson! Let them know never to lay hands on other people's stuff again!

Caravan Guard:
Right you are! Let's teach the Tarans a lesson!

Caravan Guard:
You hear that, you bloody rabble?

Taran Refugee:
Ugh... my arm...

Taran Refugee:
You want to put us, us Tarans... to death?

Taran Refugee:
Hah... hah... get them! We'll bash these bloody business-doers in! We'll see who it is who dies!

Taran Refugee:
Gurgh—

Ch'en:
Fall back!

Caravan Head:
Wh-What are you using the sheath for? I paid you, in cash! Shape up and act proper!

Ch'en:
The scabbard's enough. If you try anything else, I'll hold you off too.

Ch'en:
Besides, Bagpipe and I are just traveling with you. We're not your hired guards. Don't get it twisted.

Selmon:
Tch, you're monsters, you and that loon with the spear...

Selmon:
Looks like what we heard before was true. Your average caravans don't dare cross through here.

Ch'en:
So you're the leader... Your clothes are an eyesore.

Caravan Head:
Quick, Miss Ch'en, we're moving!

Selmon:
Hah, scared all of a sudden? Thought you were going to teach the Tarans a lesson?

Caravan Head:
Dublinn... spectre force, you goddamned maniacs! They were right, you run into those spectres anywhere where Tarans are!

Selmon:
That's right, you don't even need to piss us off. Just catch sight of us, and you'll be slaughtered to a man.

Ch'en:
Really?

Ch'en:
After pursuing the spectre force with my friend for this long, I've gotten an idea of how they should seem.

Selmon:
Tch.

Ch'en:
Ma'am, take your caravan out of here as fast as possible. Bagpipe and I will hold these bandits off.

Ch'en:
We'll pursue the Dublinn forces afterwards on our own. We won't be troubling you again.

Caravan Head:
Fine, fine... ugh, damn it all!

Ch'en:
Still feel like chasing?

Taran Refugee:
Rgh—! *cough* *cough*...

Taran Refugee:
...Hey, Selmon, think of something! We need to catch the bastards and do them in!

Taran Refugee:
Forget the bloody supplies... if they scarper, they'll report it to the police, and the army dossers.

Selmon:
You think I'm too thick to figure that out?

Ch'en:
You're fully aware the force you're packing can't overcome my sword. That's why just now, you tried to bluff, to scare us off.

Selmon:
...Tch.

Taran Refugee:
So what do we do now? You've got SOME plan, right?

Ch'en:
...No wonder you keep wearing this outfit, even with all the risk it brings you.

Ch'en:
You want to be this group's 'Leader'.

Taran Refugee:
Ugh...!

Bagpipe:
I only gave you a light knock. Your head'll be spinnin' for a bit, that's all. I've tested it plenty while savin' hostages—I wouldn't mess it up.

Bagpipe:
...Oh, you're out. Did I use too much strength? Or have you lot not eaten for days? Really...?

Bagpipe:
I'm sorry... but, well, it's not right to loot either.

Bagpipe:
—You're not springin' me!

The instant the pike comes out behind her, Bagpipe instinctively blocks.

Both sides fall a step back. After seeing who it is, Bagpipe's eyes widen.

Bagpipe:
—Reed?

Reed:
......

Bagpipe:
...Are your wounds okay? Are you alright? What are you doin' out here in...

Bagpipe:
Uh—wait, wait, you're part of this robbery too? I can't just let you go, then.

Reed:
...No. I wasn't in time to stop them.

Reed:
But, regardless, I don't want them to be hurt... and I don't want them to be captured, either.

Bagpipe:
Och, then we're here on about the same mission. No need to eye me that carefully, now.

Bagpipe:
Whether a Victorian serviceman or a Rhodes Island operator, we can't be harmin' civilians. Me and Chenchen were here to mediate and all.

Bagpipe:
...Um, I say that, but I'm sorry, I think my strength is a little much for the average folk...

Bagpipe:
How's about I help you carry the unconscious someplace shady to rest? Were they headed for this village?

Reed:
...Please, I beg you, leave.

Reed:
The conflict is defused.

Bagpipe:
Say it all you like, I'm still goin' to help. You've got somethin' on your mind from the looks of it, na?

Reed:
......

Bagpipe:
Ah, alright, still not keen on speakin' then.

Bagpipe:
They never let me visit you at Rhodes Island, and didn't tell me why either. Best I could guess was, you didn't want to be reminded of County Hillock.

Bagpipe:
...So what are you doin' out in these parts?

Bagpipe:
And also, you look like you've been lost in the barrens for days now. What's your mission, even? Want me and Chenchen to come with you?

Bagpipe:
Oh, there's just so much I want to ask you, my brain's goin' haywire.

Reed:
...No, it's alright. I just happened to be—invited by these people to... escort them.

Reed:
In the past, I'd operate alone in the country for very long stretches. The dangers of the wild—don't mean much to me.

Reed:
And also, I'm not here on a mission for Rhodes Island.

Reed:
...I'm pursuing some things related to Dublinn.

Bagpipe:
No wonder... Me and Chenchen are doin' the same. Must be why we ran into each other.

Bagpipe:
You were so wounded, back in County Hillock. Dublinn must weigh like nothin' else on you too...

Reed:
There was a person in Dublinn—who changed my fate, so I want to... see, if I can still recover something from there.

Reed:
Whether it relieves the pain they bring, or brings peace to myself.

Bagpipe:
...That's amazin'.

Bagpipe:
We were comin' this way with the caravan lookin' for a Dublinn unit, who'd shown up here in recent. Don't know why, but when I saw you, that gave me the shock of my life.

Bagpipe:
Thank goodness you lot and Dublinn aren't tied up.

Reed:
......

Bagpipe:
Say, I'll go have a talk with Chenchen, and we'll postpone the mission a few days. I bet she's just as willin' to help these people out.

Harmonie:
How many people did I just now have shadowing me as I entered this parlor? Take a guess?

'The Brigadier':
I have no interest in the act you put on in the midst of the Victorians and Tarans.

Harmonie:
Then I really should thank you for the pains you took, rushing here to County Trent and drawing all the attention. I thought you'd spend a lot longer harboring yourself in the army.

'The Brigadier':
With The Leader's plans progressed to this stage, there is no real difference between my identity as part of Duke of Wellington's guard, and that as an officer of Dublinn.

'The Brigadier':
Seeing as you have Caster's people surveilling you, they must have long gained possession of that information.

Harmonie:
We have little nibbles of Dublinn forces cropping up outside the cities, and the rumors of a major Dublinn force passing through... All put on show for them.

Harmonie:
Sprinkle in a few mysterious trade orders, and now even the gossiping merchants know the Iron Duke has some design or other for this city.

Harmonie:
Everyone is quietly making the rounds, frantically guessing what the Duke is borrowing Trent as a stage for.

'The Brigadier':
Very much as The Leader expected.

Harmonie:
Yes, if they'd realized our true aim too soon, and every Duke learned of The Leader's resolution in advance, I fear Oak Grove's outskirts would be in the same merry state Londinium is.

Harmonie:
Say, are they more scared of the Sarkaz, or of the Tarans?

'The Brigadier':
Trying to pit Tarans against Sarkaz? You have no right to make such jokes, Feline of Victoria.

'The Brigadier':
...I hear 'The Spy' is dead.

Harmonie:
Mmm, yes, and we've had access to far less intel from inside Londinium ever since. It really is a shame.

Harmonie:
It's not just Sarkaz in there. You have some... fairly interesting powers in hibernation.

'The Brigadier':
Your impulsiveness will ruin your plans. I've said as much before.

Harmonie:
Impulsiveness? My, scant few people would ever think THAT of me.

'The Brigadier':
You should perish thoughts of offering Mandragora survival.

'The Brigadier':
She was used by 'The Elocutionist', to try and fracture Dublinn. She was meant to die in County Hillock along with those six traitors.

Harmonie:
Mandragora was the one 'The Spy' most trusted. Executing her before confirming if 'The Spy' had turned his coat, well, that wouldn't have been the wise move.

'The Brigadier':
Excuses.

'The Brigadier':
Even if it wasn't worth myself or you in person, the task of supporting 'The Spy' should have gone to someone more dependable.

Harmonie:
Oh? Come to speak of us, you never sat well with me. Don't you find it such good news that I've never had the chance to kill you?

'The Brigadier':
Meaningless, glib blather.

Harmonie:
You can't be acting rashly before the Duke and The Leader make their final decision.

Harmonie:
If you can discern the importance of Londinium intel, then of course I can. But whether we ultimately march on Londinium or not, that's still an unknown variable.

'The Brigadier':
Hinging upon our progress collaborating with the Duke?

Harmonie:
Of course. Why else would I be so busy on my feet right now?

'The Brigadier':
...Hmph. I still remember the enclave campaign four years ago. How bitterly we awaited the result of our partnership with the nobles.

'The Brigadier':
And meanwhile, all our errant representatives were circling thousands of kilometers out, patiently pulling through several weeks just to tell the Duke one single thing.

'The Brigadier':
Harmonie, you'd best stand on The Leader's side.

Harmonie:
Or else?

'The Brigadier':
Mandragora is dead. I can stop investigating your whim to assist her.

'The Brigadier':
But she—she's still alive.

Harmonie:
Oh, you mean that dear, pitiful Loughshinny.

'The Brigadier':
We cannot have a repeat of 'The Elocutionist's' conspiracy in County Hillock. Each day she lives is a threat to Dublinn and The Leader.

'The Brigadier':
The Leader has assigned control of her whereabouts to you. Don't let personal considerations affect you any further, Harmonie. You have little leeway left to fail.

Harmonie:
Oh, you do fantasize far too much about the emotional life of a professional spy.

'The Brigadier':
......

Harmonie:
Fine, fine, you can stop boring into me with your eyes, 'Brigadier', unless you want to help by applying my makeup. I do have a dinner party to attend.

Selmon:
Not bad, Fionn. Just like back then. I always think you're a bit useless, but then every time, you get something done.

Fionn:
*sigh* What use is borrowing this bit of rations going to do?

Selmon:
Those two are Victorians, right? They say, they'll go to the city to replace anything we don't need, and sort you lot out some batons for self-defense.

Selmon:
Shouldn't you be happy about getting a decent weapon?

Selmon:
Fine, you listen to your little radio, check if they're broadcasting about merchants being looted. Maybe those cowards are scared Dublinn will get back at them. Might not even report it at all...

Selmon:
...Hey, Fionn?

Selmon:
What are you peering at back there?

Fionn:
...That Infected handful. They've been following us at a far distance since we left the village.

Selmon:
Still? Surprised they've kept up with us going so fast, and them with their sick legs and children to carry.

Fionn:
Right, it must be murder on them coming with us.

Fionn:
I... I'm worried for Moran.

Fionn:
Her eyes went bad in that famine a few years back. She can't see the way in the dark. Now with the lights-out happening, there's not even a single lamp left on.

Selmon:
Oh, no, that's sorry to hear. So, can I ask what they're doing following us? Do we look like some kind of rescue team?

Fionn:
I don't know. Er, probably it's the clothes you're wearing?

Fionn:
Look, aside from me, everyone regards you like you're a real member of Dublinn.

Fionn:
And everyone knows Dublinn's good to the Tarans. It's simple as that.

Reed:
...I'll—go and see them.

Fionn:
Oh, you made me jump... Your voice sounds a little quivery, say. You alright?

Reed:
......

Reed:
...It wouldn't be bad—to have more people standing on guard duty... It'll be easier to avoid the patrol.

Reed:
I'll... bring them with me.
