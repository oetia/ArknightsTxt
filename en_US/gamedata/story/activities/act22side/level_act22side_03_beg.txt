Plain-Dressed Bard:
History records that out of a sense the war between the Draco and Aslan had become far too protracted and bitter, the final King Gaeil signed a peace treaty.

Plain-Dressed Bard:
Legends say he opted to melt down his soldiers' weapons as a sign of his determination, but his subjects could hardly accept such a defeat. Thus they conspired to revolt, and assassinated the monarch.

Plain-Dressed Bard:
But just as you've referenced in many a speech, a single assassination is not enough to extinguish the Red Dragon's whole bloodline.

Earl of Warwick:
No matter how the Victorians write the history books, they cannot change what facts we've seen with our own eyes.

Earl of Warwick:
The Aslan promised to share Victoria's kingship with the Draco, yet didn't hand over the crown for nearly a century.

Earl of Warwick:
With the lions' ambitions so conspicuous to this point, I wonder. Six blade marks stabbed King Gaeil through. How many of them were by Aslan hands?

Earl of Warwick:
Not to mention the Draco king fleeing the royal capital after, fate unknown. And the Kingdom of Tara without its ruler was subjugated under Victorian sovereign authority, as if a matter of course.

Earl of Warwick:
I presume it wasn't his own subjects who prevented the Draco's return to the city.

Earl of Warwick:
This is why I very much enjoy your works based on the Tarans' own ballads. You've led the people to see more of history's truth.

Plain-Dressed Bard:
Thank you for your appreciation.

Plain-Dressed Bard:
To write this story, I saw plays performed in the country, and paid a visit to some wandering minstrels who'd inherited the Taran tradition.

Plain-Dressed Bard:
—But what struck me most wasn't the endangerment of Taran culture. It was how so many lives were just slipping away.

Plain-Dressed Bard:
Perhaps you believe the Tarans' ideal nation, and a border with Victoria, are necessary for the Taran people to be saved.

Plain-Dressed Bard:
But I think, if we ourselves can live better, if we can plant seeds of ideas for the many Tarans who can't read...

Plain-Dressed Bard:
Won't we have won then and there, against the Victorians who want us trapped in ignorance and poverty all our lives?

Selmon:
You want to bring that lot with you? Don't even think about it.

Selmon:
If you'll wait until they rest, if you'll share your own food with them, that I can accept.

Selmon:
But we've avoided the patrol out of pure luck the last two days. What if we don't the next time? Those kids must be seven or eight. Can't fight back with weapons, can't run fast enough. What do you do about that?

Reed:
I can fight... I'll protect them.

Reed:
You want to cross through the uninhabited region, to completely escape Trent's jurisdiction. I can aid you, the whole way.

Reed:
I contacted the organization I belong to, with the help of Bagpipe and Ch'en... my colleagues. I've confirmed the closest safehouse—is just along this way.

Reed:
If all we need is some tents, and a small amount of emergency supplies for the countryside, they can transport it over without a problem.

Reed:
And I know, the territory over there... belongs to a well-hearted Duke. Once we're there, the army won't be after you anymore, at the very least.

Selmon:
Really? There's an honest-to-God noble who'd smile on people like us?

Reed:
He has... reason to shelter the Tarans.

Selmon:
And how do you know?

Reed:
...Before long, perhaps we'll all know.

Reed:
We'll have ways to survive, bringing those people along.

Overwrought Taran Refugee:
But. Don't forget. They're Infected.

Overwrought Taran Refugee:
We've constantly been scarpering with our lives. What are we doing inviting death to our sides?

Overwrought Taran Refugee:
And we don't know when the sick'll have their flare-ups. Or when they'll just kick the bucket outright...

Overwrought Taran Refugee:
What's the point in you saving these sorts of people?

Reed:
......

Reed:
I don't know.

Reed:
I only know, that when someone saved me... I wanted to ask her the same. Why?

Reed:
Even though I was... so close to death.

Overwrought Taran Refugee:
What are you getting at?

Reed:
I'm an Infected too.

Selmon:
......

Overwrought Taran Refugee:
Wha? Oh. Er...

Overwrought Taran Refugee:
*cough*. Alright. Doesn't mean much to be Infected. Wouldn't have lived much longer than Infected ourselves without your help anyway. Haha.

Overwrought Taran Refugee:
Still...

Reed:
Oripathy won't spread just because we're in the same place.

Reed:
It's okay. You can keep a bit of distance, if you're scared. I don't mind.

Reed:
But take those Infected with you on your escape... Trust me.

Overwrought Taran Refugee:
...Fine. I trust you! Selmon. You heard what she said...

Selmon:
—I'm not fleeing.

Selmon:
If you're gonna take the ones that can't fight, take 'em. Suit your own self.

Selmon:
But my aim isn't gonna change one bit. I'm returning to Dublinn.

Solemn Officer:
...These two units have gone unaccounted for a week by now. We may surmise these circumstances relate to Dublinn, being similar to past spectre force incidents.

Biting Officer:
Similar? No, the situation we're looking at now is completely unalike.

Biting Officer:
These rebels previously would muster a single armed force to surface somewhere, launch an attack, and that was it.

Biting Officer:
Now, violence which we suspect to be Dublinn-incited is blanketing every corner of southern Victoria.

Solemn Officer:
...Is the Marquess of Trent sticking fast to his orders?

Biting Officer:
Obviously. No matter the volume of suspicious circumstances reported outside nomadic cities, we must have CLARITY on them. Get this entire region's state of affairs under control.

Solemn Officer:
But of all the small-scale conflicts, only the arson at Redridge seems truly suspect, and there was no follow-up on the fire there either.

Solemn Officer:
Maybe we should set these particular dossiers aside for now? Or should we leave them?

Fischer:
Please lend said dossiers to me, officers.

Solemn Officer:
You're... j...

Fischer:
And refrain with the greetings.

Fischer:
Also, just as before, no need to make a record of access to these dossiers.

Fischer:
This arson... may be worth a deeper investigation.

Fionn:
Have a sip of water, ould Breandán. I picked some berries too. This place can't be too far from a settlement, what with a grove this thick.

Fionn:
You want some berries too, Holly? Alright, you eat those, and then you walk on your own two legs this afternoon. Won't need anyone else carrying you, okay?

Fionn:
How about you, Moran? Wait, you don't eat stuff this sweet, do you...

Moran:
...Thank you.

Fionn:
...*sigh*.

Tempersome Taran Refugee:
Hey, how long are we stopping here for?

Fionn:
While Bagpipe and Ch'en are fetching things for us. We're all knackered as is, anyhow. Got a chance to catch our breaths.

Fionn:
Don't worry, I guarantee we'll find the closest village before lights-out.

Fionn:
We're far enough from all the trouble we made anyhow. If we hang around here and hole up for a few days, we oughtn't get caught.

Tempersome Taran Refugee:
Fine, pick me some berries too. First time seeing you happy in days.

Fionn:
Er, really? I've just been glad Reed's so reliable, and her two friends too. Kind souls, plus they can fight.

Tempersome Taran Refugee:
You sure? It's not just how your days of suffering are almost at an end?

Tempersome Taran Refugee:
We're going to keep pushing into the wastes, find Dublinn and join them. You, though, I bet you'd prefer to stay behind in village life.

Fionn:
...Er, I can't say that for sure.

Fionn:
I... *sigh* I just can't get over you lot doing things this way.

Fionn:
We were all happy just with escaping at first, the further the better. That was before we ran into Selmon.

Fionn:
She only got to persuade you all to join Dublinn once stuff got tougher on us.

Fionn:
None of you've... even seen a real Dublinn army, have you?

Bagpipe:
......

Ch'en:
Are you still thinking about Reed?

Ch'en:
She contacted Rhodes Island in full view of us after borrowing our comms equipment. Getting supplies has been smooth too. All signs indicate she's not out to trick us.

Bagpipe:
Haha, I'm not suspectin' her as much, I'm just a little concerned... Did she really make a recovery?

Bagpipe:
Granted, she's a Vouivre, but I'm still a little surprised at all the life in her... She gave my hands a right shock swingin' at me before we recognized each other.

Bagpipe:
Suppose that's a good thing, though. Just, I can't shake the feelin' there's weight on her mind. Whatever it is, she wants to do it, but it seems to hurt her so much.

Bagpipe:
Plus...

Ch'en:
Plus what?

Bagpipe:
The way she fights just seems somehow familiar.

Bagpipe:
Did I meet her, even before Outcast brought her in, back at County Hillock?

Reed:
......

Bagpipe:
Oh, aye, there you are, Reed! Perfect, me and Chenchen've been talkin'...

Ch'en:
...We're talking about which way we're heading. This route happens to take us to a nearby settlement.

Reed:
No, we can't—keep going in this direction... I'll tell the others—to stop.

Ch'en:
—

The cavalry saber concealed in the bushes snaps in two.

The one holding it doesn't shift an inch. Ch'en is sure her slash didn't harm anyone, but out from under the bush is still a hint of spilled blood. Blood deep and dark, old and dry.

Bagpipe:
Is this... dead patrol?

Bagpipe:
No, they're from the barracks. There's more over there.

Ch'en:
......

Ch'en:
Traces of bolts, sabers... and Arts.

Ch'en:
This battle probably happened a week ago. This barracks unit was ambushed, and slaughtered to a man.

Bagpipe:
Who was the enemy, then? How come they didn't leave a single corpse behind?

Reed:
They've... left.

Bagpipe:
They've all left? But with a battle this fierce, both sides should've taken equal damages, right?

Ch'en:
Bagpipe, remember the group of soldiers we discovered before encountering Reed?

Bagpipe:
Mm... they had uncanny Arts planted in them, eyes full of fire...

Bagpipe:
Reed, you were in County Hillock too. Didn't you see soldiers like that?

Reed:
...Yes, I know of them.

Reed:
They're... parted souls.

Reed:
Those with the misfortune of being deceased, yet unable to rest...

Bagpipe:
You're not sayin'—the ones who killed these soldiers are dead themselves, and they're still marchin' even after?

Bagpipe:
The traces of firefights we were chasin' before, it resembles those too.

Ch'en:
...It's the only possibility.

Bagpipe:
Chenchen, I don't know what your thoughts are, but I... I can't quite accept it, if that's what this is.

Bagpipe:
What kind of person would—keep on controllin' them, even after they're dead? That's just far too cruel.

Reed:
......

Reed:
...Selmon?

Selmon:
Like hell they're dead. You're all howling up the wrong tree.

Bagpipe:
But we saw, with our own eyes...

Selmon:
You saw something somewhere else. I only believe what I see myself.

Selmon:
Dublinn defeated a Victorian unit. They won, moved onto the next place, and now they're prepping to save more Tarans.

Selmon:
You know I'm gonna...

Reed:
...Are you worried about something?

Selmon:
Don't act like my da.

Selmon:
If Fionn's lot want to go with you, suit their own selves, but I know you're not in with us. It's those two Vouivre you're with.

Selmon:
You just want to settle us someplace, ensure we're not going to die today. You'll make us live the same old life Victoria had for us, not knowing if we'll see tomorrow.

Selmon:
And after that, you'll abandon us.

Reed:
......

Selmon:
Am I not right, 'Leader'?

Reed:
No. No, don't call me that...

Selmon:
Right. 'No.' Single word I've heard most from you so far.

Selmon:
I'm heading off now, going the way you didn't want us to go. It's only war and death, isn't it? Like the Tarans haven't seen plenty of both?

Selmon:
I don't want to hear an outsider tell me 'no' ever again.

Bagpipe:
I know she's fumin', but truth is, it's not you who's pissin' her off.

Reed:
I know.

Bagpipe:
So, are you... um, are you alright?

Reed:
I want to go with her.

Reed:
There might still be... unexploded mines, and lingering Arts, left on the battlefield. It'll be dangerous to keep—going that way.

Reed:
Can you call the rest over for me?

Ch'en:
Didn't you want these Tarans to steer clear of the battlefield?

Reed:
Mm.

Reed:
But—Selmon says, it's their choice.

Reed:
And I... I promised, I'd escort them, until...

Reed:
......

Reed:
Until I'm no longer needed.
