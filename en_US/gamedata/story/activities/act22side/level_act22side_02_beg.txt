Special Forces Captain:
Fischer, urgent correspondence from the Viscount...

Special Forces Captain:
...Fischer?

Special Forces Captain:
Oi. Pondering some question for the ages again?

Fischer:
Apologies.

Special Forces Captain:
While your mind has gone walkies taking in your jigsaw puzzle, that 'Harmonie' Feline has been continuing to act without pause, right here in County Trent.

Fischer:
I assure you, my mind has not wandered, and surveillance of her has not slackened an inch.

Special Forces Captain:
The way you act tells me the investigation's not made much headway.

Fischer:
If surveillance during this stretch proves she's still loyal to her duty to Victoria, I'll be happier than if we catch a traitor.

Special Forces Captain:
I've never seen you happy period.

Special Forces Captain:
After the failure of the last op, I thought I wouldn't see you in this office again.

Fischer:
Don't put it that way. The op itself wasn't a failure.

Special Forces Captain:
And your results from the hospital?

Fischer:
That said, I haven't reported the diagnosis to the superiors yet.

Fischer:
I consider myself as still able to assume the investigation into Harmonie, not to mention nobody would want to take over the scraps of info on this region.

Fischer:
There is a true goal behind these smokebombs, and I have a duty to find it out.

Fischer:
And I assure, I will maintain a distance from all others during this period.

Special Forces Captain:
With my experience handling emergency situations, you didn't even need to add that last part.

Special Forces Captain:
We of the Special Forces will continue supporting your investigation, as long as the city hall still lets you in.

Special Forces Captain:
Not going to say thanks?

Special Forces Captain:
Haha, never mind that. I'm just cracking a joke. Trying to untense your muscles for once.

Special Forces Captain:
Find some time to read the Viscount's letter, remember.

Fischer:
An invitation card?

Fischer:
I see.

Fionn:
Listen to you? Where are you going to take us?

Fionn:
We can't keep wandering in these wastes anymore. There's no settlements along the way you're pointing us.

Fionn:
You can forget picking berries in a place as lifeless as this, let alone hunting wild beasts. And besides, you don't know if the rain's going to pelt us with stones one day! No Catastrophe Messenger ever heads through there!

Selmon:
I know exactly how many days it takes to cross the marsh. Food-wise, we plunder a Victorian caravan and job's done.

Selmon:
Oh, and that doctor's got enough medicine for us.

Fionn:
She's not a doctor... and she's headed to a town herself. We agreed she'd part ways after escorting us to one, even. What do you take her for? A personal first-aid kit?

Fionn:
Everyone's got to throw everything they've got in with you, lives included, all because you want to be a little bit selfish, yeah? Am I wrong?

Selmon:
Shut up, Fionn! If you've got a problem, why don't you go off yourself? You think you can handle that?

Fionn:
......

Selmon:
Cowards don't survive.

Fionn:
Selmon!

Reed:
......

Selmon:
Oh, 'Reed'.

Selmon:
You know how much I hate your nickname? It's like rocks and mud, all over the ground. I don't even know if I'm talking to you or the grass we walk by, haha.

Reed:
I heard you two arguing.

Fionn:
There's... I have to tell you something. We can't go to Tulla village.

Fionn:
The airwaves just said. The army suspects two factories there of secretly producing supplies for Dublinn. They drove out a bunch of people. A whole clash sparked off.

Fionn:
We'll keep heading that direction for now. Forget catching the carrier... we'll probably get seized the moment we approach the village.

Fionn:
...*sigh* It's a miracle we got someone so capable to help us. Just barely made it out here.

Selmon:
Hah, you say that like you'll flag down a carrier and the good days'll come.

Selmon:
Escape from a factory into a mine somewhere else, until one lucky day a truck takes you somewhere other than Tara... You think that'll be a cakewalk?

Fionn:
I know of a lot who've fled that way.

Selmon:
You saw them leave, that's all. Because their village went up in smoke, because they couldn't put crops in any wasteland around. THAT'S why they left. And you don't even know where they finished up, or if they did it alive or dead.

Selmon:
And, do you even know where Tara is, or how far you go before you've escaped? They've never shown that on a map.

Fionn:
Stop trying to scare me with all these big questions! Does it make you right just because I can't answer?

Fionn:
Forget—forget it. I'll go talk with an old acquaintance here about borrowing some dry rations. *sigh* It's like all that blabbing you do's going to conjure up enough food to feed the dozen of us tomorrow.

Reed:
He's... very hurt.

Selmon:
No shit. He doesn't like telling lies, but he's got to come up with some porkies if he wants to borrow stuff. I'll be back, I can repay you, things like that.

Reed:
I'll go and help him.

Selmon:
You talk too much like those Victorian officers from other parts. They won't trust you. Or are you just that good at lying?

Reed:
I just—don't like having to rob others.

Reed:
And—I don't... like your selfishness either. It's the greatest lie of them all.

Ch'en:
You're sure your friend said he saw Dublinn around here?

Caravan Head:
Why else wouldn't we be passing through here? Word spread among all the caravans. Everyone's opting to go the long way around just to avoid this belt.

Caravan Head:
We wouldn't even have come here... if you hadn't vowed so solemnly we'd be fine.

Bagpipe:
Eh? But we're almost to your destination, and we haven't seen a thing yet.

Caravan Head:
Erm, it did happen some days ago. There's a chance they're further off by now.

Caravan Head:
What I heard was Dublinn were scrambling on their way, so much they never even turned to look properly at my friend's caravan.

Bagpipe:
Oh. How many heads did he count? Which direction were they off in?

Caravan Head:
That way. Off into uninhabited wastes. As for how many, he said he couldn't count properly, and didn't dare to either.

Caravan Head:
I've got no reason to lie to you, madams. We've got nothing to fear at all save those armed Dublinn bastards, and your average Taran hoodlums.

Caravan Head:
Poor places are always crawling with bandits or what have you. We have security measures in place, I can guarantee you that.

Caravan Head:
By the time we found out County Oak Grove was migrating far and us caravans'd have to alter course through here, I'd already spent a hefty sum arming and armoring my people.

Bagpipe:
Hold on a min, Chenchen... look over there.

Ch'en:
Huh?

Bagpipe:
There's... someone dressed a lot like Dublinn there.

Skint Farmer:
Fie, I tell you. That new tax ordinance they just announced, it's murder. None of us were so hard up in times before.

Skint Farmer:
Fionn, foreign madam, I'd love to be able to help you... but I'm living on pennies these days too, and you can laugh if you want.

Skint Farmer:
On the one hand, you want to feed a dozen or so a meal each, and that's not nothing. On the other hand, you've got all these people with working limbs and working energy. You're best off coming up with your own solution.

Fionn:
You know they've been sounding lights-out for years on the Scáthanna Fields exactly to hold off the starving, to stop us stealing some noble's prey, right?

Skint Farmer:
Faff. Who gives a toss about rules when you're starving for real? If you're just counting purely on others to help your need, I say you were born eating your head off!

Fionn:
No, no, no, never... They're all law-abiders, come on, that's why I'm even asking for a bite to eat on their behalf...

Skint Farmer:
—Maybe, I can do you something if you've got collateral.

Skint Farmer:
Sorry, Fionn, but verbal guarantees don't do no use now.

Skint Farmer:
A book? That's not gonna do it, madam. Not sure I'd even trust this to prop up my bed.

Worn Female Voice:
Hello, is anyone in?

Fionn:
Is that—

Skint Farmer:
Don't answer.

Skint Farmer:
That sick woman's here begging again. Does me in. You open the door for her, she'll be leaning on the frame talking your head off for an hour straight.

Skint Farmer:
Leaning on the frame! She's an Infected! I'm scared she's gonna have my house's doorframe growing stones!

Skint Farmer:
Faff and all, those bloody beggars. I thought last winter might well've starved them to death... Shame they caught ill, but who asked them to loiter all over pestering people?

Fionn:
One sec, though, that voice... No, it can't be? But I wouldn't mistake it...

Reed:
......

Reed:
Fionn, do you recognize her?

Fionn:
I—I don't know... *sigh* Better not peek from the window...

Reed:
Those are sounds of fighting.

Reed:
Is somebody driving those Infected away?

Skint Farmer:
No, it's from the highway, outside the village.

Skint Farmer:
Oh, God, see what I said... That's what starving people do, they start bashing other people in with hoes!

Tempersome Taran Refugee:
Stop waiting. We doss around any more and the caravan's gonna pass us.

Tempersome Taran Refugee:
I'm willing to bet Fionn's not getting us food this time. Laughing stock he makes of himself asking and asking, doesn't even realize it.

Tempersome Taran Refugee:
Those Victorians sneer at us day in, day out. What's a single bit of robbery to us or them? Weren't we gonna join Dublinn and fight the Victorians anyway?

Overwrought Taran Refugee:
But. But Reed might get angry with us. Doing something like this.

Tempersome Taran Refugee:
Let her. Shouldn't we loot while we still have the energy to fight people? You want to wait until our heads are spinning before we do it?

Tempersome Taran Refugee:
And this is the first caravan we've seen in all these days. Who knows when the next chance'll come?

Overwrought Taran Refugee:
Then. Maybe if we convince Reed to spring them with us? Then at least our chances of winning are a little better.

Selmon:
Enough, stop bringing her up. What we're doing has nothing to do with her.

Selmon:
Are you going to count on her, a foreigner, saving us forever?

Selmon:
Move. We're doing this.
