Bagpipe:
Reed, how's it goin' over there?

Reed:
Yes, no problem.

Bagpipe:
Huff—Alright! That's the last tent we've got to put up.

Taran Refugee:
Wow, you two are a powerful pair.

Taran Refugee:
Right, you were taking off, weren't you?

Bagpipe:
Aye, Chenchen and I are investigatin' those 'spectres' that were under Arts control. We've still got other assignments once everythin's done here.

Bagpipe:
This is the edge of County Trent. No barracks'll be comin' lookin' for trouble no more.

Bagpipe:
*sigh*... If only we'd been better at maintaining order. Wouldn't have had all this commotion and unjust treatment.

Taran Refugee:
Huh? What are you on about? If it weren't for all of you, there's no chance we would've made it this far.

Taran Refugee:
If this were me own home, I'd be treating all of you to a nip of elderflower liqueur tonight. I'd even be giving the stuff away.

Taran Refugee:
But most of the supplies we have on hand come from that... 'Rhodes Island' you lot're from, haha.

Taran Refugee:
If we write to Rhodes Island, will you get the message? We'll be letting you know once we're settled somewhere. If you're ever back in the area, drop by and say hi.

Bagpipe:
Eh, maybe? Once Victoria's war comes to an end, plus there's someone Chenchen should be meeting...

Bagpipe:
What about you, Reed? Where are you goin' next?

Reed:
I... I think I'll make sure everyone has settled down, before I take care of my own business.

Reed:
Even though they are away from the Scáthanna Fields, their crimes, and the hand of the lights-out bell... the Tarans still live in muddied lands, trapped where they stand.

Reed:
I think... I need to help them come up with ideas.

Reed:
I can speak both Taran and Victorian. If we enter the cities later on, we'll run into people of all kinds, and I can help negotiate... At least, I could do it more easily than others.

Bagpipe:
Oh, right, when you went lookin' for the Rhodes Island safehouse today, did you get followed by anyone?

Reed:
I don't think so...

Reed:
It's okay. Thank you for reminding me. If those soldiers are here for me... I won't be afraid.

Reed:
And also... thank you for your kindness.

Fionn:
Say, will you sell me a tent when the time comes?

Fionn:
The factories in the cities make that canvas. They don't leak water even when they get rained on for half a month. Just perfect for me to retrofit my trolley with.

Moran:
She's a fair kind-hearted one, and I'm sure you'll be fair when it comes to naming the price. I think you two'd have no trouble reaching a deal.

Fionn:
Haha, I'm joking. Where would I find the money for something this nice?

Fionn:
Who would've thought, though? We were just trying to figure out how to survive a couple days ago, but now we get to sleep in these sturdy old factory-made tents. We can even light fires at night.

Moran:
Aye. They're a capable bunch.

Fionn:
And they know Oripathy well.

Fionn:
(Whistles)

Moran:
......

Fionn:
(Incoherently rhythmic whistles)

Moran:
O, mists that shroud the valley... ♪

Fionn:
...Hide her figure waying far... ♪

Fionn:
It's a beautiful song, that.

Moran:
Out of all the people who've fancied me... you might be the only one who still remembers me.

Fionn:
Don't be saying that now... I'm certain everyone remembers.

Fionn:
This Oripathy's not your fault.

Fionn:
(Whistles slightly off-key)

Fionn:
*sigh*.

Fionn:
That lad, Selmon's brother, he's gone. That whole Dublinn squad we helped out, they might just be gone, too.

Fionn:
We did all that for nothing.

Fionn:
At least... you're still alive. You went missing for so long, but you're still alive.

Fionn:
I saw Reed handing you some medicine. Is Oripathy really curable, then?

Moran:
No, they said there's no cure for it.

Moran:
But please don't be blaming those Dublinn soldiers. I hid them in the factory's lorries, and raw Originium ore shards got in their wounds... This isn't their fault.

Fionn:
I'm not blaming. I'm just feeling awful.

Fionn:
The rest of you had faith in Dublinn, but I didn't have what it takes. Dublinn's more impressive than any of us. They've got weapons, too. But we all saw what happened to that squad in the end.

Fionn:
Dublinn treats us well and lets our Taran voices be heard, but after that? It beats me... All I remember is the blood I saw on the lorries that day.

Fionn:
Even now, Selmon still wants to find Dublinn to fight the Victorians, and I can't pull her out of it.

Fionn:
She and Reed were chatting for so long that day, say. Did Reed not talk even a little sense into her?

Moran:
I don't think it's bad that Selmon wants to do this. A colleen like her's got much to accomplish for other Tarans.

Moran:
Do you remember? Not long after I got infected myself, the entire Infected district was chased out of town.

Moran:
It was the stronger of us, after that, that took everything they could lay their hands on from the rest of us exiles. Left behind only frail pensioners and children, and the ones like me ailing badly from the sickness.

Fionn:
You should've told us sooner rather than keep it all to yourself. At the very least, it would've spared you some pain.

Moran:
To tell the truth, I can hardly remember any of it. I can't remember why no one fought back, why no one tried to protect one another.

Moran:
I always used to think that was just how life was. Doesn't matter what's in your hands when you're starving, you close your eyes and tuck in.

Moran:
Lisa died at the bottom of the mine. So did Clodagh. Has your family ever complained about working the mines?

Fionn:
Er... I couldn't say, really—maybe it's how hard it is to blame someone for it. But at the very least, I did feel... right terrible when my sisters died.

Fionn:
I wanted to find someone to talk to about it, but it was dark and suffocating at the bottom of those mines, and no one had the time to listen. I got out to peddle my wares around, and it turned out everyone had their own troubles already. No one had an ear to lend to me.

Fionn:
But hey, not too late to talk now.

Moran:
Right you are. It's not too late now.

Moran:
The wood we've gathered should be enough to last us through the night.

Fionn:
(Whistles) ...Let's go, then. Won't be so easy for you to tell the way once the sun comes down.

Taran Refugee:
Hey, the pot's bubbling. Can I have a bite now?

Selmon:
Settle down there, you cottonhead! Did you not ever cook supper back home?

Selmon:
Wait inside the tent. Once the meat's done, give me a hand bringing it over.

Ch'en:
She seems to be in a better mood.

Reed:
Yes... but I'm sure she's still grieving.

Ch'en:
It's a good thing you killed her heart for Dublinn, at the very least.

Reed:
...You knew?

Ch'en:
And I imagine with you here, they won't stray onto the wrong path.

Ch'en:
Though it'll be hard for you to keep walking with them, Draco.

Reed:
......

Ch'en:
I'm not wrong when it comes to these things.

Taran Refugee:
Don't be daft, Fergal, you played King Gaeil's warrior in last year's play. Three times you fell with 'mortal wounds', three times you had to clamber back up. Your arms and legs were all bruised by the end.

Taran Refugee:
Then I'll make him invincible this year. Every year, King Gaeil loses in battle, Gastrell dies at the bottom of the castle. Other than the costumes, we never try anything new.

Taran Refugee:
Hey, Selmon, c'mere. Have a seat. I've been thinking you could take on the role of King Gaeil's left-hand man, the general, this year. Yeah, you're a bit young, but there's not one of us with more fire in their belly than you.

Selmon:
What?

Taran Refugee:
You're only saying that 'cause you saw the pot she's bringing over. Look, she doesn't want to.

Selmon:
No, what are you talking about? I don't know who that is.

Taran Refugee:
Eh? Don't they put on those plays every summer over by yours? We're trying to sort out who'll be playing which role.

Selmon:
Mmm... is that where someone calls herself the goddess of the river and splashes the audience at the end? That whole thing?

Selmon:
I've seen it... but I'm not interested. Not unless I'm playing her.

Taran Refugee:
That's her mourning the dead soldiers. Her lines are harder to remember than any other role.

Selmon:
Oh.

Taran Refugee:
We might not finish building the theater before the end of the summer, though. You could have till next year to prepare.

Selmon:
Right... who knows.

Taran Refugee:
Looks like you still want to go after Dublinn?

Selmon:
Of course. You think I'm just going to give up like the rest of you?

Selmon:
I made my decision after talking to Reed that day.

Selmon:
I still believe it. Dublinn's dream can be realized, and someone has to realize it.

Reed:
...What is it you want to find out from me?

Ch'en:
I have nothing to ask. I've seen what you've done for myself.

Ch'en:
I trust the judgments I make seeing what I do, and I trust Rhodes Island's judgment.

Ch'en:
But right now, in the eyes of most Victorians, there is only one Draco still alive.

Ch'en:
Dublinn's Red Dragon, the descendant of the Taran king. More than enough to fill the dukes with their sinister ambitions and the nobles with anxiety.

Ch'en:
It must be difficult for you.

Reed:
Does... she know my identity, then?

Ch'en:
Bagpipe?

Ch'en:
She is actually very smart, and attentive, but there's a great deal she doesn't like to think negatively about—especially not friends she approves of.

Reed:
......

Ch'en:
If we continue our journey together, that's something that both you and her will have to face eventually.

Reed:
Are you... advising me to leave as soon as I can?

Ch'en:
What's done can't be undone. You can't run from the responsibilities you have to bear.

Ch'en:
But I think that, to some people, whether you are a Draco or not doesn't actually matter so much.

Yes. It sounds like... it's about wine, and the uplands in summer. I've never heard it before... but it's beautiful.

Bagpipe:
Chenchen, you're finally back! Here, look at this! Mr. Odhrán can whistle with a blade of grass!

Taran Refugee:
(Whistles sharply)

Taran Refugee:
Haha, my pitch can be pretty off. My da was really good at it, though. I picked up a bit here and there from him.

Bagpipe:
Hmm—hm-hmm—

Bagpipe:
Oh, you don't mind if I sing along a little, do you?

Taran Refugee:
Go ahead! It's our drinking song. Only thing I'll take offense to is an empty bottle, haha.

Bagpipe:
What's the lyrics, then? Is it okay if I sing in Victorian?

Taran Refugee:
Hm... Let me fetch someone else. You just listen to them.

Taran Refugee:
Fionn, you're up.

Wow, that bread smells good...

Young Refugee:
You can have half!

Bagpipe:
Oh, ta! Here, Chenchen, you have a bite. Come on, just one.

Bagpipe:
Lush, isn't it? I wonder what herbs they're usin'...

Ch'en:
Hmm... Can't tell.

Bagpipe:
Eh? You spent ages back in Yan. What, did your taste buds get more fussy, or just duller a bit?

Ch'en:
What do you think? We Lungmenites brew our tea in the summer with twenty-four kinds of medicinal herbs.

Bagpipe:
Really...? Oh, you're pullin' my leg again, aren't you?

Ch'en:
I'm not.

Ch'en:

Reed:

Ch'en:
This is how their lives could've been all along. A bit better than this too, of course.

Ch'en:
You gave them their lives back.

Taran Refugee:
Reed, you know Taran. No excuses from you. Sing!

Reed:
...Eh?

Taran Refugee:
(Teasing whistle) Sing.

Reed:

Taran Refugee:
Right you are. I remember taking my sister around—she wasn't so sick that she couldn't walk yet. We were stood on the stone bridge, listening for a good while.

Taran Refugee:
*sigh* There must be more bridges like that, right? With just how far the Camai flows.

Fischer:
Bring the civilians under control first, but don't let any of them get hurt.

Fischer:
Our target possesses excellent military accomplishments. Avoid direct confrontation to all possible extents.

Taran Refugee:
Selmon, look. How's this for defensive posture? Learned it from you.

Selmon:
So? You'll just be chasing fowlbeasts from now on. What'd you learn that for?

Fischer:
Do not talk to any of them. Not even a single word.

Fischer:
Leave the rest to me.

Ch'en:
Don't forget, we need to be out of here before daybreak.

Crossbows at the ready. Prepare smoke grenades.
