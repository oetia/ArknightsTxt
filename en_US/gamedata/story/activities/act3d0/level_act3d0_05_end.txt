Ceylon:
Schwarz, the years I spent studying in Victoria weren't just for show.

Ceylon:
There, I studied the most cutting-edge science and technology pertaining to Catastrophe and Originium research.

Ceylon:
Things that seem to fall within the realm of the divine to you, may well be a fact of reality for me.

Ceylon:
Everything that I've learned, as well as everything I believe in, tells me that I am right.

Schwarz:
Milady, you did not go to law school.

Ceylon:
Huh...?

Schwarz:
What is Rhodes Island trying to do at the City Hall?

Ceylon:
Searching for evidence to use against Cronin.

Schwarz:
Hmm?

Ceylon:
Cronin may be slimy, but he's not stupid.

Ceylon:
He's a Catastrophe Messenger. There's no way he doesn't know about the volcano's situation.

Ceylon:
I'm sure he's hiding the truth for his own benefit, and as long as we can gather the evidence secretly...

Schwarz:
I think Rhodes Island will confront him directly, so that whole secret search is unlikely to succeed.

Ceylon:
...

Ceylon:
It-it's fine! Since you're not there...

Schwarz:
Milady, I want to know why you're doing this. If you give me a reasonable answer, I won't go after Rhodes Island.

Ceylon:
...This is something I have to do. I don't believe that my father is such a cold-blooded person. He would never stand by idly and let this happen.

Ceylon:
My father loves this city more than anyone else. And I know that better than anyone else.

Schwarz:
Do you still hate him?

Ceylon:
Why would I? If anything, he should be the one who hates me, because my birth took my mother's life...

Ceylon:
But he never resented me.

Ceylon:
What I hate is how he arranges everything for me and never tells me what he's planning.

Ceylon:
It may seem like he's protecting me, but the end result is that I only end up ignorant and helpless.

Ceylon:
Just like right now! It must be Cronin's fault; he must have hidden the truth about the eruption from my father.

Ceylon:
That's the only reason he ordered Cronin to stop me! Would you call that hate?

Schwarz:
Eruption?

Schwarz:
What Cronin said was, you were going to reveal Master Doykos's secrets, so that he would be dismissed and put on trial.

Ceylon:
What?! No, what did my father even do in the past?

Schwarz:
Don't worry about it.

Schwarz:
...Hmm, I see what is going on now.

Ceylon:
So Cronin wasn't even under my father's orders when he tried to capture me. Phew, that about clears things up.

Ceylon:
Schwarz, if I really wanted to do something like that, I would have gone through legal channels.

Ceylon:
Everything that I'm doing is also for the sake of this city, my hometown.

Schwarz:
I understand. Milady, you're not concerned about the past, or about social standings.

Schwarz:
I feel the same way as you. As does your father.

Ceylon:
Phew... No matter what others think, I'll always trust you and my father.

Ceylon:
Even if there's a conflict between our goals, I trust that we'll be able to resolve things between the two of us.

Ceylon:
That's why I believed that you'd be here. We both understand this city well.

Ceylon:
That's why you'd come to stop me.

Ceylon:
Come to think of it, it doesn't really matter who the mayor is, right? I'm sure that's what my father would think. What he cares about is this city.

Ceylon:
That's why I know he'll agree with me.

Ceylon:
Schwarz... wouldn't you agree?

Schwarz:
You've grown, milady.
