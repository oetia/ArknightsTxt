Ceylon:
Cross Civic Square, and the highest building over there is the City Hall.

D.D.D.:
What's up, everyone!! Thank you all for coming out here! This is... D— D— D——!

Audience:
(Thunderous cheering)

D.D.D.:
We're all gathered here on this scorching summer day for the same purpose... and that is—

Audience:
MUSIC!

D.D.D.:
What was that? I couldn't hear you! Gimme your loudest voice, and let the whole city know what you want!!

Audience:
M U S I C ! ! ! !

D.D.D.:
In that case... put your hands up! Let's go!!

Ceylon:
This is an everyday occurrence during the Obsidian Festival. After all, the concerts are one of the most beloved things about the Festival.

Ceylon:
The major concert starts at night in Garrison Amusement Park, while at daytime, you can see small concerts in every district.

Ceylon:
Haha, but you know what, I studied in Victoria, so I prefer more elegant music and classical.

Ceylon:
Even though classical artists are invited to the Obsidian Festival, this kind of music is more attractive to the tourists.

Ceylon:
It started trending the last few years or so. When I was younger, jazz was all the rage.

Ceylon:
I love spending the day on 2nd Avenue. With a few books with me, I can stay an entire day in one of the cafés.

Ceylon:
Listening to music, having  a cup of green tea, and enjoying the sea breeze...

Ceylon:
It was then that I thought, Siesta must be the best city in the world.

Ceylon:
Of course! This is all possible due to the support I have, including from my family.

Ceylon:
Besides my father, someone close to me works at the City Hall here.

Ceylon:
You'll meet her soon. With her help, it will be much easier to determine how serious the problem is!

Ceylon:
My mother died when she gave birth to me. After that, my father buried himself in his work.

Ceylon:
Since I was little, she has been taking care of me as my bodyguard. Her name is Schwarz.

Ceylon:
Whenever my father was busy with work, she patiently kept my company. Though we're not related by blood, she treats me just like a sister would, so I consider her to be an important part of my family.

Ceylon:
I'll introduce you to her when we meet.

Ceylon:
Look, Doctor, we're almost there. Let's head straight in.

Bodyguard:
Mister Cronin, Miss Ceylon would like to see you.

???:
......

Cronin:
What important matters bring you to the City Hall, milady?

Cronin:
Everyone is busy organizing the festival right now, so I'm afraid there is little time to spare.

Ceylon:
Cronin, I'll get to the point. The Siesta Volcano is likely to erupt soon. I can't say exactly when, but it could be as soon as the next few days.

Ceylon:
In other words, all the citizens and tourists will be in danger. We need to start evacuating them and help them find shelter.

Ceylon:
We must stop the Obsidian Festival right away.

Cronin:
Oh milady, do you know what you're saying?

Cronin:
Anyone else would have been driven out the moment they talked to me like that.

Cronin:
But because you're special, I'm willing to explain it just for you.

Cronin:
You don't have to worry about the volcano 'issue' at all. Even though I don't know where you got your information, I can assure you that it's nonsense.

Ceylon:
...Are you kidding me?

Ceylon:
There's plenty of evidence that suggests that the volcano is active again and will likely erupt soon.

Cronin:
Such as?

Ceylon:
Agitation of the Originium slugs living there, unusual changes in temperature, and a strange smell. The conclusion should be obvious.

Ceylon:
If you don't believe me, read the material I brought. It contains a detailed analysis and the conclusion.

Cronin:
Obvious? Did you go interview the Originium slugs? Or maybe the hot air, or that strange smell?

Cronin:
I don't quite understand. What do these baseless numbers have to do with this so-called imminent eruption?

Cronin:
All I know is, I designed the volcano observation system, the mayor built it, and it is still working well.

Cronin:
Right now, the Siesta Volcano's parameters aren't much different from previous years. If anything, they're even more stable?

Ceylon:
What are you talking about? The truth is right before you...

Cronin:
And who exactly are you?

Ceylon:
Dr. {@nickname} is from a professional organization, with colleagues who are experts in volcanology.

Ceylon:
These parameters were examined by the analysts from their specialized department.

Cronin:
I see, I see.

Cronin:
...Haha, I get it now.

Cronin:
So it was you bunch who managed to fool the mayor's daughter, strange visitors.

Ceylon:
What are you talking about?

Cronin:
Milady, isn't it obvious? You were duped by this faceless stranger.

Ceylon:
Cronin, what are you trying to say? You don't even believe my word?!

Cronin:
What I'm saying is, you've been studying abroad so you might not know this, but many people are jealous of Siesta's development.

Cronin:
These kinds of people appear every year. They've tried every trick in the book to try to stop our development. Blackmail, explosions, assassinations. They've even targeted no-name people like me.

Cronin:
Of course, this is not the first time that someone has tried to spread rumors about this so-called 'volcanic eruption.' However, it is the first time one of these rumors has even been able to deceive someone like you.

Cronin:
I must say, these grifters must have done their homework on the mayor. They even knew that you just returned from studying abroad.

Cronin:
And look at their nerve, marching into the City Hall like they own the place.

Ceylon:
...You're right that I didn't know about this, but I'm telling the truth!

Ceylon:
There's no way I'd just trust any stranger who shows up!

Cronin:
As far as I can tell, there's no difference between this 'Doctor' and the swindlers I've encountered in the past.

Cronin:
There's no depths to which they won't stoop in order to take away this city!

Cronin:
Jumping to conclusions? Hah, that's what all you swindlers say.

Cronin:
What a coincidence. I didn't find your little joke funny either.

Cronin:
Milady, you're still young, so things like this are bound to happen sometimes.

Cronin:
But don't worry, these swindlers will be punished accordingly. This, I promise you.

Cronin:
Security.

Cronin:
Take them away.

Bodyguard:
Yes, sir.

Ceylon:
Cronin! You won't even listen to me now?

Ceylon:
You won't have your way as long as I'm here!

Cronin:
What a pity then. I can't just stand by and watch you disturb Siesta's order.

Cronin:
Hurry and arrest these con-artists already.

Cronin:
Also, suppress Miss Ceylon as well. Don't hurt her though; just let her calm down a little!
