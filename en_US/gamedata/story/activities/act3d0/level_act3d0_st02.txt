Eyjafjalla:
Finally, through comparing isotopes and analyzing various samples, we've basically been able to confirm your hypothesis.

Eyjafjalla:
The frequency of volcanic activity has, without a doubt, been rising abnormally. Though there's no imminent danger of a Catastrophe, we cannot ignore the danger.

Eyjafjalla:
In two to four weeks, the volcanic activity will reach a critical point. Expect a Catastrophe to occur at that point.

Eyjafjalla:
If possible, I would recommend beginning evacuation efforts as soon as possible.

Eyjafjalla:
...To summarize, that's the conclusion I've drawn from the information you provided me.

Provence:
That's Eyjafjalla for you. She can even give a 40-minute lecture over the phone.

Provence:
Doctor, did you understand all that?

Provence:
That's what I thought as well. Before I could react, it was already over.

Provence:
Wow, that's amazing, Doctor. I couldn't understand her at all...

Provence:
Seeing those two over there, I thought I was the only one who wasn't getting it.

Skyfire:
As expected of Eyjafjalla. Even I felt like I was just put through a seminar.

Ceylon:
I see, so that's a true professional. I never knew the data could be analyzed like that.

Ceylon:
I didn't expect to be presented with such a good learning experience. Jeez, I should have written it all down!

Eyjafjalla:
Even though the information we have right now is far from comprehensive, I've reached the same conclusion as you have. The volcano has most likely become active once more.

Eyjafjalla:
Unfortunately, I can't be there to further delve into why it has become active.

Eyjafjalla:
...Sorry. If we had a bit more on-site information, we'd be able to better predict the activity cycle.

Eyjafjalla:
That way, we'd be able to evacuate the citizens more easily.

Provence:
We all know that you're passionate about volcanoes, Eyjafjalla.

Provence:
You've already been a great help. Thank you very much.

Ceylon:
I'm glad I had such a professional team like yours to help me confirm my findings.

Ceylon:
Something might be wrong with the detector in the monitoring station. It hasn't detected any abnormal readings so far.

Ceylon:
By the looks of things, my efforts were worth it.

Ceylon:
We've got to send news of this to the City Council. Otherwise, the results could be devastating.

Skyfire:
You're telling me that Siesta didn't even make any emergency plans for a possible Catastrophe before hosting such a large-scale event?

Ceylon:
The people here probably haven't even considered the possibility of a Catastrophe, let alone made preparations for it.

Ceylon:
My father went to the new development zone to conduct business about three months ago, and won't be back for a few more days. Now, his secretary, Cronin, is responsible for everything.

Ceylon:
Cronin is also this city's Catastrophe Messenger. When we take the data and the samples down to the City Hall, he'll be able to understand the situation.

Ceylon:
Even though I'm the mayor's daughter, I rarely get involved in the government's affairs.

Ceylon:
But now that we have definitive proof, I might be able to get some help from the family.

Provence:
Doctor, I have an idea. I want to head to the volcano again to check on that reason that Eyjafjalla mentioned.

Provence:
Can you help Ceylon out while I'm gone?

Provence:
Catastrophe Messengers always put their lives on the line for their work, so don't worry. I have plenty of experience with this kind of stuff.

Provence:
Although I'll only be able to call you from the hotel, I'll be sure to stay connected with the Doctor.

Skyfire:
I'll also come with you.

Provence:
Huh?

Skyfire:
Got a problem with that? I can't just let you go alone. What if you ruin all the precious data?

Skyfire:
Of course I have to go with you.

Provence:
Um, all right, all right.

Provence:
By the way, do we need to notify Amiya first?

Skyfire:
Nah, it's fine. It's not that serious. As long as the Doctor knows about it, we're good.

Ceylon:
So if that's all settled, let's get going, Doctor. Please prepare everything you need, and we'll head for the City Hall at 2 P.M.

Ceylon:
Phew, that about wraps things up. I suppose I can finally relax a bit.

Ceylon:
Doctor, here's some tea I brought back from Victoria. Would you like a cup?

Ceylon:
I think you'll enjoy it.

Ceylon:
Do you not know how to make tea? I'll help you then.

Ceylon:
Mhm, I just know you'll like it.

Ceylon:
You're a really difficult person, you know.

Ceylon:
I'll have you know that this is one of the highest-grade teas in Victoria!

Ceylon:
There you go. You'll definitely like it.

Ceylon:
I make really good tea. You'll regret it your whole life if you miss this chance.

Ceylon:
How stubborn. I had to say all that just to make you try it.

Ceylon:
All right, just wait a moment.
