(Ring ring ring! Ring ring ring!)

(The alarm was followed by a cacophonous banging of the drum kit.)

AaaaAAAaaaaAHH~â™ª

Manager:
Get up already!

D.D.D.:
Urgh... Gah!

D.D.D.:
M-Man... things got gnarly last night! Gimme a few more minutes...

D.D.D.:
Phew, nothing like a cold shower to start the day! I have a feeling that it's gonna be a great day!

Manager:
Drink the vegetable juice. I told room service to put it in the fridge.

D.D.D.:
Those aren't even fit for consumption!

Manager:
Don't act like I don't know. You screamed for like two whole minutes during last night's show, right?

D.D.D.:
Y-yeah.

Manager:
Even though you're not a singer, you need to take better care of your throat. But last night's performance was a huge success. Congratulations.

D.D.D.:
Hmm, I don't know about that.

D.D.D.:
I've tried, but no matter how much effort I put into it, I feel like I won't ever be able to do better than D.litHun.

Manager:
You've already done very well.

D.D.D.:
Is that so? Well... It's no big deal. I've made up my mind. For the next collab album, I want to make four more remixes for our demo so our partners can have more tracks to choose from.

Manager:
Four more demos?! You've already made 26 mixes the last few days. I know you see it as practice, but you can't push yourself like that!

D.D.D.:
It's fine. I had some new ideas during the show last night. I want to try taking them in some new directions.

D.D.D.:
I've just about figured out my limits. Now that I have a better understanding, I'll just have to keep pushing my limits further. That's what improvement is.

Manager:
But what about the concerts? Your schedule is full until next year!

D.D.D.:
Not a problem! I have whole 'nother stamina bar for that!

Manager:
I don't even know what you're talking about now!

D.D.D.:
Oh come on, we've worked with each other for so long. Do I ever make mistakes?

Manager:
You blew out all the lights in the studio last time!

D.D.D.:
That was a problem with Arts, not with the music!

D.D.D.:
But, you did just remind me of something.

D.D.D.:
If that theory is correct, my ideas and my musicality... can definitely be taken to another level.

Manager:
...The relationship between Originium Arts and music is still just a hypothesis. Don't let that lead you around by the nose.

D.D.D.:
Huh? Do I even have a nose?

Manager:
You should have figured that out long ago without needing to ask me!

D.D.D.:
But, the Leithanians did it.

Manager:
...

D.D.D.:
Notes, melodies, form, structure. Everything is composed the same way one would write Originium Arts.

D.D.D.:
Gaaah! It's just too profound! It doesn't feel like the way I'd do things!

Manager:
If you've already realized that, then I can rest easy.

D.D.D.:
Perhaps I do need to kick back and relax a bit.

Manager:
Good, don't push yourself too hard.

Manager:
But wait, don't cause another blackout in the district again!

D.D.D.:
Jeez, I won't! I'll keep things under control this time.

D.D.D.:
Oh, that reminds me, I met that Cronin person you were talking about.

Manager:
What'd you think about him?

D.D.D.:
To be honest... I don't think he'd be a very good sponsor. He seemed like the kind of person who cares too much about money.

Manager:
I had the same feeling the last time I saw the contract... But it's fine, Siren gets to decide our sponsors anyway. I know you're a good judge of character.

Manager:
Be careful out there. Some say that Siesta is a lot more complicated than it looks. Also, don't use that Grace account for now.

D.D.D.:
Don't worry. I said I'd keep things under control. This is my greatest secret after all!

Manager:
Your little underground organization, huh?

D.D.D.:
Musicians always need their own space!

D.D.D.:
Hmm? A message... Good thing Siesta really is a city built for tourists - the network sure is fast here.

D.D.D.:
Hmm, who's on this channel?

D.D.D.:
'From Ada.Closure.Church.' ...Wait, it's Closure?

D.D.D.:
'I heard the festival was a great success. Congrats :P'

'Long time no see, Grace. Are you still in touch with Dijkstra? Let's find a chance to get him and do something great together next time!'

'Oh right, make sure to take care of yourself :3'

D.D.D.:
God...

D.D.D.:
I knew today was gonna be awesome!
