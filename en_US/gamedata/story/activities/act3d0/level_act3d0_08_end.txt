Ceylon:
Watch out!

Provence:
Haah!

Skyfire:
Hyah!

Ceylon:
Is it really getting weaker? I can't tell from the appearance at all!

Skyfire:
Watch out for the lava! Just how much obsidian has this thing absorbed?!

Giant Originium Slug:
GROOOAAAAARRRRR!!!

Provence:
Poor thing... But we can't afford to show it any mercy! Skyfire!

Skyfire:
All right, I got it! Time to go all out!

Skyfire:
Well then, how do you like the taste of this?!

Giant Originium Slug:
Grooooooarrr!!

Ceylon:
It's becoming enraged...! I'll block its way. The rest of you, focus on attacking!

Skyfire:
Big tail!!

Provence:
I finally managed to land a hit through a crack in the lava, but I can't guarantee that it's going to work on something of this size!

Giant Originium Slug:
——————!!

Skyfire:
We did it! It's heading the other way!

Provence:
Yes! The citizens are going to be safe now!

Skyfire:
Good grief! I can't believe a single slug would be that hard to deal with! My skirt is all ruined...

Provence:
It was the leader of the colony after all.

Provence:
If people didn't destroy their habitat in the first place, then perhaps...

Skyfire:
I'm exhausted! Let's not bring up that tiresome topic again!

Ceylon:
Haha, me too. I'm so tired I can barely stand.

Ceylon:
But, we have to head back to Siesta. There are people waiting for us there...

Ceylon:
Oof!

Provence:
That's understandable, but a mature lady should also learn to get help if she's not even able to keep her balance.

Ceylon:
Th-thank you...

Skyfire:
All right, let's go take our victory lap now. Once we get back, there might still be some time for us to enjoy our vacation.

Provence:
But... sooner or later, this place will...

Skyfire:
Big tail?

Provence:
Ah, I'm coming.

Provence:
Skyfire...

Skyfire:
I know.

Skyfire:
But we should respect the city's choice, and let them handle the rest, right?
