Amiya:
Doctor, I have to blame you for what happened this time.

Amiya:
Everyone has been injured to some degree. As the leader, you're responsible for that!

Amiya:
Gummy has already finished treating them, but it's going to sting if they get in the water.

Amiya:
Jeez, you need to show some more reservation when leading your teams.

Amiya:
Um, it's not like I'm trying to trample on your good will...

Amiya:
Is, is that so? Miss Savage picked it out for me... I was so worried that you wouldn't like it--

Amiya:
W-wait! Don't you try to play that trick on me, Dr. {@nickname}!

Amiya:
Good grief... And I have a word for Mister Hellagur as well!

Amiya:
I explicitly told him to keep an eye on you, so why did he turn a blind eye...

Amiya:
Until a contract is signed, Rhodes Island is not allowed to intervene in the internal affairs of an independent city-state.

Amiya:
If we get caught up in legal repercussions, Rhodes Island will be in a very tight spot.

Amiya:
Yes, I know.

Amiya:
Doctor, you really did something very dangerous.

Amiya:
...Why were you fighting with crazed fans anyway! If you're an adult, you should act like one.

Amiya:
No matter how much you like a band, you need to be nice to the other audience members, and you certainly can't pick fights with them!

Amiya:
(Shush!)

Amiya:
No more questions! That wraps up this incident! Okay!

Amiya:
Be more careful next time, okay?

Amiya:
All right!

Amiya:
Doctor, come with me. I found lots of beautiful seashells on the other side of this reef. Beaches are absolutely fascinating!

Amiya:
The water isn't cold... Hmm...

Amiya:
Come, Doctor, it's over here!

Amiya:
Eek! Doctor! Please don't do that!

Amiya:
Darn it! Take this! Ahaha...

Amiya:
Ehehe...

Herman:
Dr. {@nickname}, nice to see you.

Herman:
Ceylon told me many things about Rhodes Island, so I've been very keen on speaking with you.

Herman:
How about taking a walk with me?

Herman:
Thank you, Doctor of Rhodes Island.

Herman:
Had you not helped my daughter, her recklessness would have ended dismally.

Herman:
I trained Cronin myself. His instincts may be base, but he's also very capable. That's why I turned a blind eye on him all these years.

Herman:
However, as of the last few years, he's gone down a dangerous road, and I can no longer trust him.

Herman:
This time, I left Schwarz here on purpose just to see if he's still trustworthy.

Herman:
The results were disappointing.

Herman:
...I enjoy walking along this part of the beach.

Herman:
That's because my wife, Barbara, sleeps deep beneath these waves.

Herman:
I still remember that day; the weather was a bit warm, and the sunset was splendid. She turned to me here and said, 'If only we could stay here forever.'

Herman:
In the blink of an eye, I was left behind.

Herman:
Doctor, turn around and take a look.

Herman:
Do you understand now? This city is a paradise I built for her.

Herman:
As for why I'm telling you this...

Herman:
Because I can tell that you and I are the same type of person.

Herman:
In this world, not everything can be resolved with good. Sometimes, we must get our hands dirty.

Herman:
For me, good and bad lost their meaning a long time ago. The only things that matter to me are results, and this city.

Herman:
I'm not looking for understanding, Doctor.

Herman:
If I needed my daughter's understanding, we would not have become like we are now.

Herman:
Besides, do you think she'd really understand if I told her?

Herman:
No. She still needs a long time to understand that the world isn't as black and white as she thinks.

Herman:
Schwarz hopes that she will never understand, but I... Unfortunately, I lost the ability to make that choice.

Herman:
Doctor, Ceylon would like to join you, so I asked Schwarz to accompany her. I'm fine with it.

Herman:
After all, this Siesta is no longer her paradise.

Herman:
I've seen the new geological report. Sooner or later, Siesta will be consumed by the magma.

Herman:
We've managed to postpone that day's coming. I am grateful for the effort that you've all put forth today.

Herman:
Over the years, I've been looking for a solution to this matter. I have found it, but the price is almost as great.

Herman:
The new development zone I've been working on will become a brand new mobile city. By the looks of things, it will become the next Siesta.

Herman:
I'm deeply attached to this place, but that doesn't mean that I can ignore the volcano that slumbers fitfully beside me.

Herman:
After the end of this Obsidian Festival, we will begin moving into the new mobile city. As for Siesta, we will let her rest until the magma reclaims her.

Herman:
I heard that this ocean is bounded by land. Some have told me that this isn't a real ocean. It may be wide, but it's not boundless.

Herman:
In that case, we will continue to follow the coast. Perhaps one day, we will finally return to our starting point, the real starting point.

Herman:
However, by that time, this beautiful beach, the great Obsidian Festival, and this coastal city with its volcanic smell...

Herman:
The Siesta that holds the memory of countless people, will be gone forever.

Herman:
Perhaps one day, you'll be able to tell her what I've told you here today.

Herman:
Perhaps that day will never come.

Herman:
And one day, should she perhaps need my help, you can come find me.

Herman:
No matter where Siesta is or what it looks like, this city will forever support her.

Herman:
Or rather, I should say... As long as Siestans exist, Siesta also exists. Within the hearts of young people like her are where Siesta really is.

Herman:
Now, seize the day, and enjoy the Obsidian Festival.

Herman:
At least until we find another suitable location, we'll have to suspend our collaboration with Siren Records. I have a lot of things to discuss with them.

Herman:
Schwarz seems to have something to tell you. She's over there.

Herman:
If I keep talking for much longer, she won't have anything to say. You should hear it from her.

Schwarz:
...Sir.

Herman:
Don't mind me. This is between you youngsters.

Schwarz:
Hello.

Schwarz:
Don't worry, I'm not your enemy anymore.

Schwarz:
Oh, hello to you too, stranger.

Schwarz:
I'll pass for now.

Schwarz:
Actually, I wasn't really going to say anything special.

Schwarz:
At first, I was going to give you a good beating. Miss Ceylon never have been subjected to such danger.

Schwarz:
But, I have to thank you as well. Without your help, we might never have been able to clear up our misunderstanding.

Schwarz:
Truthfully, I did not want her getting involved with these things, but perhaps you were right. She has her own ideas, and her own responsibilities.

Schwarz:
...Thank you. Were it not for you, everything I loved would have been destroyed by the volcano.

Schwarz:
I am in your debt.

Ceylon:
Doctor!

Ceylon:
Hey, Schwarz, what are you doing here?

Schwarz:
...Milady?

Ceylon:
Perfect timing. I have something important to announce!

Ceylon:
I am going to submit my resume to Rhodes Island.

Ceylon:
As I said, I'm interested in joining your company.

Ceylon:
Heheh~ I already asked Miss Eyjafjalla and Miss Skyfire about it. They said I have their recommendations.

Ceylon:
After seeing your abilities throughout this whole situation, I've come to this decision after careful deliberation.

Schwarz:
But Rhodes Island is not a simple drug company...

Ceylon:
That's why I want you to come with me.

Ceylon:
By the way, my father already approved of it.

Schwarz:
...I know. If that is what you desire, milady.

Ceylon:
So, Doctor, we're going to be colleagues from now on!

Ceylon:
Come on, Doctor! The experiment is about to start!

Ceylon:
Ah fine, forget it. Schwarz, go drag Doctor over here!

Schwarz:
...Your voice is loud enough to crack the ceiling, milady. I'm sure the Doctor has heard it.

Schwarz:
...Doctor, I don't know what you're waiting for, but in times like these, Miss Ceylon won't care what we're thinking.

Schwarz:
It would behoove you to walk over there yourself. It'd be a bit unsightly if you really wanted me to carry you over.

Schwarz:
Very well.

Schwarz:
Please wait a moment, milady. We'll be there shortly.

Schwarz:
Let's go, Doctor.
