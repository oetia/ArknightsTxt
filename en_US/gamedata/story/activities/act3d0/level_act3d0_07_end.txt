Herman:
You've been by my side for fifteen years, but you've learned nothing.

Herman:
All you've managed to pick up are some unsavory tactics. What a dullard you are.

Cronin:
Dullard? Ahaha... Ahahahaha!

Cronin:
Old man, surely you didn't expect me to be out of moves already!

Hellagur:
What's going on?

Ceylon:
This... Could it be the earthquake preceding the eruption?!

Cronin:
Ahaha, come! It's finally here!

Cronin:
Turn into ashes along with this city!

Cronin:
It's too late now! Even if you take control of the broadcast tower, the people will only start panicking!

Cronin:
The volcano is about to erupt, but what can you possibly accomplish with that 'data' of yours?

Cronin:
I control all the escape passages! None of you are going to get away!

Cronin:
You bloody hypocrites can't save anyone!

Cronin:
Everything will be burnt to nothingness, along with the city!

Ceylon:
Doctor, what do we do?!

Hellagur:
Doctor, should we mobilize the entirety of Rhodes Island...

Eyjafjalla:
Doctor, can you hear me? I've finished analyzing the volcano!

Eyjafjalla:
If we act now, we can still buy more time!

Provence:
Doctor, we've already determined the underlying cause of the volcano's activity. There's a good possibility that we might be able to stop the eruption!

Eyjafjalla:
Everyone, please stay calm and listen closely. If you follow my instructions, we will be able to delay the eruption!

Hellagur:
We can definitely help, if it's really something within our power.

Schwarz:
...Mhm.

Ceylon:
No, please let us handle this.

Ceylon:
Cronin has been plotting this for a long time. His henchmen must be all over the city.

Ceylon:
This is the critical moment. Schwarz, Mister Hellagur, you have your own duties.

Schwarz:
We can leave those things to the others...

Ceylon:
But this is our mission.

Herman:
Ceylon...

Provence:
Agreed.

Provence:
We're Catastrophe Messengers, volcanologists, and Originium researchers. None of us will just sit and watch while peoples' lives are threatened by something predictable.

Provence:
What's more, there are people who would use their knowledge to deceive others and line their own pockets. As a Catastrophe Messenger, I can't tolerate seeing people like that!

Hellagur:
I've never seen you get this serious before, but I understand. In any case, Mayor, allow us to aid you with the evacuation.

Herman:
...Very well. Schwarz, you should come too.

Schwarz:
I'm...

Herman:
Ceylon said she can handle this.

Schwarz:
...Milady, please be careful.

Eyjafjalla:
Have we finished deciding? We don't have much time!

Ceylon:
Okay! Let's get going right now!

Schwarz:
...

Herman:
We should trust her. Besides, what she said was right. We each have our own duty to fulfill.

Cronin:
Gahahaha! They're just rushing towards death! Even if they manage to buy an hour or two, so what?!

Cronin:
Your daughter is going to get buried along with most of this city, and you won't even be able to find her body...

Cronin:
Guh...

Hellagur:
Sorry, I couldn't control myself.

Herman:
Don't worry. He's right about the threat this poses. We can't afford to endanger the citizens any longer.

Herman:
Please lend me your assistance.
