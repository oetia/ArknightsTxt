Female Tourist:
Was that an earthquake just now?

Male Tourist:
Yeah!!

Male Tourist:
We're so close to the stage, after all! Did you see that? Did you see D.D.D.'s expression?! How did she do that?!

Female Tourist:
She already left the stage, don't always be such a fanboy... Wait, isn't it shaking again?

Male Tourist:
Oh come on, it's probably just the subwoofer... Wait...

Female Tourist:
H-huh...? You felt that too?

Male Tourist:
...Let's go!

Female Tourist:
Wh-what?!

Male Tourist:
Don't ask questions, just come with me!

Audience:
Stop pushing! Some personal space here!

Audience:
You're stepping on my foot!! Get out of my face!!

Audience:
Someone fainted! Watch out!

Female Tourist:
Wh-why is everyone panicking? Don't tell me...

Male Tourist:
Oh my god...

Male Tourist:
...It's Emperor.

Emperor:
Ahem, nice weather we're having.

(Cheering)

Male Tourist:
Emperor! It's really him!! Wooowwww...!

Female Tourist:
...

Male Tourist:
Don't be stupid! It's THE EMPEROR! And you still think it's some earthquake?!

Female Tourist:
No, I'm just too excited, from seeing... Wait, I kind of... can't breathe...

Bodyguard:
Mister Emperor, this way please.

Bodyguard:
Ladies and gentlemen! Please move back! Stand behind the line!

Emperor:
Hey, young man, that Savran over there.

Emperor:
It's okay. Let them come closer.

Bodyguard:
But Mister Emperor, you still have a performance later. If some kind of accident were to happen...

Emperor:
Accident?

Emperor:
You mean an attempted shooting, assassination, kidnapping, suicide threat, or something along those lines?

Emperor:
Do you think those things can stop me? Me?

Emperor:
No, those things shall only become a part of my show, just like how rhythm breaks apart the meaning of words. Do you understand?

Bodyguard:
Well, no...

Emperor:
To put it simply, it's all theatrics. Just relax. I promise, Siren won't blame you for it.

(Cheering)

Audience:
Emperor!! Emperor!! Emperor!!

Strange-Looking Tourist:
...

Emperor:
Ah, you're here. Come, don't be nervous. Just relax, muster up some bravery, and believe in yourself.

Strange-Looking Tourist:
Columbia's Rap God? You're nothing but a thug, a mongrel that got a little lucky...

Emperor:
Louder, pal, let me hear you! Hey, Savran, don't drive him away. Give him the mic. Don't worry. Just do as I say.

Strange-Looking Tourist:
You ruined our lives, but you still sit atop so much wealth... You, you deserve only death!!

Female Tourist:
Noooo! He has a crossbow! Take cover!

Strange-Looking Tourist:
Don't blame me. That's right, it's all your fault. Just how many singers were sacrificed for your so-called 'rap empire'...

Strange-Looking Tourist:
Emperor? Eat dirt, you bottom-feeding penguin!

Emperor:
Ahaha, let me think about that one. Who's the one playing dirty? Riling up the media, manipulating public opinion, personal attacks, and now even a shooting attempt? Hmph.

Emperor:
You think I'd forget who you are just because you decided to roll around in the sewers? Will pointing your weapon at these youngsters satisfy you, 'Songster?'

Strange-Looking Tourist:
You...!

Emperor:
If I wasn't such a juicy target for you, how many rising stars would you have continued to 'eliminate' just for not suiting your tastes?

Emperor:
How long did you think you'd get away with spitting on the entirety of Columbia while stuffing your bathtub full of money?

Strange-Looking Tourist:
Shut up! Just die!

Bodyguard:
Protect Mister Emperor!

Bodyguard:
Mister Emperor has been shot! Wait... what?

Bodyguard:
Mister Emperor was the one who shot first? That bastard's crossbow went flying!

Emperor:
Ratatat tat! Bang!

Emperor:
How strange. You were the one running your muzzle, but how come my muzzle is smoking first? Why don't ya take a guess?

Emperor:
Is it because ya got no game, or is my brilliance that is to blame?

Strange-Looking Tourist:
Guh... You... even brought guns with you...

Emperor:
If you die several times every day, there are games that you just won't play.

Strange-Looking Tourist:
*cough* *cough*... Do you really... think I'm alone? Think about all the enemies you've made. You won't leave Siesta alive!

Emperor:
My past is more expansive than this sea of falsity; so where are these 'enemies' that await my majesty?

Bodyguard:
Mister Emperor! Many of his rabble are hidden among the audience. We can't deal with all of them...

Emperor:
That's all right. Don't panic. Just maintain the order here, and leave the rest to the professionals.

Emperor:
Professionals, like Penguin Logistics.

Croissant:
...If I remember properly, weren't we supposed to be on vacation? Just out of curiosity, are we getting paid overtime for this?

Texas:
I could use some exercise after being cooped up in that hotel room.

Sora:
Tex- err, I mean, 'Sora,' that's... because you stayed in the hotel reading books the whole time...

Texas:
...Right, that was part of the agreement. Are you able to adapt to the battlefield?

Sora:
No problem!

Exusiai:
Boss, we're all done here. Remember to snag me the front row seats for tomorrow's show!

Bodyguard:
Mister Emperor, wh-who are these people?

Texas:
We are the Boss's... Well, Mister Emperor's private bodyguards.

Croissant:
We're a logistics company though.

Exusiai:
Well, since the beginning, our business covers quite a wide range of things. We even bought a jazz bar at some point, right?

Sora:
There were also those Siracusan gangs that really liked being our punching bags. They've been behaving better recently though.

Emperor:
How many fights do you think we have in Lungmen every month?

Emperor:
When it comes to brawls and firefights, we're the best you're going to find.

Agitated Audience:
I've been waiting for this moment! Penguin from the West! Since you finally dared to expose yourself, die!!

Emperor:
...Did you guys establish the Guild of Hypocrites or something? Very well, I was about to say the same thing about you bunch.

Emperor:
Texas, do it.

Texas:
Got... Oops.

Sora:
...Got it! It's showtime!
