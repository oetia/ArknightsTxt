Ceylon:
Quick! Doctor! Let's head towards the beach!

Ceylon:
There are a ton of tourists gathered on the beach, so we'll be able to blend into the crowd and shrug them off!

Bodyguard:
Stand still!

Ceylon:
You wish!

Schwarz:
...

Ceylon:
Schwarz! Great! You're finally here!

Ceylon:
I'm so glad you're here. What's going on with Cronin?!

Ceylon:
Doctor, she's the one I was telling you about...

Schwarz:
Milady, Master Doykos is currently out of town. You ought to listen to Cronin.

Ceylon:
Schwarz? What are you saying...?

Schwarz:
Let's head back to Cronin now and hand these people over.

Schwarz:
I do not wish to resort to violence, milady.

Ceylon:
...Schwarz?
