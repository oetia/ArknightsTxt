D.D.D.:
EVERYONE!! ARE YOU READY?!!

D.D.D.:
The greatest collaborative concert of the Obsidian Festival will begin in just three hours!

Audience:
WOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Cronin:
It's about time. As long as Schwarz and Rhodes Island can fight each other to a standstill, things will go smoothly here.

Cronin:
I knew pitting them against each other would be a masterful move. Heh.

Cronin:
Hurry up! Move these things out of here! Pick up the pace, or you won't be seeing your paychecks!

Cronin:
Hmm? What's that sound coming from outside?

Ceylon:
Doctor, if we just rush into the broadcast tower, I'm sure we'll run straight into Cronin's ambush.

Ceylon:
If we move together, Schwarz will definitely try to disarm your forces first, and I won't be able to contain her at all.

Ceylon:
Even if we seize the broadcast tower by force, without the support of the government, my words will only confuse the public and cause panic.

Ceylon:
If Schwarz is protecting Cronin, that will prove to be a major obstacle for you.

Ceylon:
Most importantly, you'll have to figure out a way to find out whatever Cronin is hiding.

Ceylon:
Maybe Cronin really is innocent, but...

Hellagur:
In that case, we'd just force him to announce the news?

Ceylon:
Right. If that's what it boils down to, I don't mind using force, since I was thinking the same thing.

Hellagur:
That takes some guts, Miss Ceylon. Maybe even borders on reckless.

Ceylon:
Rhodes Island has already proven my conclusion through their lab tests. If I don't do this, countless lives are going to be lost here.

Hellagur:
I'm not trying to blame you, Miss. I just don't get to decide whether Rhodes Island can go along with your plan.

Ceylon:
Do you mean...

Hellagur:
Doctor. You should be well aware of our options as well as their consequences. What should we do?

Hellagur:
So, who will take responsibility for this?

Hellagur:
That's our Doctor.

Hellagur:
Miss Ceylon, let's go before it's too late.

Ceylon:
Doctor...

Ceylon:
I understand. I'll hold Schwarz back.

Ceylon:
Besides, there's something I must do. I need to know the answer...

Ceylon:
Schwarz...

Ceylon:
Why are you pushing me away?

Schwarz:
...

Schwarz:
Milady, you've received an education in Victoria. You belong somewhere better. Don't stay here and struggle with people like us.

Ceylon:
...No. I don't agree with that.

Ceylon:
Schwarz, what do you think I see you as? And what do you think of me as?

Schwarz:
I am not the person you think I am, milady.

Ceylon:
Because you've killed someone?

Schwarz:
...

Ceylon:
Because you've killed many people?

Schwarz:
No, milady. That's enough.

Ceylon:
Perhaps we're both mistaken, Schwarz.

Schwarz:
I don't want you to know about that, milady!

Ceylon:
Sorry.

Schwarz:
...Milady?

Ceylon:
I already know. I've already heard about your past... even if it's just a little bit of it.

Ceylon:
I'm sorry if you didn't want me to learn about it, but I can't just feign ignorance.

Schwarz:
No, milady! You're not supposed to know that! You should have...

Ceylon:
I should have what? Kept doing what was expected of me? Kept studying hard, and then rise to the upper class? As if!

Ceylon:
I'm not some delicate flower, nor am I an ignorant little princess! I have something that I must do!

Ceylon:
All of us have a responsibility to protect Siesta. You and I, and my father as well! None of us are bystanders!

Ceylon:
You didn't want me to get involved in this in order to protect me, right?

Schwarz:
No, I...

Ceylon:
You're just like my father. Trying to dictate everything for me because it's 'for my own good,' but I don't think so!

Ceylon:
So what if what I'm doing is dangerous? So what if you have a dark past?! Maybe I'll cry or be terrified or even be hurt by these things...

Ceylon:
But if you ever say 'Ceylon, I need your help,' I'll always be there for you! No matter what you have to say, I'll always lend you my ear!

Ceylon:
If we really are friends, then we should do that for each other. How can we be considered friends when you're the only one doing the giving?!

Ceylon:
So, Schwarz, would you help me right now?

Ceylon:
You asked me before why I'm doing this. And this is my answer...

Ceylon:
So, would you give me your response, Schwarz? If what happened in the past is truly in the past, could you be my friend again, just like before?

Schwarz:
Milady... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I've done and said. My actions have caused a misunderstanding between us that never should have happened...

Ceylon:
Ah...

Schwarz:
Milady, you are my friend. And you always have been.

Cronin's Henchman:
...

Cronin's Henchman:
Are you two still chit-chatting? What's the verdict? What's going on over there?

Schwarz:
Milady, please tell me, what are we going to do next?

Ceylon:
Huh? I, um... I'd like to spread the news about the impending Catastrophe through official channels.

Ceylon:
Rhodes Island should be collecting evidence against Cronin as we speak, and he'll soon be kicked out of the City Council...

Ceylon:
However, after the news gets out, the Obsidian Festival will have to be canceled, and Siesta will have to move...

Schwarz:
Don't worry, milady.

Ceylon:
R-really?

Schwarz:
If that's what you desire, then I will support you.

Ceylon:
Schwarz...

Schwarz:
Milady, do you need me to protect you?

Ceylon:
Mm, yes.

Schwarz:
In that case, please take cover. It'll be over soon.

Cronin's Henchman:
Schwarz, what are you doing? Are you disobeying Cronin's orders?

Schwarz:
Orders? Support Cronin? That's just a disguise. Since the very beginning, I've only had two orders.

Schwarz:
First, Master Doykos asked me to collect evidence against Cronin, including his secret manipulation of V3 Industries and his unauthorized harvesting of obsidian.

Schwarz:
Now that the truth has come to light, the gig is up.

Cronin's Henchman:
G-get them, quickly! Seize both of them, now!

Schwarz:
As for the second order, you just heard it.

Schwarz:
...Milady asked me to protect her.
