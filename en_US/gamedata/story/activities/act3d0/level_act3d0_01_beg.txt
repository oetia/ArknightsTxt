Skyfire:
Provence.

Skyfire:
Provence, you're absolutely, positively sure I can't burn this place down to the ground?

Skyfire:
All these useless branches and weeds are really getting on my nerves.

Provence:
This is the tenth time I've heard you complaining this hour, princess.

Provence:
Besides, I originally planned on just checking out some stuff alone while collecting some samples for Eyjafjalla along the way.

Provence:
You offered to join me in this investigation yourself, so nobody's forcing you to stay if you can't handle it.

Provence:
Right now, the others are having fun at the beach. You should join them instead of going through this mess here with me.

Skyfire:
I can't leave you alone, not with your tendencies.

Skyfire:
Even though you're a Catastrophe Messenger, only my knowledge can keep you safe in this kind of fire hazard area.

Provence:
All the more reason we can't set this entire mountain on fire.

Provence:
Even though I know this is your specialty... we're on vacation this time. It'd be best to keep a low profile.

Provence:
Otherwise, Amiya and the Doctor will end up having to clean up the mess again.

Skyfire:
Fine, for their sake, I'll try to put up with this a bit longer.

Skyfire:
Hey, do you see that black-colored outcropping over there?

Skyfire:
Looks like it might be obsidian. Let's go check it out.

Provence:
Careful now, don't just go running around. And especially, don't set stuff on fire.

Provence:
Phew... Keeping her in check is more tiring than the investigation itself.

Provence:
But something's off... Even if it's summer, this kind of heat... doesn't seem natural.

Skyfire:
Big tail.

Provence:
...

Skyfire:
Hey, Big tail!

Provence:
Hmm? Wait, you mean me?

Skyfire:
Did you notice a weird smell earlier?

Provence:
Now that you mention it...

Provence:
Hmm. Very faint, but it's definitely there.

Skyfire:
The volcano is expelling more gas than I expected, and the test rune Eyjafjalla gave me is reacting.

Skyfire:
By the looks of things, this place is going to go up in flames even without my help.

Provence:
Something doesn't seem right about this volcano...

Provence:
But the most we can do is turn to Eyjafjalla for confirmation.

Skyfire:
Over here, we can get some samples from this outcropping.

Provence:
Ha!

Provence:
There, that should be enough!

Skyfire:
We can do some preliminary tests on this sample with our equipment before sending it back to Rhodes Island.

Skyfire:
Eyjafjalla should be able to turn the test results around right away.

Provence:
Just based upon how this obsidian feels to the touch... I can't say for sure, but there's something different about it.

Provence:
Also taking the smell and the temperature around here into consideration...

Provence:
I can't say for certain, but...

Skyfire:
What are you trying to say? Spit it out already!

???:
Come at me! What are a few slugs going to do?! I'll take you all out right here!

???:
Curses, the hem of my skirt got stuck...

???:
C-can anyone hear me?! Why are there so many Originium slugs here?!

???:
N-no! Stay away from me! Someone help me!

Provence:
Someone's calling for help! It's coming from the beach!

Provence:
Let's hurry over there!

Skyfire:
Hey, wait for me!
