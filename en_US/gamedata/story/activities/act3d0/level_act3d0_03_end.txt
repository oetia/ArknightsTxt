Bodyguard A:
Hoooooooot! I'm burning! I'm burning!

Bodyguard B:
Eeek! My hair!

Bodyguard A:
Tsk... Fall back, fall back!

Ifrit:
Hahaha! See, nothing's more fun than a good scrap, Doc!

Ifrit:
Oh, that reminds me, Doc. Because I saved you, and didn't go overboard like you asked me to, you'd better not tell Silence about this!

Ifrit:
If she finds out about this, she's going to assign me more homework for sure!

Ifrit:
Hehe, I knew that you're a nice person, Doc!

Ifrit:
Hmph, you're on your own then!

Ceylon:
An Originium-powered flamethrower, with such power too... You must be a very skilled Caster.

Ifrit:
You're right on the money, Missy! I'm super powerful!

Ceylon:
My name is Ceylon.

Ceylon:
Thank you for saving us.

Ifrit:
Oh, um... it's my pleasure. I-I'm just doing the right thing.

Ifrit:
Hey Doc, this lady is really polite. What should I be doing now?

Ifrit:
Oh, um, I'll try it then...

Ifrit:
Ahh?! I forgot that I left meat on the grill! Gotta get going!

Ifrit:
Doc, Ceylon, come find me afterwards if you want some barbecue!

Ceylon:
Doctor, let's also hurry back.

???:
Doctor, I'm glad you're fine.

Ceylon:
Thank you very much, Mister...

Hellagur:
You can call me Hellagur.

Hellagur:
Just like the Doctor here, I'm also from Rhodes Island.

Hellagur:
Doctor, do you have a minute? I need to have a few words with you, alone.
