Ceylon:
Th-they've all been knocked out? I... never knew you were so powerful.

Ceylon:
I've thought about it before, but...

Schwarz:
That's why I didn't want you to know.

Ceylon:
But that was amazing! You're really cool, Schwarz!

Schwarz:
Ugh...

Ceylon:
How'd you jump that high?! You ran up the wall and did a somersault!

Ceylon:
Then you spun around in midair and dodged all their shots!

Ceylon:
Then you turned around, and bang bang! You took them all out just like that! My goodness!

Schwarz:
Milady... You're making me blush.

Ceylon:
But Schwarz, there is one thing I have to correct. I wasn't giving you an order. That was just a request from a friend.

Ceylon:
If you ever need anything from me, just tell me.

Schwarz:
Understood.

Ceylon:
Hmm? What did I just say?

Schwarz:
...Huh?

Ceylon:
There's no need to talk like that! We're friends, friends!

Schwarz:
Um... sure then.

Ceylon:
Haha! Let's head to the City Hall now. I wonder how Rhodes Island is doing...

Cronin:
These imbeciles... They can't even stop a little girl?!

Cronin's Bodyguard:
But she's a Sarkazian! Plus, there are several others with her!

Cronin:
It's only a handful of them!

Cronin:
D-damn it! What is Rhodes Island doing here?!

Vigna:
Huh... Feels like these guys are even weaker than Originium slugs...

Cronin:
Call everyone over here right now!

Cronin's Bodyguard:
But, Mister Cronin...

Cronin's Bodyguard:
I don't think numbers are going to help!

Cronin:
No such thing! Don't you dare take a step back!

Vigna:
*yawn*... Hey Doctor, did you find it yet? I still want to go see that concert. We're going to miss it if we take too long here.

Vigna:
Huh? You found it? See, beating some sense into them works after all. Meteorite was right. Sometimes, violence solves everything!

Cronin:
D-Damn it all!

Cronin:
Whatever. As long as I can get out of here, it's easy enough to forge a registration.

Vigna:
Ah, Doctor, he jumped out from the window!

Vigna:
Okay~

Vigna:
Hmm, the General is still out there, right? I feel like this Cronin is going to have a tragic end... It would've been better for him to stay inside.

Vigna:
C'mon, Doctor, I'll help you out!

Cronin:
*gasp* *gasp*... Damn it...

Cronin:
I've got... to call the others back right now!

Hellagur:
Last time, it was Miss Ceylon and the Doctor of Rhodes Island jumping out from that window.

Hellagur:
This time, it's you. Karma is poetic, isn't it, Mister Cronin?

Hellagur:
These things happen in life, sir.

Cronin:
You... You! What'd you do to them? What'd you do to them?!

Hellagur:
They'd be an eyesore to the beautiful view here.

Hellagur:
By the way, you've kept these young ladies waiting for quite some time.

Cronin:
Schwarz...

Cronin:
You two are standing together, which means...

Hellagur:
Doctor, please be careful. He may make one last desperate attempt.

Cronin:
Damn you... All of you...!

Ceylon:
Your plot has been exposed, Cronin!
