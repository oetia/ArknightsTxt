Broadcast:
Everyone, are you getting all fired up?!

Broadcast:
In order to welcome the hottest concert in the Obsidian Festival...

Broadcast:
Starting from 12 o'clock today, all the malls, recreational facilities, and even some of your favorite bars and restaurants will hold a variety of warm-up activities!

Broadcast:
You do not want to miss out!

Schwarz:
I knew you'd come here, milady.

Ceylon:
Schwarz...

Schwarz:
I knew you'd come here. After Cronin turned you down, you'd try to use the broadcast tower to spread the news so that the entire city would hear it.

Schwarz:
This won't work, milady. It will only cause confusion and chaos.

Schwarz:
Perhaps you hate your father and this city, but Master Doykos has already given enough. This will lead to the demise of the Obsidian Festival and Siesta as a whole.

Ceylon:
I know that the news will cause an uproar and maybe even have far-reaching consequences, but the truth needs to be heard.

Schwarz:
I know Master Doykos has made mistakes in the past. Though he has done a lot of wrong, Siesta would not exist were it not for his actions.

Ceylon:
This has nothing to do with that!

Schwarz:
Feel free to criticize me if you must, but please do not do something that is beyond redemption.

Ceylon:
Do you... do you really think I'm just some child throwing a temper tantrum?

Schwarz:
No, milady. I'll try to persuade Master Doykos, I promise you. But just for now, let's head back together.

Ceylon:
Schwarz... Don't talk to me like that.

Schwarz:
I know you and Master Doykos currently do not see eye to eye, but for the time being, you should head home first.

Ceylon:
I told you not to talk to me like that! I know that you're trying to mend our relationship, but could you not be like that?!

Ceylon:
Why can't you treat me like you used to? Talk to me as a friend, Schwarz!

Schwarz:
I am simply a servant of the Doykos family.

Ceylon:
Don't say that, Schwarz. I don't want to hear you talk like that! What happened to you? Why would you treat me like this?

Schwarz:
...

Cronin's Henchman:
What are you doing? Seize her this instant!

Schwarz:
...She is the master's daughter. Watch your words.

Cronin's Henchman:
But the mayor told you to give your full support to Mister Cronin! Are you going to let her destroy Siesta with her poisonous rumors?

Schwarz:
...Use your brain for a moment. She came here alone, without even the slightest show of anxiety...

Schwarz:
Do you really think she's trying to enter the broadcast tower?

Cronin's Henchman:
What?!

Schwarz:
Forget it.

Schwarz:
Milady, you're using yourself to distract me, right?

Ceylon:
...You still know me well.

Schwarz:
I wouldn't say that, milady. But since you didn't deny it, I can surmise as much.

Ceylon:
Right now, Rhodes Island should already be at the City Hall.

Cronin's Henchman:
Wh-what?! That's not a part of the plan! What's going on at the City Hall?

Schwarz:
I'd assume the thugs over there are getting a good beating just about now.

Cronin's Bodyguard:
Why's it so quiet out there? I told them to hurry up and carry the materials away. They dare slack off on such an urgent task?

Cronin's Bodyguard:
Hmm? What was that noise? Did another fight break out? Whatever, I need to finish that task...

Girl's Voice:
Sir, please open the door! We have a package to deliver!

Cronin's Bodyguard:
(Huh? Did any of you order something?)

Cronin's Bodyguard:
(No? That's weird...)

Cronin's Bodyguard:
You've got the wrong address!

Girl's Voice:
But sir, the label on the parcel says it's right here...?

Cronin's Bodyguard:
Get lost! If you keep bothering us, I'm gonna teach you a lesson!

Girl's Voice:
...

Cronin's Bodyguard:
Tsk... Sly little devil, trying to trick us again.

Girl's Voice:
Ah, screw it! Doctor, stand aside, I'm kicking the door down!

Girl's Voice:
What?! Don't worry! I'm more than strong enough!

Cronin's Bodyguard:
Huh?

Vigna:
Hah!

Cronin's Bodyguard:
Whaaaat?! The main door...! My god, what kind of monster are youâ€”

Vigna:
Hehe, I've always wanted to give that a try. And now, there's this line...

Vigna:
Um, ahem!

Vigna:
'FBI! Open up!'
