Schwarz:
Cronin's orders are now the Mayor's orders. Everyone, go.

Schwarz:
Tie these people up. Do not hurt Miss Ceylon.

Ceylon:
What? Why?!

Ceylon:
Do you also think I'm doing this for fun?!

Bodyguard A:
They are currently fleeing towards the beach!

Bodyguard B:
Damn, it's too crowded. We won't be able to give chase. Call the sentry at the beach. Surround them!

Schwarz:
Get back here!

Schwarz:

???:
Doctor, go. I'll handle things here.

Ceylon:
Huh? You're...!

Ceylon:
Wait... *gasp* *gasp*... Doctor, I'm tired...

Bodyguard:
Milady, please come back with us.

Ceylon:
No!

Bodyguard A:
Don't hurt Lady Ceylon. As for that 'Doctor,' do as you please.

???:
How dare you treat Doctor like that!!

Bodyguard B:
It burns! It burns!!

Bodyguard C:
Where'd that imp come from?!

Bodyguard C:
Yowwwch! My butt! It's on fire!

Ifrit:
Hey Doc, you're having fun again. Why didn't you call me?

Bodyguard A:
Tsk... She's just a runt. Show her what we're made of!

Ifrit:
Perfect. I was starting to get bored, hehe...

Ceylon:
Doctor, you look even paler than before. What's wrong?

Ifrit:
Fine...

Ifrit:
All right, medium rare it is!
