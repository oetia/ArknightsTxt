Schwarz:
Alpha, Bravo, stay back and monitor them carefully. Charlie, wrap around and flank them.

Hellagur:
Mercenaries, huh...

Hellagur:
Whoever trained them must've been rather skilled. Not bad, but also not good enough.

Bodyguard:
Th-this old man is strong!

Schwarz:
You're no match for him. Stand by for now.

Hellagur:
...

Hellagur:
(This woman... won't be simple to deal with.)

Hellagur:
(These bodyguards won't be able to harm me, but she poses a threat.)

Schwarz:
Foolish outsiders...

Hellagur:
(She's angry now.)

Hellagur:
(Perhaps from her perspective, she really believes that we deceived Miss Ceylon.)

Hellagur:
(But, something's not right. Just who is she...)

Hellagur:
You must be a pretty experienced mercenary, staying disciplined even though your Mistress is gone.

Bodyguard:
Cut the crap! Since you know that our boss was... Ugh...

Schwarz:
Shut up.

Hellagur:
(Hmm...? Wait... A crossbow, Feline, and that name...)

Hellagur:
(Where have I heard that name before...)

Bodyguard:
Wait, what is this geezer doing?!

Hellagur:
(I'm a bit worried about how the Doctor is doing.)

Hellagur:
(...But the Doctor is capable enough, as are the others. There shouldn't be any issue.)

Bodyguard:
Is he senile or something? He's charging straight at us!

Bodyguard:
Hurry, stop him!!!

Hellagur:
You'll have to be faster than that!
