???:
The sample data from the volcano monitoring station has been retrieved. Please look over it.

Woman's Voice:
Just tell me the results.

???:
Those people over there said that the sample's temperature has not yet exceeded the highest on record for this year.

???:
It's also not quite at the levels of the peaks from the past three years. The state of steam emissions is normal as well.

???:
So...

Woman's Voice:
So?

???:
So, the station concludes that nothing abnormal will happen with the volcano, and your request for announcement has been denied once again. The mayor also...

Woman's Voice:
You've got to be kidding me!!

Woman's Voice:
Although my methods may be a bit simple, I'm sure that there's something amiss about this sample here.

Woman's Voice:
The volcano was already in a precarious state last year!

Woman's Voice:
But they didn't even send a warning or make a news report! Nothing at all!!

???:
Miss Ceylon, p-please calm down.

???:
If the monitoring station says that there's no abnormality, nobody will trust us no matter what we do.

Ceylon:
I'm sorry...

Ceylon:
Can we really rely on the monitoring station's data?

???:
To be honest, Siesta's City Council doesn't pay much attention to this. Perhaps something is wrong with the detector.

Ceylon:
That would mean that the fact that the volcano has become abnormal is being covered up.

???:
So, what are you going to do next?

Ceylon:
I can't explain the current phenomenon based upon what I know. If we can't get an accurate report from those in charge, we'll have to turn to an outside organization.

Ceylon:
So far, things are stable here and we still have time. Would we be able to find some professionals among the tourists here if we took the time?

Ceylon:
Even though we can't expect to find the right people, nor can we expect them to reach the correct conclusion, this is our last chance...

Ceylon:
The tourists have already begun to pour into Siesta.

Ceylon:
After all, the Obsidian Festival is about to begin. If we don't act now, it'll soon be too late.

Amiya:
Siesta really is a prime tourist city. The atmosphere here is filled with excitement.

Amiya:
Neither did I!

Amiya:
None of us expected it to be such a spectacular place. We originally thought it was just another normal coastal city.

Amiya:
Thanks for the recommendation, Dr. Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
...I'm not interested in that place. Just go there yourselves.

Blaze:
Wait for me! I wanna come too!

Kal'tsit:
Stop right there. You're not allowed to go since you're still recovering.

Amiya:
Doctor, I'm happy as long as you're enjoying it here.

Amiya:
We've been through too much recently. You deserve a break.

Amiya:
A lot of our fellow Operators have come with us, so let's all take this opportunity to relax.

Amiya:
Ah, Doctor, look! Someone's playing the piano in public.

Amiya:
Look, there are guitarists over there, as well as violinists. Wow, even dancers too...

Amiya:
It reminds me of when I used to practice the violin every day.

Amiya:
The streets give off a totally different vibe than the beach.

Amiya:
This is my first time seeing so many performers in one place, it makes me want to join them.

Amiya:
No no, that's not what I meant. I'm not really going to join them!

Amiya:
If I wanted to get back to the level I was at before, I'd have to start practicing again.

Amiya:
Th-that's not true!

Amiya:
But, I'm still happy to hear you say that, Doctor.

Amiya:
Hey, Sora?

Sora:
Ah, Doctor! Amiya! Good morning, are you two also headed to Second Avenue?

Amiya:
Good morning, Sora. I didn't know you were a fan of jazz as well.

Amiya:
I thought you would've preferred pop music more.

Sora:
When it comes to music, I'm an expert in all the genres!

Sora:
...Actually, I wanted to check out some other places, but the show near the hotel last night was way too loud. I couldn't sleep without earplugs.

Sora:
Even though it's great to be able to listen to music throughout the day, anything will get on your nerves if it's keeping you up at night.

Sora:
Because the others got a bit too crazy last night, all I can do is take a little breather around here.

Amiya:
It's a music festival after all, that just proves how lively things are here.

Sora:
Ahaha, guess so. A few of us have never seen the ocean before.

Sora:
For example, Ifrit rushed out this morning yelling something like 'Here I come, ocean!!' We haven't seen her ever since.

Amiya:
Haha, that's just like her.

Amiya:
Technically, this ocean is really just a huge lake...

Sora:
As long as there's water and a beach, it's enough of an ocean for me.

Sora:
I'll be resting here until noon. After that, even a volcanic eruption can't stop me from having the time of my life!

Amiya:
Haha, that certainly is your style. All right, I'll see you around then.

Sora:
All righty~ Amiya, Doctor, have a good time as well!

Broadcast:
It is now 11 o'clock! Everyone, did you have a fabulous morning?

Broadcast:
Let's first enjoy a cozy Siestan brunch as the merriment of the afternoon approaches us.

Broadcast:
Today, a special guest will be joining us. Let's welcome Mister Cronin, Assistant to the Mayor of Siesta and Catastrophe Messenger. Mister Cronin, why don't you tell us a bit more about Siesta and its volcano?

Cronin:
Welcome to Siesta City, my friends.

Cronin:
Siesta is home to lush mountains and clear waters, sunny skies and refreshing breezes, and the most passionate people in the world.

Cronin:
Due to the rare and perfect natural environment that we've been gifted, Siesta is committed to becoming the best tourist hotspot and bringing you an unforgettable summer getaway.

Broadcast:
On this subject, let's talk about the Siesta Volcano. Many tourists who are unfamiliar with volcanoes may have questions about this. Care to explain it to our listeners?

Cronin:
Gladly. First, there's nothing to be worried about. Unlike what some people may think, the Siesta Volcano is our friend, not something filled with mysteries and dangers.

Cronin:
I can guarantee this as a Catastrophe Messenger, so please rest assured.

Cronin:
As you may already know, Siesta's development owes greatly to the Siesta Volcano.

Cronin:
Some of you may remember the Catastrophe that almost hit Siesta a number of years back. But because of the volcano's protection, Siesta was totally unaffected.

Broadcast:
Speaking of which, Siesta has another special feature - obsidian.

Broadcast:
Obsidian is believed to have the ability to suppress Oripathy, so it has become increasingly popular in recent years.

Cronin:
That's right. The small number of Infected in Siesta is the best proof of that.

Cronin:
You may have heard rumors or even scientific 'theories' from outside, but the reality within Siesta is the best evidence.

Cronin:
Unfortunately, obsidian mining has been banned by the government in order to protect the volcano's habitat.

Cronin:
Nevertheless, the trade of existing obsidian products is legal, so if you're interested in these products, please head over to the market.

Broadcast:
During the festival, shopping guides as well as souvenir stalls will be scattered throughout the city, so feel free to take your pick!

Cronin:
The volcano has brought Siesta a precious gift, and it is our wish to pass this gift onto all of you. We hope that you will all enjoy the festival.

Broadcast:
Thank you very much, Mister Cronin. We will see you later.

Amiya:
Obsidian can keep Oripathy at bay? I've never heard about that before.

Amiya:
And that Catastrophe Messenger... the way he was dismissing science made me a bit uncomfortable...

Amiya:
In remote places like this, many people still do not know about Originium or Catastrophes.

Amiya:
I don't know if that's a blessing or a curse.

Skyfire:
Of course ignorance is a curse!

Amiya:
Skyfire, Provence! Good morning!

Provence:
Morning, Amiya. Doctor.

Provence:
What a coincidence to run into you guys here. Getting ready to hit the beach?

Amiya:
We're just looking around. What about you two?

Skyfire:
We're going to take a look around the base of the volcano.

Amiya:
The base of the volcano? Let me check the map.

Amiya:
There's no mark on it. Is there some special activity going on there?

Provence:
No, no. Skyfire just suddenly felt like taking a field trip.

Provence:
And I'm a Catastrophe Messenger, as you know. Taking a quick survey of the land when I get to a new place has just become a habit of mine.

Skyfire:
As a researcher, I'm curious about the ecosystem of the volcano. We rarely get the chance to get up close and personal with a volcano, after all.

Amiya:
That's some serious dedication, to be doing this during your vacation, Skyfire.

Skyfire:
Eheh. Of course. For me, that's what a vacation is.

Provence:
All right then, we have to get going. Bye!

Amiya:
Then, we should get going as well, Doctor.

Amiya:
The largest beach in Siesta is just ahead of us.

Amiya:
Let's go!

Male Tourist:
One Mango Martini Smoothie please.

Gummy:
Okay. Here you go, a Mango Martini Smoothie.

Female Tourist:
Two double-scoops of Strawberry Tequila Ice Cream please.

Gummy:
Here you are! Two double-scoops of Strawberry Tequila Ice Cream, coming right up! And, you get a free waffle!

Amiya:
Gummy~

Gummy:
Oh, Amiya! And the Doctor as well. Good to see you~

Amiya:
Gummy, how'd you end up running a stall here?

Gummy:
There's an entire food court by the beach. The sponsor gave the chance for tourists to show off their cooking skills.

Gummy:
Given an opportunity like this, I naturally had to promote some of Ursus's local favorites!

Gummy:
However, there are way too many tourists here, and I'm getting a bit overwhelmed.

Male Tourist:
Hey Miss, I'd like three cups of Fermented Bubble Tea with Pudding.

Gummy:
Coming right up!

Gummy:
Oh right, Doctor, can I borrow Amiya for a bit?

Amiya:
Huh?

Gummy:
If Amiya is helping me out, I'll be just fine.

Gummy:
After we're done here, I'll take her to watch the show on the beach at night!

Amiya:
Mm... all right then.

Amiya:
Doctor, call me if you need anything, okay?

Gummy:
Hmm, you know what Gummy thinks? Amiya's stressed out from always following you around, Doctor.

Gummy:
When she's with you, she never thinks about herself, which isn't good.

Amiya:
It, it's not like that...

Gummy:
I'm not buying it.

Gummy:
Besides, Doctor, you're going to scare away all my customers, all wrapped up like a mummy. Amiya is way cuter than you.

Amiya:
Th-that's not true... But, Doctor, I'll stay here and help Gummy.

Gummy:
So, Amiya, let me teach you how to use this machine.

Amiya:
Mhm.

Gummy:
Ah, no, you gotta change your outfit first. Hurry, over here, let me get you into something a bit easier to move around in!

Gummy:
Doctor, you make sure to enjoy yourself as well! Buh bye!

Male Tourist A:
Hey, did you hear that? There was another fight at First Avenue last night.

Male Tourist B:
No, I live on Fifth. I reckon it was another fight between fans?

Male Tourist A:
Yeah. Jeez, talk about crazy. The way those guys were going at it, you'd think they killed the other guy's parents or something.

Male Tourist B:
Peace is best, after all.

Male Tourist A:
...So, why don't you take off that outfit of yours already? ！

Male Tourist A:
It's not every day we get to go on vacation, so why are you all wrapped up like that?

Female Tourist A:
Hey, were you not going to come tonight? Join us!

Female Tourist C:
...Don't tell me you're going dancing again tonight.

Female Tourist A:
Of course we're going. We came here to dance!

Female Tourist C:
Give me a break, just go by yourselves then. I can barely feel my feet from following you guys the last three nights...

Female Tourist A:
Come on, it's still early! Give it a few more tries, and you'll get used to it!

Waiter:
Hello, whiskey for two.

???:
......

???:
Well well, with the way you're dressed, you look a bit unusual for a tourist...

???:
Even so, you came out all the way to the beach? What a weirdo.

???:
...Ah, I suppose I'm one to talk though.

???:
Sorry about that, let me put that one on my tab.

???:
So, what do you think about this budding city?

???:
I'm quite fond of her, you see. Youthful, but maturing well.

???:
Though I wasn't born here, this place is my home now.

???:
And I'm willing to pay a lot in order to protect it.

???:
No matter where people are from, they all hold the same love for their family, right?

Bodyguard:
Boss, Mister Cronin is looking for you.

???:
...I know.

???:
I still have work to do. I'll be off then, stranger.

???:
I hope that you too can fall in love with this city.

Provence:
Hey, Doctor, can you hear me?

Provence:
Is there anyone by you? I have something very serious to report!

Provence:
It's something that may influence whether this city lives or dies...
