Ceylon:
...Would you be able to walk around a bit with me, Doctor?

Ceylon:
Doctor, did you know? When I was a child, this beach wasn't this busy. I used to like making sand castles by myself.

Ceylon:
...This city is getting better and better every year, thanks to my father.

Ceylon:
My father and I, well, don't talk a lot.

Ceylon:
I've always wondered... Which is more important, this city and the wealth it brings, or me?

Ceylon:
My mother died when she gave birth to me. Sometimes I think about if that's the reason why he doesn't like me.

Ceylon:
And it feels like he doesn't care if I like him or not. Ever since I can remember, he has rarely been at home because of business. Rather than father and daughter, we're more like two strangers living under the same roof.

Ceylon:
Schwarz, I want to go observe the ecosystem of the beach!

Schwarz:
You mustn't, milady. Master Doykos said you must not go outside without good reason.

Ceylon:
But I'm tired of reading the same old books here! Schwarz, you're no fun at all!

Schwarz:
My apologies, milady. This is for your safety though; it's dangerous outside.

Ceylon:
But won't you be with me? Are you going to put me in danger?

Schwarz:
...Of course I wouldn't.

Ceylon:
So, what's the problem then? Let's go!

Schwarz:
...In that case, please do not stray from my sight.

Ceylon:
One could say that back then, having Schwarz at my side just felt like a simple fact of life.

Male Civilian:
Hurry up, these ornaments are for tonight's concert.

Male Civilian:
We'll be in trouble if we don't make it on time!

Ceylon:
Oh, that's...

Ceylon:
If I remember properly, he's the grandson of the owner of the Mockingbird Café on Second Avenue.

Ceylon:
I used to go there a lot. The old storekeeper was a kind man. His wife had already passed away at that time, so he decorated the café with her favorite flowers and bonsai trees, and put on their favorite music.

Ceylon:
But he did say that he was getting too old to run the shop, and would pass the business over to his grandson.

Ceylon:
Time sure flies.

Ceylon:
Why's that?

Schwarz:
Because I have Oripathy, milady.

Schwarz:
It's bad for your health to come too close to me. Please call upon me only when it is necessary.

Ceylon:
What's that? Does it hurt?

Schwarz:
...It doesn't hurt, but, I will die because of it.

Schwarz:
There is no cure for this disease, milady.

Schwarz:
And...

Ceylon:
I just have to find the cure then!

Ceylon:
Heh, just you wait! One day, I'll defeat that illness, and snatch you back from its jaws!

Ceylon:
The reason I became an Originium researcher was because of her. I wanted to cure her.

Ceylon:
That has always been the thing motivating me. I even went to Victoria to pursue this dream.

Ceylon:
However, Originium research is very difficult. At the beginning, I couldn't even grasp the basic concepts and felt like giving up. But I persevered.

Ceylon:
Victoria is also very far away, and I couldn't get used to it at first.

Ceylon:
But now, I feel like I'm more of a Victorian than a Siestan.

Ceylon:
Doctor, could it be said that everything I have is an illusion?

Schwarz:
I'm willing to pay anything to protect this place.

Ceylon:
Hmm... I suppose so. There's no way you'd be able to know.

Ceylon:
Then what is it? Something she can't even tell me about?

Ceylon:
Besides, no matter what she's struggling with, that much is inevitable because of the sins she has committed.

Ceylon:
Doctor, do you think I should give up?

Can we vanquish Oripathy?

Can we save the Infected?

Will there be an end to these tribulations?

If there is, I can't see it. I'm not sure. I don't know how to answer.

Can I just give up? Yes.

But I don't want to.

Ceylon:
Phew... You're right, Doctor.

Ceylon:
Your experience really shows. Looks like I still have a lot to learn.

Ceylon:
First, I need to stop being sentimental and start by finding the proof.

Ceylon:
If they are really putting citizens in danger on purpose, I'll do everything in my power to stop them!

Ceylon:
Because I believe in my own decisions, I'll fight to save this city, even if nobody else will!

Hellagur:
Well said.

Ceylon:
Oh, Mister Hellagur!

Hellagur:
By the looks of things, you've found your answer.

Ceylon:
Mhm. Mister Hellagur, Doctor, could you hear me out?

Ceylon:
No matter what, I don't want to see the citizens being put into danger. That's my number one priority. The largest broadcast tower here is located by the Garrison Amusement Park.

Ceylon:
It controls this city's entire broadcast system.

Hellagur:
The broadcast tower?

Ceylon:
However, it's controlled by Cronin's henchmen. He often appears there to speak to the citizens.

Ceylon:
When the major concert begins, everyone's going to be gathered by the stage. Cronin's men are going to be have their hands full trying to keep things orderly.

Ceylon:
As long as we control the tower at that time, we can spread the news throughout the whole city.

Ceylon:
So, I'm asking both of you, please lend me your aid!
