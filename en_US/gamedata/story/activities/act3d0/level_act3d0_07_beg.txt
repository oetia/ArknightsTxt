Staff:
What happened? Hello?

Alty:
Hmm? Did something happen? What's going on outside?

Staff:
Please don't worry. Everything is perfectly fine. Come this way please.

Staff:
The guests are all here, and they will take the stage in 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

Staff:
Quick! Take care of whatever is going on outside.

Cronin:
As things stand, you don't have any prestige left, Herman!

Cronin:
I've spent years training these people. Only they truly understand the wonderful life that comes from hard work!

Cronin:
Today is the climax of the festival. I'll take what has always rightfully belonged to me, and then bounce.

Cronin:
I bet you still have no idea what's going on.

Cronin:
Let me tell you out of mercy's sake. The data you got from the monitoring station is wrong. The volcano will very soon become active.

Cronin:
Originium will spread along with the eruption, and at least half of this city will be destroyed!

Cronin:
But I won't lose anything. I'll even come back after the eruption to mine the Originium!

Cronin:
Siesta is my paradise! I also deeply love this city, Herman!

Herman:
How dare you!

Cronin:
Of course I dare, as the Catastrophe Messenger of this city.

Cronin:
But all you can do is witness your defeat, then the destruction of Siesta!

Cronin:
Of course, you will get the honor of dying to the eruption of the Siesta Volcano. Other than me, nobody else shall know about the secrets of this city.

Cronin:
Rhodes... Island...

Herman:
I'm disappointed in you, Cronin.

Cronin:
Disappointed? You're the one who's disappointed? No, I'm disappointed in you!

Cronin:
I'll never forget the days when I lost my home, those sleepless nights in the dumpsters trying to take shelter from the elements!

Cronin:
Wealth is the key to a new life, and I've since come to understand that! But what about you? You wasted the money we worked so hard to earn on some Infected filth?!

Cronin:
Are you going to bury the infinite potential of Siesta beneath your hypocrisy?

Herman:
Take a good look at yourself, Cronin.

Herman:
And take all the time in the world to reflect upon what you see, in prison!
