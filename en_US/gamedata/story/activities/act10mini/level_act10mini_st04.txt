Grani:
And you don't remember when someone first opened it up?

Bean the Infected:
Has to have been two months ago, at least.

Bean the Infected:
But we always sealed this part off with planks. A few naughty kids pulled them off to climb in a while back, so it might just be the same story this time.

Grani:
Have you seen anyone go in or out?

Bean the Infected:
No, it's dark as night down here. Why would anyone?

Grani:
Alright... got it.

Grani:
*Sigh* This still isn't making sense... and it's so suspicious. I've already found six abandoned structures up till now where the entryway's started being used again.

Grani:
Plenty of witnesses are testifying about dragging sounds from the underground channels at evening, too. The atmosphere around the Infected community just doesn't sit right. It feels like someone's fiddling about.

Grani:
Not one person's got a reason to be using these entrances again...

Grani:
(Claps face)

Grani:
Forget it, enough of that for now. Both the littlest things and the big stuff the town's survival hinges on are just as important, yep!

Grani:
Let's see what else there is... Oh, yeah... the burglary case at Count Bishmer's.

Grani:
Where do I start investigating that?

Grani:
*Sigh*... Who would it be? Slipping past a noble house's strict defenses and stealing something isn't your standard thief's fare.

Grani:
According to the Count's servants, the burglar pops in and out all over the Infected neighborhood. So, they're either extra familiar with the terrain there, or have special Originium Arts.

Grani:
—Of course, that's assuming the servants aren't lying to avoid responsibility.

Grani:
...Hmm, I don't think they would though. I've heard a lot of similar reports the last two weeks. All signs say there really is some thief on the run in Caladon City.

Grani:
A very strange thief, special Originium Arts...

Grani:
Whatever, let's drop by the Infected community and see.

Infected Citizen:
Grani, finally found you!

Grani:
Mrs. Sunny? Calm down, calm down, what's the matter?

Infected Citizen:
My little Pom's run away! I've been looking for two hours already, help me find him! He usually listens so well, he's never run off before, what if someone bad finds him...

Grani:
No worries, Missus, I'll help you look right away!

Infected Citizen:
Thank you, thank you!

Grani:
Did anything happen right before Pom ran away? Have you asked anyone nearby? ...Ah, don't rush, Missus, take it slow...

An hour later.

Grani:
Over here, Mrs. Sunny, I've found Pom!

Infected Citizen:
Oh...! Let me take a look. Phew, that's a relief... he's still alright. I'm so sorry to trouble you, Grani, I know you're so busy with work, and here I am making you search for a pet of all things.

Grani:
Don't worry about it. If Pom really did vanish, you'd be torn to pieces! I wouldn't call that nothing!

Infected Citizen:
But, I heard John next door saying you aren't getting along too well with the Guards, and they even got on your case a few days ago for something or other...

Grani:
Hahaha... it was nothing.

Grani:
But if you're going to raise a fowlbeast, Mrs. Sunny, I'd recommend keeping him in a cage... Things would get hairy if he bit anyone.

Infected Citizen:
Oh, you've got a point.

Grani:
Speaking of, Missus, have you seen any strangers about the Infected community lately?

Infected Citizen:
Strangers? Plenty of the people here come from other cities—strangers aren't the strangest thing.

Grani:
I mean the sort that... um... might have uncanny Originium Arts, that sort of Infected?

Infected Citizen:
Well...

Infected Citizen:
You know how the power went out in the neighborhood last month.

Grani:
Oh! Yep, the case of some bad actor wrecking the community's generators, right? But we've never found the culprit...

Grani:
I did hear the supply got restored in no time, though. Did someone fix all the generators up?

Infected Citizen:
Right! I heard they got this incredible engineering Caster in, and in a few hours, they already had the generators repaired! Question is, when did the community ever have an engineer so great?

Grani:
Right... something's definitely odd about that...

November 20th, 1097, 6:44 P.M.

Grani:
Here's my work report for today. If you could give it a look over, guv'nor.

Guards' Captain:
Hm. Two robberies, an inquiry report on rumors in Caladon... You must be pulling my leg.

Guards' Captain:
What about the burglary at Count Bishmer's?! How long do you think it's been? Get on it!

Grani:
Um—isn't that one only a day old...?

Guards' Captain:
Is a day not enough?!

Grani:
But...

Guards' Captain:
I broke my back getting you as a temporary transfer. The Mounted Police were singing your praises as an investigator. And for what? A day's worth of time isn't enough for you? For one tiny case of property theft?!

Grani:
(Under her breath) It was the City Council who borrowed me from the Mounted Police...

Guards' Captain:
Enough! You don't know respect, you talk back to your senior! Is this how the Mounted Police behave?!

Grani:
I'm sorry, guv'nor!

Guards' Captain:
'Investigated entranceways of abandoned structures. Turned out to be as suspicious as thought, inquired with surrounding residents...' What the hell is this?! Weren't you told you could leave this be?

Guards' Captain:
Caladon City gets strange business day in, day out, and wherever else the bloody day feels like! If every one of the Guards was as suspicious as you, we'd all be dead from the stress!

Grani:
But, guv'nor, if we let this all lie, then there's a real chance...

Guards' Captain:
Stop with the rubbish, get out and investigate!

Grani:
Yes, guv'nor!

November 22nd, 1097, 10:20 A.M.

Grani:
*Pant*...

Grani:
Li'l~ Susie~

Grani:
Let me give your ears a good rubbie-rub!

Susie:
Hahaha! What's the matter, Officer Grani?

Quercus:
Something at work, I imagine.

Grani:
*Sigh*... Nothing much, just some hiccups lately with my job.

Quercus:
Go on, what exactly's happening?

Grani:
It's not that big, to be honest...

Grani:
You've all heard the recent rumors in the city, I'm guessing.

Susie:
Ah, you mean those urban legends in the paper?

Quercus:
Same as ever, I assume. 'Sounds can be heard from the city underground,' 'criminals have infiltrated the Infected community,' and so on.

Grani:
Right... I was wanting to investigate those. I wrote up a dedicated report over the past few days.

Grani:
But the Guards don't care about any of it! They want me to keep my nose out of things!

Susie:
Eh? Do the Mounted Police investigate urban legends, too?

Grani:
Come on, that's the wrong idea, Susie!

Grani:
My work experience taught me that when these rumors crop up in a city, usually they come from the criminal activity that hides behind it.

Grani:
Like the 'sounds from underground' one.

Grani:
Did you know? There's massive runs of logistics channels lying abandoned under Caladon.

Quercus:
Right. In the earlier years, back when the nomadic sectors were being planned, they drafted plenty of channels through the structural layers. But following the city's development, a lot of the old plates' underground ways were too taxing to maintain, so they relinquished them all.

Grani:
Yep. For example, plenty of them run under the Infected community.

Grani:
Do you get it now? If those rumors are true, then that means there are people doing something at evening in those empty logistics channels, out of sight.

Susie:
Er... this is a bit scary, isn't it?

Grani:
It's too bad I still don't have any direct proof.

Quercus:
I think you can worry yourself a little less about it. It's meant to be the Guards' job, after all.

Quercus:
If something does happen later, they're the layabouts. You've got nothing to fear.

Grani:
Well, if you put it that way...

Grani:
*Sigh* It's patrol hours right now, so I guess I'm a layabout myself, sitting here...

Susie:
Hahaha... we won't tell anyone.

Grani:
Li'l~ Susie~

Grani:
Let me give your ears a good rubbie-rub!

Susie:
Go ahead, but careful of the static, okay?

November 24th, 1097, 6:15 P.M.

In front of the shambles of the 'Green Spark' stands a thunderstruck Officer Grani.

Before her eyes was that shop full of human warmth—now, with its roof collapsed, walls crumbled, and nothing left but charred black wreckage.

She stares blankly at the ruins in front of her, not daring to believe her eyes.

Grani:
...But why?

Grani:
Wh... why? Why would...?

Fire Brigade Member:
Oh, Miss Grani, you're here now?

Grani:
Wh-What happened here? Why is this place...?

Fire Brigade Member:
Too much for me to swallow, too. It could only be out of revenge, setting a place like this alight.

Grani:
Setting?! Someone set this place on fire?!

Grani:
What about the owner here? Where's that Feline girl? Have you seen her?

Fire Brigade Member:
No, we haven't, but no one was in there last night when the fire went up.

Fire Brigade Member:
We're lucky no one's burnt, or worse.

Grani:
Who the hell did this?!

Anger.

She clenches her fists tight.

The pub she visits practically every week, the adorable owner lady, the diverting guests... A moment of rare respite in this city, now turned to charred rubble.

The anger flooding Grani's mind is hard to keep in check—rarely is she ever this enraged.

She's reached the point of wanting to bring justice to the culprit herself, no matter who it is.

Fire Brigade Member:
Hey! No going in! We still haven't cleaned up the debris yet!

Grani:
That's fine, I'm looking over the scene of the crime. I might find something in this.

Fire Brigade Member:
Don't bother, officer.

Fire Brigade Member:
The Guards came over this morning. They looked all around, called it an accident, and left just like that.

Grani:
An accident? But didn't you just say...?

Fire Brigade Member:
That's just my opinion as a firefighter. We see a lot of things wherever we're called, and this we've seen.

Grani:
What's this... a scrap of explosive?

Fire Brigade Member:
Yeah, but the Guards had us keep out of this, so I didn't say much.

Fire Brigade Member:
And nobody cares, really... about the Infected community. It's all less said, the better.

Grani:
Can you pass this evidence on to me?

Fire Brigade Member:
Sure, it was burning my hand, anyway. Didn't think I should hold it... and you're with the Guards, at any rate.

Grani:
Let me see...

Grani:
Wait, hold on... these are shards from a military-grade incendiary! I've seen this sort back in Mounted Police training.

Grani:
Is it just me, or... are these shards familiar?

November 26th, 1097, 7:15 A.M.

Grani:
So we meet again, Mr. Maud?

Loud-Mouthed Man:
Th... The Mount?!

Grani:
Did they just let you go? I thought they'd keep you in custody for longer than this.

Loud-Mouthed Man:
Don't take me in again, officer, I'm begging you! All I am's a handyman!

Loud-Mouthed Man:
I haven't bothered about with those Infected in recent, I swear!

Grani:
Are you sure?

Grani:
Do you still remember that incendiary we confiscated from your loot, a few days ago when I arrested you?

Loud-Mouthed Man:
......

Grani:
You said you'd only bought one for 'self-defense'.

Grani:
But military-grade bomb shells have a very obvious unique design. They're not hard to identify even when shattered. Can you guess where I found this little piece?

Grani:
If you're lying, it's another trip with me back to the Guards.

Loud-Mouthed Man:
No! I'll tell you! Anything you want!

Loud-Mouthed Man:
I bought a case, I confess it! I bought a case! But I sold it all on to other people!

Loud-Mouthed Man:
The Danton brothers! I sold it to the Danton brothers!

Grani:
The Danton brothers? Who are they?

Loud-Mouthed Man:
Those two Siracusan immigrants! The two mafia henchmen! Go ask the people at the Boil! They know 'em!

Grani:
Then do you know why they'd want to burn down an Infected community pub?

Loud-Mouthed Man:
I don't know! I swear, no idea! I didn't hear a thing about the pub!

Loud-Mouthed Man:
I got the firebombs from the—the black market at the Boil, too! I swear, that's the honest truth!

Loud-Mouthed Man:
But the merchant there said, he's got ways of getting goods done directly at the factory...

Grani:
(Factories in Caladon... I think there's only Count Bishmer's manufacturing military supplies...)

Grani:
Do you know where the Danton brothers are?

Loud-Mouthed Man:
I... I'm not 100%, I just know they always hang around in the Boil...

Grani:
The Boil, huh...

November 27th, 1097, 6:15 P.M.

Guards' Captain:
How many times have I had to tell you? Have you caught the burglar?! Have you finished your patrols?! Only you Mounted Police sideshow jugglers would obsess over the tiniest meaningless business.

Grani:
You call this meaningless business?

Guards' Captain:
Is it not?! Is a single Infected community pub burning down worth you spending three days to investigate?

Guards' Captain:
A short-circuit in the mains, offended a gang, a lightning strike! I can think of a hundred other reasons still. Once you finally discover there was no culprit at all, who takes responsibility for all the cases this has held up? You?

Grani:
......

Grani:
So what about this evidence? These military incendiaries were made at Councilor Bishmer's factory, and were meant as supplies for the Victorian Army! But they circulated into the black market!

Grani:
Doesn't this warrant investigating that factory?!

Guards' Captain:
That's Count Bishmer's estate! You're saying you'll sweep a Member of the Council's factory?

Guards' Captain:
You've got some brass!

Grani:
Military incendiaries! The underground black market! The evidence is all in front of you! Why are you still playing the idiot here?

Grani:
Don't tell me, you get a piece of these black market deals too?

Guards' Captain:
You...! Do you know what you're saying? You dare tell me this to my face?!

Grani:
Who do you think you're fooling? Count Bishmer's your own relative, isn't he?

Guards' Captain:
You... you!

Grani:
How did someone like you get into the position of Captain of the Guards?

Grani:
You don't have a care in you for Infected community cases, and you turn a blind eye when gangs from the Boil cause disaster. And now you're not going to look into something this massive?

Grani:
Then what IS your job? You've abandoned your duties!

Grani:
Is there still anyone in the Caladon Guards qualified to enforce the law?

Guards' Captain:
So you're going to mutiny?

Grani:
I'm a Mounted Police Officer on temporary transfer here by the City Council! Right now, I'm the one in charge of the Mounted Police of Caladon City—you and I are of the same rank! You should have no authority to order me!

Guards' Captain:
Fine, then! I just knew you bumpkin lot would...

Guards' Captain:
You wait. You just wait until the Duke's back from Londinium. I'll report to him in full detail just the kind of attitude you 'Mounted Police' bring to your work!

Grani:
Suit yourself! Goodbye!

Guards' Captain:
Lowly circus spectacles, damned backwater blood... You wait until the Duke's back! You'll get your damn dues!

November 28th, 1097, 7:15 P.M.

White House Pub, The Boil, Caladon

Imposing Black-Suit:
What are they doin'? That sets us back a whole day!

Sly Black-Suit:
You think it's some kinda slip-up at the factory?

Imposing Black-Suit:
Then what do we do now?

Sly Black-Suit:
We hold on a little longer... If we still don't get news by this evening, we dip out, pronto.

Barman:
Is there anything I can do for you?

Grani:
Evening, I'm looking for two people they call 'the Danton Brothers' and I've heard some say they see them come by this pub sometimes...

Imposing Black-Suit:
Shit! What got the Guards in here?

Sly Black-Suit:
Don't panic! We're in the Boil, what's she gonna try?

Grani:
Ha! Found you!

Imposing Black-Suit:
So, what does, ah... a fine Mounted Police Officer want with a pair of law-abiding brothers?

Grani:
I'll need you to come with me to the Guards about a case of arson in the Infected neighborhood, early morning on the 24th. I have a few questions I'd like to ask.

Sly Black-Suit:
And if we politely decline?

Grani:
Please, comply with law enforcement's work, Mr. Danton.

Barman:
Easy there, Mount! This is the Boil you're in. Your word isn't law here.

Barman:
Get out. You're not welcome at my bar.

In an instant, the atmosphere in the pub begins to strain. A few bruisers with vicious looks rise from their seats.

They pull out weapons, eyeing the pint-sized officer with malice.

Sly Black-Suit:
Hahaha, this is Caladon's Boil, signora. You fancy coppers don't fit in here.

Sly Black-Suit:
Go on back to helping the Infected scrub their chamber pots. That sounds about right for you.

Grani:
*Sigh*.

Grani:
(Nine people... I've got plenty to write once the report comes...)

November 28th, 1097, 7:50 P.M.

Streets of Caladon

Sly Black-Suit:
Motor it! Quick, she's right behind us!

Imposing Black-Suit:
My hand's broken!

Sly Black-Suit:
Suck it up and keep runnin'! This Mount's crazy!

Imposing Black-Suit:
We can't beat that shit! Are they all like her?!

Sly Black-Suit:
Save it! Go for the Infected ghetto, the layout's all screwy there, we still got a chance!

Imposing Black-Suit:
Did we shake her?

Sly Black-Suit:
Shut up, keep it down!

Sly Black-Suit:
She didn't see us. We hide here, we're gold.

Imposing Black-Suit:
Son of a bitch, something's wrong with this Mount. How the hell did she even find us?

Sly Black-Suit:
You save your breath.

Little 'Witch' Minnie:
Who are... you?

Sly Black-Suit:
Huh?!

Imposing Black-Suit:
Where'd the brat come from?!

Little 'Witch' Minnie:
This is Miss Witch's house. What are you doing in here?

Sly Black-Suit:
Shut her up! The Mount's right outside!

Imposing Black-Suit:
Stupid little punk, I oughta...

Little 'Witch' Minnie:
I get it! You're bad people!

The immature witch extends her right hand, and a purple thunderbolt leaps from it.

Grani:
(Shoot, where'd they run?)

Grani:
Hello... can I ask if you've seen—

Just as the Kuranta officer starts talking to a nearby resident, two men dressed in black fly out from the window of a building not far away, hitting a wall with two heavy thuds.

Sly Black-Suit:
Hot-hot-hot! Little shit!

Imposing Black-Suit:
Cavolo, stupid Infected, I'm gonna get her...

Grani:
Great! So this is where you two holed up.

Sly Black-Suit:
Shit! Cheese it!

Imposing Black-Suit:
Where the hell to?!

Sly Black-Suit:
The abandoned section! There's a safehouse there!

November 28th, 1097, 8:59 P.M.

Disused border sector of Caladon

The two black-suits huff and gasp as they run through the deserted streets.

And the pint-sized Kuranta officer is hot on their tails.

Sly Black-Suit:
I think we lost her.

Imposing Black-Suit:
My ass we lost her! You think you can lose a Kuranta officer in the city? Keep running!

Sly Black-Suit:
How much farther?

Imposing Black-Suit:
Almost there! Right up front.

Sly Black-Suit:
Made it. In here.

Imposing Black-Suit:
Our contact was here? This safehouse is shot to hell!

Sly Black-Suit:
Save it. They said they'd ready up any clothes and fake IDs for skipping town, put 'em here. There's a hidden passage through the old logistics channels. We'll find a way to slip out.

Grani:
Hiding in a building, huh. Not planning to give up?

Grani:
Don't test my patience, alright? We're on the edge of the city. You can't fall back any further now.

Grani:
And let me remind you two, hiding in that building to ambush me isn't going to do anything for you, okay?

Grani:
Keep resisting, and you'll only keep piling on the charges against you.

Grani:
Put down the crossbows and bombs, and surrender this instant.

Sly Black-Suit:
What the hell, where is everybody? The lights are dead?!

Imposing Black-Suit:
This room's a goddamned mess! What's all that piled on the ground? I can't even tell.

Sly Black-Suit:
You just knocked something over! What the hell's that smell?!

Imposing Black-Suit:
It's too dark! I can't see anything!

Sly Black-Suit:
Why'd they pile up all this crap? They tryin' to pull something?

Imposing Black-Suit:
This stinks to high heaven! Where's our contact?!

Sly Black-Suit:
I don't like this! This building ain't right!

Grani:
If you still won't come out, I'll have to break in by force.

Grani:
About time you witnessed a Mounted Officer's true strength.

The pint-sized officer reverse grips her pike and lowers her body. She lifts it over her head, Originium Arts coalescing at its tip, the pike wholly bathed in a dark red luster in the black of the night.

Grani:
I haven't used this maneuver in a long, long time. Don't blame me if anyone gets hurt, alright?

Imposing Black-Suit:
Do something! She's gonna break down the door!

Sly Black-Suit:
Don't panic! Calm down!

Sly Black-Suit:
Flashlight! You got it or not?

Imposing Black-Suit:
What kind of mook carries a goddamned flashlight around?

Sly Black-Suit:
The firebombs! You had one left, right?

Imposing Black-Suit:
You gonna burn the place down?

Sly Black-Suit:
Dumbass! You throw the bomb in there first, we escape before the fire spreads! The house goes up, and that beat cop ain't gonna follow us! Two fowls, one stone!

Imposing Black-Suit:
Makes sense! Let me see...

The imposing black-suit pulls the ring on an incendiary meant for military use, and tosses it into the depths of the pitch-black room.

However—

The moment the flare lights up is the moment they finally realize just how stupid a decision they've made.

Within the cramped, dilapidated room sits a great pile of Originium explosives and hazardous chemicals.

The bucket they knocked over earlier was filled with high-concentration raw keton, now spilled all across the floor.

Grani:
I'm going to count from three, and that's your final chance!

Grani:
Three!

Grani:
Two!

Grani:
One!

The collapsible military pike shoots forth like lightning, smashing apart at least ten centimeters' worth of concrete wall and tearing through the structure.

But in the following instant...

The sound of an explosion as grand as thunder rolls across the entirety of Caladon.

Harsh firelight follows a mushroom cloud straight into the skies, shining over the abandoned plate, through the Gododdin night, and across the southwest harbors of Victoria.

In the wake of the cabin's explosion, the surrounding ground caves in entirely, crashing down to the city plate's structural layer.

And that layer being in deep disrepair, it continues its collapse, dropping down and down, letting out an unending rumbling roar.

Where the cabin once stood now resembles a direct strike from a high-speed battleship bombardment. Only a massive pit filled with thick smoke remains to tell the tale.

The suspects, the evidence, and the truth are all blown away into the black smog along with the abandoned building, trailing high and away with the wind.

Grani:
......???

Grani:
Wh... What happened?!

Blown head over heels by the shockwave, the Victorian Mounted Officer now stares in bewilderment at the entire sight before her. Nothing that just happened has processed for her yet.

November 28th, 1097.

Nighttime in Caladon City finds itself exceptionally lively.
