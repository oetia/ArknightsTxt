November 16th, 1097, 9:50 P.M.

Nine in the evening is when the Infected factory nearby changes shifts.

Many of the workmen choose to kill time by paying Miss Quercus's shop a visit.

There is not much the shop has to offer to its patrons.

A crude fried fin cutlet, a bowl of tasteless potato soup, and a mug of fruit-wine-flavored water.

And yet, the shop has garnered a few regulars.

James the Worker:
Cheers!

Stone the Infected:
Cheers!

James the Worker:
Hahahaha! Here's to Brande!

Stone the Infected:
Hey, Sparky! Another pint!

Susie:
Here you go. Your fruit wine.

Susie:
So what's going on? Why's everybody so cheery?

James the Worker:
Mr. Brande just gave us all a bonus along with our payslips for the month!

Stone the Infected:
They say it's a bonus, but it's just a hundred pence.

Stone the Infected:
And considering they work us to the bone, that's the least they could owe us.

Stone the Infected:
You sure you should be here at this hour, though? Might get a beating from the missus?

James the Worker:
Jog on! I'm the king of the castle! She wouldn't dare!

Stone the Infected:
Alright. Here's to the king of the castle!

James the Worker:
Cheers!

James the Worker:
Hey, Sparky! Another pint!

Susie:
Hahaha... Mr. James, you really should watch your drink, though. We wouldn't want to upset Mrs. James.

Stone the Infected:
Sparky, I heard from your boss you've got something stronger than this piss?

Stone the Infected:
Get us some of that!

Susie:
Not! Happening!

Susie:
Remember what Miss Quercus told you. Strong drink is bad for your condition!

Susie:
You need to take better care of yourself, Stone.

Stone the Infected:
Come on, what's the problem?

Stone the Infected:
This disease is a death sentence. Might as well get a taste of the hard stuff before we cark...

Susie:
Don't say that!

Susie:
The doctors in the city told us! Oripathy progresses differently depending on the patient's physical condition!

Stone the Infected:
Lighten up, I'm just...

Susie:
Stone!

Stone the Infected:
Um... Yeah?

Susie:
Take care of yourself and live life to the fullest! Stop saying that word all the time!

Stone the Infected:
Er... Sorry?

James the Worker:
Look at you. You got Sparky upset.

Stone the Infected:
*Sigh*, I didn't mean to...

Bitter Root:
Huh? Looks like we've got quite a crowd here today.

Susie:
Good evening, Mr. Root!

Stone the Infected:
Oi, if it isn't Bitter Root! Come on, come on! Let's drink!

Bitter Root:
Huh? Something to celebrate today?

Caladon's Infected community is home to many a peculiar man, and Bitter Root counts among them.

Mr. Root works for an organization called Rhodes Island. He's a 'professional' hired by the lords of the city council.

But the way Rhodes Island treats the Infected boggles the mind.

'Rhodes Island will assist the Caladon City Council and provide medical assistance to all Infected,' said their public address.

Why would anyone willingly help the Infected... especially when they're not even from here?

James the Worker:
How's work today, Bitt? T'ain't often you get the free time to come for a drink.

Bitter Root:
It's fine. We hired a few extra pair of hands. Things calmed down quite a bit, thanks to them.

James the Worker:
Eh? Is it that good working for Rhodes Island? Do they pay well?

Bitter Root:
What of it? You interested?

James the Worker:
Nah, forget I said anything. I can't even read... I'd just be making a fool of myself.

At first, no one in the Infected community trusted them. There were even rumors that they were here to take the late-stage Infected away for experiments.

But Rhodes Island proved themselves with their actions. They really are here to help.

Be it a regular Oripathy infection checkup, acute Oripathy attack treatment, or even just a normal workplace injury, you just walk into their clinic, and they'll help you.

Even right here, right now, there are those who have doubts about Rhodes Island's true motives. But at the very least, all of the pub's regulars trust them.

Bitter Root:
By the way, Jim, I saw your wife on my way here.

James the Worker:
What? What?? You sure?! Oh, bugger...

James the Worker:
Ahem.

James the Worker:
Er... You carry on with the drinks. I... I just remembered I've got a few errands to run. See you around!

Stone the Infected:
Hahaha, there goes our 'king of the castle!'

James the Worker:
Yeah, yeah, off I go. We'll do this another time.

Susie:
Be safe on your way home, Mr. James.

Unlike most of the people in the establishment, Mr. James is not Infected.

In Caladon, it isn't uncommon to find non-Infected working in the Infected community.

Ever since the 'New Caladon Infected Act' came into place, a lot of the unemployed poor have been risking themselves working in the Infected factories.

A great majority of them leave the Infected community as soon as they get off work. They also avoid coming into direct contact with the Infected during working hours.

That's understandable. All of us Infected have gotten used to the attitude, and no one blames the non-Infected workmen for it.

Though, still, there are people like Mr. James.

Stone the Infected:
*Sigh*. There goes my drinking buddy.

Stone the Infected:
Come on, Bean, stop spacing out over there. Have a few pints with me.

Bean the Infected:
Quiet down. I'm reading the newspaper.

Stone the Infected:
What's the headlines?

Bean the Infected:
It's all been big news the last couple of days! The whole town's talking about it. Don't tell me you haven't heard!

Bitter Root:
The new bill, is it? That's some big news, indeed.

Stone the Infected:
What new bill?

Bean the Infected:
The one that's going to improve how us Infected workers are treated! Do you ever do anything except drink? This bill's going to be massive for all of us!

Stone the Infected:
Peh, and here I thought it was something that actually mattered.

Stone the Infected:
You're naive, you know? I gave up on that hokum long ago.

Bean the Infected:
What, you don't want them to start treating us better?

Stone the Infected:
You think the lords actually care about us Infected? On your bike!

Stone the Infected:
I guarantee you, this bill thing's bound to fail. It'll be unanimous, even. And then it'll be like nothing ever happened.

Stone the Infected:
They're doing this just for show, I tell you.

Bean the Infected:
Aha! Too bad, then! You're wrong.

Bean the Infected:
The bill didn't pass, but it didn't fail either.

Bean the Infected:
It was a tie. The final decision's going to have to wait till next time.

Stone the Infected:
I'm still not buying it. It won't pass. What does the paper say, though? What's in that bill, specifically?

Bean the Infected:
One second. Let's see... I remember some bits and pieces of it back when they announced it.

Bean the Infected:
Oh, take a look. It says here that Infected workers cannot work more than fifteen hours a day, that the factories have to give the Infected the same kinds of Originium protective equipment as non-Infected...

Stone the Infected:
Pfft. Don't make me laugh.

Stone the Infected:
There's a snowball's chance that's true. What's that saying again? There's no pies in the sky?

Stone the Infected:
What would you outlanders even know? Me, I'm a born-and-bred Caladonian. I've seen how they do things my whole life. No one knows the nobles how I do.

Stone the Infected:
You're still counting on those stingy tosspots to do anything for you out of their pockets? Dream on.

Bean the Infected:
*Sigh*... You want to at least hold out some hope... Keep a positive outlook on things.

Bitter Root:
There's no need to be so negative. Who could've thought ten years ago that they'd pass that New Caladonian Infected Act, right?

Stone the Infected:
Now that, that's apples to oranges.

Stone the Infected:
Us Infected can work their factories, and the heads only have to pay us half the money. They get to pocket the other half! Of course they passed that bill!

Bean the Infected:
That's true. Oftentimes, they don't even pay us with cash, just Wage Tickets.

Bitter Root:
Things take time. I think you could be more optimistic about this.

Bitter Root:
Keep in mind that Caladon willingly accepts Infected from all the cities out there, and even offers work. You don't see that anywhere else in Victoria.

Bean the Infected:
I heard from some of the foremen these policies are... what... 'Columbian-style?'

Bean the Infected:
Are all the Columbian cities like this?

Bitter Root:
Well... It's complicated. There's a tiny bit of difference.

Stone the Infected:
Whatever, time for a new topic. Any other news?

Bean the Infected:
Let's see...

Bean the Infected:
'Terror in Caladon! Loud Roars Heard Underground at Night!'

Bean the Infected:
And then... 'Possible Infected Smuggling Activity Spotted in Abandoned Districts in Caladon Outskirts.'

Bean the Infected:
Then there's also this... 'Public Safety in Jeopardy, Convicts and Wanted Criminals Have Infiltrated the Infected Community.'

Susie:
Why are all the headlines like that?

Stone the Infected:
That's the 'Caladon Daily' and their rubbish reporting for you. They love their terrorizing headlines, and they take care to add the word 'Infected' in there. Just talking about those hack journos makes me want to puke.

Bitter Root:
It's true, but you should still be careful, Susie. Caladon hasn't been all that safe lately.

Susie:
Hahaha... I'll watch out. Thanks.

November 17th, 1097, 8:40 A.M.

Susie:
Fin fillets, potatoes, green onions... I guess that's about it?

Susie:
Oh, and the pepper, too!

Susie:
I just have to deliver these to Mr. Kells, right?

Citizen:
Yes, please.

Susie:
On my way!

Protester:
Foreigners go home!

Protester:
Out with the Infected! This is our home!!

Loud-Mouthed Man:
Out with the Infected!

Loud-Mouthed Man:
It's the Infected's fault us porters lost all our jobs!

It's not uncommon to find people protesting the Infected community here in Caladon.

When the city council passed the New Caladonian Infected Act four years ago, a large group of Infected migrated to the city for work all at once.

But the hostility between the non-Infected and the Infected didn't improve.

Loud-Mouthed Man:
Hey, you! The Infected there! Get over here!

Susie:
I-I'm just walking past...

Loud-Mouthed Man:
What's that you're holding? Eh?

Susie:
It's just...

Loud-Mouthed Man:
What's that in your basket! Let me see it!

Susie:
These are items I'm delivering to a customer!

Loud-Mouthed Man:
Shouldn't your lot be working in the factories right now? What are you wandering around here for?!

Susie:
It's part of my job to deliver things too...

Loud-Mouthed Man:
Who said you could talk back?!

Susie:
Urgh...

Susie:
(Ouch...)

Susie:
Spark... Arts...

Susie:
(Bear with it, Susie... Don't fight back...)

Susie:
(This isn't the first time something like this has happened...)

Loud-Mouthed Man:
What gives you Infected the right to walk the streets in broad daylight anyway?

Loud-Mouthed Man:
It's all your fault the air here has gotten so polluted!

Loud-Mouthed Man:
Bunch of pests! Go back to the sewers, where you belong!

Susie:
(But you're the one who came to the Infected community...)

Loud-Mouthed Man:
What? What are you looking at me for? Looking for a fight?!

Red:
That's enough, mister. Let's not overdo it.

Loud-Mouthed Man:
And who are you?

The tall, masked man helps the Feline girl up and turns around to face the thug.

Red:
There's no reason to lay hands on an unarmed lady now. It's not a very honorable thing to do, wouldn't you agree?

Loud-Mouthed Man:
What? She's just an Infected!

Loud-Mouthed Man:
And what's with you? Trying to be a hero?

Loud-Mouthed Man:
Well? If you want some, come and get it!

Red:
......

Loud-Mouthed Man:
Coward.

Susie:
Mr. Red!

Red:
Hmph.

Red:
I'm afraid I don't have what it takes to offend you, kind sir.

Red:
Though before you continue, I should inform you that I have Originium crystals on my face, and your punch landed right on one.

Loud-Mouthed Man:
W-What...?

Red:
Oh, sir, this isn't good. Look, I'm bleeding out of my mouth, and your hand is injured.

Red:
It might just get you infected too.

Loud-Mouthed Man:
What?! But...!

Protester:
Hurry! To the hospital! You can still make it!

Loud-Mouthed Man:
Damn you, Ursus! You'd better watch your back! You'll regret this!

Protester:
Enough now! Get to the hospital!

Susie:
Um, thanks... Mr. Red.

Susie:
A-Are you okay?

Red:
Don't worry about me. I'm used to taking a beating.

Red:
I could ask you the same. Look at your face. It's all swollen.

Susie:
I-I'm okay... I'll put some ice on it when I get home.

Red:
There've been more anti-Infected protests here lately. You should avoid this area on your way back.

Red:
Where are you headed? I'll go with you.

Susie:
Thanks, but don't you have work? I wouldn't want to be a bother...

Red:
Don't worry yourself. I have errands in the area too.

Mr. Red works at a nearby factory, and he visits the shop sometimes.

He may be from Ursus, but he doesn't like to drink. He prefers to read a book in the shop all by himself.

The other workers seem to really respect him. They all call him 'the bossman'.

Susie:
But... Mr. Red, is that man really going to catch Oripathy?

Red:
Of course not. You don't just get infected like that. I was only scaring him.

Red:
Oripathy can spread through blood, but he only had some minor scrapes.

Red:
It's pretty effective as a bluff, though.

Susie:
Hahaha, I see.

James the Worker:
Those bastards... What a lot of utter scumbags!

James the Worker:
Laying hands on a young lady? Have they no shame?

Susie:
Don't get yourself all worked up. I'm okay.

Grani:
So they ran off after they hit you? Did you see where they went?

Red:
They ran north, so my guess is they headed to the Boil.

Grani:
The Boil, eh? It won't be easy to find them, then.

Grani:
In any case, I'll make a note. They've been fairly short staffed at the Guards lately.

Grani:
Does your face still hurt? Need me to massage it a bit?

Susie:
Haha... It's okay. Don't worry about me, Officer Grani.

Grani:
It's true how Caladon hasn't been that safe lately... but I didn't expect you to get attacked, Susie.

Officer Grani isn't with the local Caladon Guards. She's a Mounted Police officer temporarily loaned to the local guards and assigned to the Infected community.

Of course, the Caladon Guards aren't very interested in keeping the Infected safe. This 'short staffed' business seems to be an excuse, too.

Which makes Officer Grani one of very few local law enforcement officers willing to help the Infected.

Though just the few of them alone... can't solve all of the community's safety problems.

Grani:
No loss of property... and that's filed. This is all I can do for you right now.

Grani:
I'm off now. Come find me if there's any more trouble.

Susie:
Thank you, Officer Grani.

Stone the Infected:
The idiots better hope I don't find them first.

Red:
What if you do find them?

Stone the Infected:
I'll beat the life out of them!

Red:
Think, Stone. The moment you lay a finger, everyone around will start screaming and making a fuss.

Red:
Then, the next morning, the front page of 'Caladon Daily' will read 'Infected Batters Innocent Citizen, Security Problems Worse by the Day.'

Stone the Infected:
Well...

Red:
And I remember that rotten boy and his loud mouth.

Red:
A month ago, he was protesting the crowd in overalls, complaining how the factory he worked at was shut down because of the Infected.

Red:
Two months ago, he protested with the hawkers and said the Infected stole his merchandise.

Red:
So what is he today?

Susie:
I think he said he was a 'porter'?

Stone the Infected:
What in the world!

Bean the Infected:
Sounds like something the gangs of the Boil would do. He was probably hired. Now which lord did we offend again?

Red:
The Infected community's always been a thorn in the side of certain people. As long as the councilors who support the new bill aren't in the majority, these things will keep happening.

Red:
We'd better keep our eyes peeled.

Stone the Infected:
This prick, though... Forget Susie. He even tried to fight you, bossman, and how dare he!

Red:
Alright, enough. Your pint's getting lonely.

James the Worker:
*Sigh*... How am I supposed to drink, knowing our little Sparky got harassed?

Susie:
Hahaha, you're just exaggerating.

Bean the Infected:
Sparky, take this.

Susie:
Huh? What is it?

Bean the Infected:
It's an ointment that helps reduce swelling. Anywhere it hurts, just rub some on there after you wash your face tonight.

Stone the Infected:
Huh? Now how come you're not giving me some of that?

Bean the Infected:
This is from Yan! You know how expensive it is? Besides, look how rough you are! What do you need it for?!

Susie:
Oh... If it's that expensive, I can't take it.

Bean the Infected:
No, do. Best not work a pub with a swollen face.

Susie:
Hahaha... This isn't exactly a pub, though...

Susie:
Thanks, Mr. Bean.

Susie:
In that case, your drinks are on the house tonight.

Stone the Infected:
Now that's what I'm talking about!

Exhausted Woman:
Susie, are you sure you have to go?

Susie:
Yes, Mum... Staying here... isn't going to do any of us any good.

Exhausted Woman:
No, Susie, listen to me... I found another job this month. Don't worry about the medicine. We'll figure something out!

Susie:
Please don't... I can't be a burden on the family anymore, not when my baby brother and sister still have school. And when my big brothers are all still healthy.

Exhausted Woman:
I can't let my daughter go to another city alone!

Susie:
Don't worry about me. I heard how the Infected working in Caladon get medicine as part of their pay.

Exhausted Woman:
I'm sorry... It's all my fault, Susie... I'm so sorry.

Susie:
I'll take care of myself. Don't worry, Mum.

November 18th, 1097, 9:20 A.M.

Every now and then, I dream of my family.

I was born in Boschendal, a small town at the northern edge of Victoria.

When I was little, back when my father was still alive, he would take our whole family out to picnics.

When you're up on Mount Shay, gazing out into the distance, you can even see the vast Kazimierzian Plains.

It's been five years since the last time I went home, but my mother still sends me letters.

My family's situation has taken a turn for the better since I left. It was difficult to pay all the expenses an Infected needs with just my mother and my brothers' income.

They're living a better life, and that's more than enough for me.

Susie:
Welcome!

Quercus:
Look who's here!

Susie:
Huh? Hi, boss!

Quercus:
Li'l~ Susie~

Quercus:
Let me give your ears a good rub!

Susie:
Hahaha... boss... that tickles!

Quercus:
Boss again? Come on, don't be such a stranger!

Susie:
Hahaha... Miss Quercus.

Quercus:
Hm?

Susie:
Quercus...

Quercus:
That's more like it!

Quercus is a free-spirit, and also the owner of the shop.

Although most people here treat it like a pub, it's actually Quercus's arboretum and lighting shop.

Many have asked us why she would open such a shop in the Infected community.

And her answer has always been a very simple one.

Quercus:
Why open a lighting shop?

Quercus:
Because I want to.

That said, Quercus actually spends very little time in Caladon.

The shop seems only to be a hobby of hers. In other words, she really meant it when she said she wanted to. She mostly works as a Messenger, spending her time bustling about in the wilderness. Most people call her the 'Druid of Gododdin.'

By the way, Quercus's Arts are actually very unique. She plants all kinds of strange flora around the shop, and she brewed most of the alcohol we sell here herself.

She even gave me my staff and Arts Unit because they can apparently help me control my own Originium Arts.

Susie:
Why did you come back this time? Did you need something?

Quercus:
Oh? I'm not allowed to come see you without a special reason?

Susie:
Hahaha...

Quercus:
I have something to take care. What, have you forgotten? It's almost the end of the year!

Susie:
Oh, right...

This is a defining moment for me.

I've been saving up money for a few years now. I want to buy this place.

I want to have my own shop here in Caladon. No matter what I do, this will be the beginning of my independence.

And Quercus often tells me that the shop's landlord has been thinking about renting to someone else, and that she doesn't have much time to take care of it.

Quercus:
So you've saved up all this? That's amazing, Susie!

Susie:
But, Quercus... Are you sure it's okay? Isn't it a bit on the low side for a place like this?

Quercus:
How many times have you asked me that now? Do you not trust me?

Susie:
No, I mean... Of course I trust you.

Quercus:
I'll get you a meeting with the landlord sometime next week for you to work out the details. He's a dependable one.

Susie:
Next week, huh...?

November 18th, 1097, 9:56 P.M.

Susie:
Here's your tea, Miss Mountbelan.

Skyfire:
Thanks.

Ethelflaed Julie Mountbelan is one of our regulars. She's just Miss Mountbelan to us.

She's another of Rhodes Island's experts. She's in charge of coming up with solutions to solve Infected problems for the council.

Just like Mr. Root, she got along with our other customers straight away.

The Mountbelan name is known far and wide in the country, so I still haven't grown completely used to seeing a lady from such a prestigious family having tea around the Infected community.

Quercus:
Judging by your look, I suppose the lords did something to make you unhappy?

Miss Mountbelan takes a sip of tea. Both her lips and the blood vessels on her forehead are twitching.

Skyfire:
Can you believe it? Can you believe it?!

Skyfire:
I spent two weeks preparing all that data, and they only read a single page of it!

Skyfire:
Just one page!!

Skyfire:
How short-sighted can they be?! The issues I raised are urgent to the point they need addressing right now! You can't tell me it doesn't worry them one bit?!

Quercus:
Oh, they don't worry about the fire until it's started burning them.

Skyfire:
It this drags on, it'll immolate them completely.

Skyfire:
Hasn't the Reunion mayhem in Gododdin taught them anything?

Quercus:
The flames of Reunion Gododdin were stomped out two years ago. Why would it be a problem to these noble lords?

Skyfire:
Things aren't that simple, though! It's as though they don't even understand the crux of the matter! Reunion isn't just a band of thugs or bandits. There's a reason they started that uprising.

Stone the Infected:
Oi, is it just me or did it get warmer in here all of a sudden?

James the Worker:
Yeah, I think it did.

Quercus:
Not again. Cool it a little. Don't burn my store down.

Skyfire:
*Sigh*... Never mind.

Susie:
Hahaha... Calm down, Miss Mountbelan.

Susie:
You're off work. Try to keep a happier face on, I think.

Susie:
Here, give these a try.

Skyfire:
What do you have here... Sweets?

Susie:
That's right. Quercus made these vanilla mints herself. Let them calm your rage.

Skyfire:
*Sigh*... Thanks...

Skyfire:
I was on a holiday in Siesta just a few months ago... and now I'm starting to miss that place.

Susie:
It sounds like you've really had it tough, Miss Mountbelan. Loosen up some if you can.

Skyfire:
At least I have you lot to listen to me grumble here.

Susie:
You can't do that at Rhodes Island?

Skyfire:
You think my case is bad? Everyone has it tough there... Kicking up a fuss at work would only hurt morale.

James the Worker:
Don't worry, we're all a bunch of idiots. By the time you finish a sentence, we've gone and forgotten what you said.

Quercus:
So, what conclusion did the lords arrive at?

Skyfire:
Well, halfway through the meeting, they started fixating on all those silly rumors.

Quercus:
You mean like the 'sounds in the city underground' and 'criminals have infiltrated the Infected community?'

Bean the Infected:
In the end, it's all the Infected's fault, eh?

Skyfire:
Right, it's all just baseless conspiracy theories. It's a mystery to me who's even been spreading them.

Skyfire:
Anyway, the meeting devolved into a pointless shouting match after that.

James the Worker:
It sounds like a lot of the lords support the Infected community, though?

Bean the Infected:
We do solve a lot of their problems, after all. Some of the lords have made a good bit of dough over the last few years. Likelihood is they're just more amenable to it than most, considering they're directly profiting.

Quercus:
Besides, the community doesn't only concern the Infected anymore. There's plenty of non-Infected working here now, right?

James the Worker:
That's true. I'm one of them right here.

Skyfire:
Right, that's a fair point... but talking about it all here and now won't change a thing. I still have other engagements tomorrow, so if you'll excuse me.

Quercus:
Be careful out there.

Bean the Infected:
Now setting that aside...

Bean the Infected:
Why are you working here in our community, James? It's strange for me to say, but isn't it a bit risky, on shift with the Infected?

James the Worker:
Risky... eh?

James the Worker:
Tell you the truth, risks are, in the end, nothing more than an unknown. Putting food on the table, that's the immediate problem.

James the Worker:
If worse comes to worst, suppose I actually catch Oripathy, my family are still going to live better than if I didn't have a job.

James the Worker:
I've got two little mouths to feed. I can't just leave it to my wife to be the breadwinner. Besides, it's not like she makes much, selling scarves. We wouldn't be able to get by.

James the Worker:
My mum's got asthma. It costs an arm and a leg to treat. My dad's got some serious bone disease too. He can't even get out of bed.

James the Worker:
I don't have a choice. If only I could find better work...

Bean the Infected:
*Sigh*... How come it sounds like your life's more of a mess than mine?

Stone the Infected:
......

Bean the Infected:
Why're you so quiet today, Stone? Did something happen?

Stone the Infected:
*cough*... How old did James say his kids are again?

James the Worker:
One's eight, the other twelve. Why?

Stone the Infected:
No... No reason. Just thinking.

Bean the Infected:
Come on, if you've got something on your mind, just say it. It's not like we're strangers.

Susie:
Did you run into some kind of trouble, Stone?

Stone the Infected:
Trouble, huh...? *Sigh*.

Stone the Infected:
I-I got a letter from my wife. She said she'll come pay me a visit with our daughter.

Bean the Infected:
A daughter? You have a daughter?!

Susie:
Eh? I didn't know you were married!

Stone the Infected:
What?! Is it that strange to you?

Bean the Infected:
No, not like that. Just... an Infected having a kid...

Stone the Infected:
Oh, don't you worry about that. I caught Oripathy afterwards. My wife and daughter are fine.

Bean the Infected:
Isn't that a good thing? Why the long face?

James the Worker:
Right, you got Oripathy, and your wife didn't abandon you. Wish the missus cared about me like that.

Stone the Infected:
*Sigh*, look at me. How am I supposed to face them the way I am now?

Susie:
What's wrong with the way you are?

Bean the Infected:
Right, why look down on yourself like that?

Quercus:
It's true, though. You're not exactly in good shape to see her.

Quercus:
Why don't we get you a haircut? You could at least be a little better groomed?

Susie:
Alright! If it's a haircut Stone needs...

Susie:
(Brandishes a pair of scissors and a comb)

Stone the Infected:
Hold your beasties! You know how to cut hair, Sparky?

Quercus:
Now, don't underestimate her! My girl Susie's a master hairdresser.

Susie:
Ta-dah!

Quercus:
Well, doesn't that look pretty good?

Stone the Infected:
I don't usually cut it so short. Feels all breezy...

James the Worker:
Hey, you're looking fresh.

Susie:
I think you can do a lot for yourself if you pay just a little more attention to your hair, Stone.

Stone the Infected:
*Sigh*. Look at me, though. My life's a disaster. How am I supposed to find time to care about my hair?

Susie:
Don't think like that!

Susie:
It's because life's so hard that we should find our own ways to live better.

Quercus:
Right. No one's ever said the Infected have to live in misery.

Quercus:
Chin up. Your wife will be delighted to see you like this.

Bean the Infected:
Take it slow. You come to my room later.

Bean the Infected:
I've got some clean clothes I've been holding onto. Haven't worn them much. Give them a wash and see if they fit.

Stone the Infected:
Eh... You sure about that?

Bean the Infected:
What's to stand on ceremony? Just take them!

Bean the Infected:
Now come on, drink up!

November 23rd, 1097, 10:35 A.M.

Today's the day.

I'm meeting the landlord.

There's a thick stack of cash in front of me.

Six thousand, five hundred pounds. This amount of money was once unthinkable to me.

When I was little, one of my brothers broke an Originium lamp we had. Mum gave him a really good spanking.

That was the first time I saw her get that angry. She needed that lamp to patrol the mineshaft at night.

The lamp was worth a hundred and fifty pounds. It was almost her entire month's salary. That's what got her so angry.

How many Originium lamps could six thousand and five hundred pounds buy?

I assess the enormity of the heavy, foul-smelling pile of sacrifice before me.

All the meals I've skipped over the years. All the hardships I've suffered through.

Six thousand, five hundred pounds.

These sheets of paper are like a bridge I laid myself, brick by brick. On the other side stands my dreams.

Susie:
Susie! Get it together!

Susie:
You're just meeting with the landlord! He's just a landlord!

Susie:
From tomorrow onwards, you'll be the shop's owner! Your dream is coming true!

Susie:
You're almost there, Susie!

I look in the mirror and give my cheeks a good slap.

Susie:
How should I greet him?

Susie:
'Nice to meet you, sir! I'm very glad to...'

Susie:
No, the smile's too stiff.

My dream is about to come true, but I don't feel the least bit excited. On the contrary, I'm growing more and more afraid of seeing the man about to walk into the shop.

The landlord... What kind of a person is he?

Is he infected or not? Will he really sell the shop to me?

He's selling it to me so cheap. Could it be a scam?

Is he doing this because, like everyone else, he just wants to make fun of me, to humiliate me?

M-Maybe Quercus isn't Infected either... Maybe they're in on this together, just to...

Susie:
Ahhh! What am I thinking!

I smack my face hard.

I'm using pain to suppress these shameful, despicable emotions.

Susie:
Don't be like this, Susie! This is hideous!

I stare into the mirror. The only thing that can be heard inside the quiet shop is the clock's ticking.

It's like torture.

Quercus:
Susie! Are you there?

Susie:
Ehhh?!

Quercus:
Watch your Arts!

Quercus:
What's the matter with you? What are you so scared of? Did something happen?

Susie:
No... I'm okay! Good morning, Miss Quercus.

Quercus:
(Doubtful glare)

Quercus:
Look at those dark circles under your eyes!

Quercus:
What's wrong? Did you not sleep well?

Susie:
Hahaha... I was a little nervous.

Bitter Root:
Good morning, Miss Susie.

Susie:
Oh! Mr. Root! Sorry, I didn't see...

Susie:
Huh? What time is it?

Susie:
Oh, sorry, Mr. Root. We aren't open today. Did you need something?

Bitter Root:
You haven't told her yet, Quercus?

Quercus:
Oh, you're right. I haven't.

Susie:
Huh?

Quercus:
I forgot to mention it, but he's the landlord who owns the shop.

Susie:
Eh?

Susie:
Ehhh??

Susie:
Mr. Root's the landlord? So the previous owners signed their contracts with Mr. Root?!

Bitter Root:
It's a long story... Anyway, Rhodes Island actually owns this property.

Bitter Root:
I've heard the details from Quercus. Miss Susie, you want to buy the store, is that right?

Bitter Root:
Permit me to ask, then. What kind of business do you want to run here?

Susie:
Business?

Susie:
Oh! Business!

Susie:
......

Susie:
M-My father was a hairdresser.

Susie:
When I was little, he often said... we shouldn't change our attitude towards life just because we're poor.

Susie:
Hairdressing may seem trivial, but if someone's putting in the effort to keep themselves groomed, then they must still carry the will to live.

Susie:
That's why I thought...

Susie:
It would be nice... to open a hair salon in the Infected community.

Bitter Root:
Hairdressing, huh...? For the Infected?

Bitter Root:
That sounds very nice.

Bitter Root:
It's a deal, then! Someone will come to sort out the contract later.

Susie:
Eh? That's it?

Bitter Root:
We've known each other for a long time, haven't we? You'll be fine, Susie.

Susie:
My own shop... It feels like... I'm dreaming.

Susie:
That reminds me. Where will you go now, Miss Quercus? Are you going to leave the city?

Quercus:
Oh, don't look at me like that. It's not like I won't ever come back.

Quercus:
I'll stop by every now and then. I have lots of friends in town, you know?

Bitter Root:
Oh, and one last thing.

Bitter Root:
Susie, Quercus got you a little gift.

Susie:
A gift? Huh?

Quercus:
Come, Susie. Everyone's waiting for you.

Quercus:
Congratulations!

Grani:
You did it, Susie!

Susie:
Officer Grani! Why are you here?!

Stone the Infected:
Alright! Now Sparky's the owner! Make sure you keep the booze we like on the taps!

Red:
Congratulations, Susie.

Susie:
Mr. Red! Aren't you supposed to be working?!

Stone the Infected:
Oh, we took the day off. We weren't going to miss the moment you took over the shop.

James the Worker:
That's right. I've been coming here every day for the last few years now. I probably know this place better than I do my own home.

Bean the Infected:
Your wife could give you a good socking for that.

Quercus:
Alrighty, then. Miss Susie, our new owner, the shop is all yours!

Susie:
......

Susie:
*Sob*...

Quercus:
Oh, why are you tearing up? Don't cry!

James the Worker:
Yeah, no crying.

James the Worker:
Life's been hard for all of us lately. It's not often we get something to celebrate, yeah?

James the Worker:
Cheer up!

Bean the Infected:
Anyway, it doesn't matter what you turn the place into. I'll be here.

Grani:
Hahaha... What's this? Tears of joy?

Susie:
(Breaking up) Miss Quercus... I...

Quercus:
Okay, okay now. No more tears...

My dream—

To the Infected, dreams are distant and unattainable.

My dream has always been to have my own shop, my own life.

So I wouldn't have to be a burden on my family anymore.

And now, my dream is about to come true. It's an unimaginable luxury for an Infected.

Does that make me lucky?

November 24th, 1097, 6:35 A.M.

Smoke...

A thick layer of smoke spreads from a corner of the Infected community, breaking the morning tranquility.

Guards Member:
Evacuate the nearby residents first!

Guards Member:
You there, quit dawdling about! Nothing to see here!

Firefighter:
Over here! The fire's still going!

Firefighter:
Check again for casualties! This is the Infected community!

Firefighter:
Look for any traces of Originium, like damaged appliances!

Firefighter:
Don't let any activated dust spread!

Guards Member:
Bloody hell... Why's somebody setting fires around here?!

Susie:
Why...

Guards Member:
Evacuate everyone first! Hey, you, Feline over there! What are you doing?!

Smoke...

The smoke and scorched stench fill the air.

The burning leather and timber crack apart in the lingering heat.

Firefighter:
Don't run in there! Are you daft?!

Guards Member:
Hold her back!

Susie:
Why...

The girl is unwilling to believe what she sees before her. She wants to close her eyes.

This has to be a dream.

This has to be a bad dream.

Right. The moment she opens her eyes, she'll be free of this nightmare.

Yes, when she open her eyes, she'll be greeted by the same old ceiling. A new day awaits her. A new day with her own shop.

But the shop before her is nothing but a pile of rubble engulfed in flames.

Of the sign that once read 'Green Spark,' nothing remains but a few burnt fragments. It matches the walls and ceiling, long since rendered ash.

Before her eyes lies what was once her dreams, her hopes, and her future.

All of it now buried in this burning rubble.

Susie:
Why...?

The will that once helped the Feline girl through countless tribulations can support her small body no longer.

She falls to her knees.

The scorching ashes burns her hands and legs. The broken fragments cut through her skin.
