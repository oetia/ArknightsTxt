Croque Diamondface:
Without further ado, let's begin the first joint Zeruertza-Acahualla-Rhodes Island swimming competition!

Croque Diamondface:
I'm Croque Diamondface, Zeruertza's business representative. This broadcast is brought to you by Deculture Silvermint's newest high-definition camera.

Croque Diamondface:
First, let's take a look at the course.

Croque Diamondface:
The race will take place on an underground lake that stretches from here, all the way to the tunnel.

Croque Diamondface:
The winner will get an unlimited supply of my special craft ale for one month!

Croque Diamondface:
The Rhodes Island representative is—

Croque Diamondface:
The Wind of Iberia, Rhodes Island's sexiest man, Elysium!

Elysium:
What's up, Durins?

Inam:
Was that introduction why he pulled Croque to the side to talk to her?

Croque Diamondface:
The Acahualla representative is—

Croque Diamondface:
Gavial!

Tomimi:
Go for it, Gavial!

Gavial:
Hey everybody!

Croque Diamondface:
And we have a surprise for the Zeruertza representative—

Croque Diamondface:
Master Edge, our environment and climate representative!

Avdotya:
......

Avdotya:
How did a tunnel survey turn into a swimming competition?

Gavial:
It's a rare opportunity, isn't it?

Gavial:
We're still waiting on the equipment, after all.

Gavial:
Plus, it's not easy to go back and forth with the railway out of operation. If we're going over anyway, we might as well do something fun with it.

Avdotya:
Sigh... have it your way.

Gavial:
Aren't you coming?

Avdotya:
Not interested. I would rather check up on Tomimi and Deculture's progress.

Gavial:
What a boring Ursus woman.

Avdotya:
I'm not Ursus!

Avdotya:
And how did you convince Master Edge?

Edge Eartheart:
I volunteered, Avdotya.

Avdotya:
But...

Edge Eartheart:
I just wanted you to help me out while you're having fun.

Edge Eartheart:
Now that you've helped me, I certainly won't object to this little event.

Edge Eartheart:
We have plenty who like to play in the water, but not a single one who's actually a good swimmer.

Edge Eartheart:
This is about the pride of Zeruertza, after all, so I've got to put this sack of old bones on the line.

Avdotya:
......

Gavial:
Don't sweat it, Master. It's all friendly competition.

Edge Eartheart:
You say that, but I can't have people talking about how Zeruertza lost to a bunch of surface-dwellers!

Gavial:
Avdotya said she's not interested. She didn't say she wouldn't do it.

Edge Eartheart:
Durins aren't a pushy people. If she doesn't want to join, I won't force her.

Avdotya:
......

Edge Eartheart:
Plus, Avdotya isn't a native of Zeruertza. Makes sense she wouldn't want to represent us.

Edge Eartheart:
Looks like it's up to me then.

Avdotya:
...Alright, alright, I'll compete on behalf of the Durins!

Avdotya:
Happy now?

Edge Eartheart:
Really?

Avdotya:
How can I not, after what you said?

Gavial:
That's more like it!

Edge Eartheart:
Croque!

Croque Diamondface:
Are you really going to participate, Avdotya?

Avdotya:
Is there a problem?

Croque Diamondface:
(Whisper) Unlimited supply of craft ale for one month. It will be a real hit for me if she wins this.

Croque Diamondface:
Well, it's just friendly competition. No need to be too serious about it.

Avdotya:
I'll win this! For Zeruertza, and for the ale!

Croque Diamondface:
Er, alright, good luck.

Croque Diamondface:
Excuse the interruption. We have an announcement to make.

Croque Diamondface:
Avdotya will be subbing in for Master Edge as the representative of Zeruertza.

Croque Diamondface:
Let's give her a round of applause!

Gavial:
You still have to come with us across the river, though, Master Edge.

Gavial:
How about you ride on my back during the competition? I'll take you across.

Edge Eartheart:
Oh?

Avdotya:
Was that intended to be an insult, Gavial?

Gavial:
Hm? No.

Gavial:
I just don't think I'll lose.

Avdotya:
......

Gavial:
Speaking of which, you should probably get changed if you're gonna race.

Avdotya:
Since you're carrying extra weight, these clothes will do just fine.

Gavial:
Oh?

Avdotya:
Just because I don't exercise often doesn't mean I'm out of shape.

Avdotya:
I'm not so weak that I'll lose to a Sargon.

Gavial:
Ha. There it is, that's the face. Haven't seen you make a better one yet.

Avdotya:
Dúra.

Croque Diamondface:
Contestants, please take your positions.

Gavial:
They're calling us.

Avdotya:
I have ears.

Elysium:
Maybe this isn't the best time to interrupt, but did they forget that I'm competing as well?

Elysium:
Whatever. They'll find out who has the real skills when the action starts.

Croque Diamondface:
On your marks.

Croque Diamondface:
Ready.

Gavial:
Hang on tight, Master Edge. Things could get a little rough once the race starts.

Edge Eartheart:
Don't underestimate the wisdom of age.

Croque Diamondface:
Get—

Avdotya:
Damn it, I got provoked into letting my Ursine slip.

Avdotya:
I'll beat you, Gavial.

Croque Diamondface:
Set—

Elysium:
Oh, come to think of it, I should have asked Croque to add the title 'Lone Ranger' to my name.

Elysium:
I'll remember for next time.

Croque Diamondface:
It just occurred to me... don't I have to follow them if I want to get a good angle with the camera?

Croque Diamondface:
But I don't have a boat, and I can't exactly hold a camera while swimming. What do I do?

At Croque's command, the three contestants — plus one passenger — leap into the water.

The race begins.

Announcement From Afar:
Gavial has taken the lead.

Announcement From Afar:
Ever since she came to Zeruertza, Gavial has wowed us with her superb athleticism.

Announcement From Afar:
She's gotten ahead of the pack, even with Master Edge on her back!

Stitch Canvas:
They're having a little too much fun.

Deculture Silvermint:
Why don't you join them, Stitch Canvas?

Stitch Canvas:
Deculture?! Why are you here? Aren't you working on repairing the railway?

Deculture Silvermint:
No problem, I've put the bots to work there.

Stitch Canvas:
Keep your distance. I have Oripathy.

Deculture Silvermint:
Oripathy doesn't spread so easily, does it?

Deculture Silvermint:
Plus, I like the peace and quiet of your place.

Stitch Canvas:
......

Announcement From Afar:
Well, there's a surprise. Gavial is still in the lead, as expected.

Announcement From Afar:
But how many of us would have expected Avdotya to be hot on her tail?

Announcement From Afar:
Who could have guessed that the elegant lady of Zeruertza has such power within her?

Announcement From Afar:
She's keeping pace with Gavial, who hasn't been able to shake her.

Announcement From Afar:
Oops, I can't see. Can someone give me a shoulder to stand on?

Announcement From Afar:
There we go. Thanks.

Stitch Canvas:
I've read in 'Stranger Things' that the people of Ursus are a hardy folk, able to live on nothing but ice for three months. I still didn't expect Avdotya to really keep pace with Gavial...

Deculture Silvermint:
You sure are interested in what's going on there. Why don't you go over and have a look?

Stitch Canvas:
Not interested. It's a waste of time.

Deculture Silvermint:
Really? You've hardly touched your sketch since the race started.

Stitch Canvas:
......

Stitch Canvas:
What do you want, Deculture?

Deculture Silvermint:
I'm just curious, Stitch. What's troubling you?

Deculture Silvermint:
Because you felt like you deceived Gavial and her friends?

Deculture Silvermint:
Things don't have to be so complicated. Everything will fall into place if you agree to fix the dome.

Deculture Silvermint:
You don't want to fix the dome, so you're using the vote results as an excuse not to do it. Instead, you made the proposal to demolish the slide and repair the railway.

Stitch Canvas:
And I'm not wrong! Blowing up the slide and fixing the railway will allow us to detect the spread of active Originium!

Deculture Silvermint:
I didn't say you were wrong. While machine surveying of Originium has fallen out of fashion, the equipment we have is still usable.

Deculture Silvermint:
Master Edge's problems will be solved once we build a boat and set things up.

Deculture Silvermint:
He won't be pestering you about the dome anymore. You can continue your design work in this hut of yours, competing with Catch, and everybody lives happily ever after.

Deculture Silvermint:
Why are you anxious?

Deculture Silvermint:
What are you anxious about?

Stitch Canvas:
I...

Announcement From Afar:
We're at the halfway point, 300m point.

Announcement From Afar:
What's that? It's 400m already? Alright.

Announcement From Afar:
Anyway, the order hasn't changed since the start of the race, with Gavial in the lead, Avdotya in second place, and Elysium in third.

Announcement From Afar:
Al-though Elysium has not overtaken the others, his form is a thing of beauty!

Announcement From Afar:
Is he staying in third place on purpose?

Stitch Canvas:
I just feel uneasy.

Stitch Canvas:
Like I've dumped everything on them.

Stitch Canvas:
I agreed to compete with Catch on a design for a new Zeruertzan landmark... but how can I convince the people? I have no confidence there.

Deculture Silvermint:
You'll get along so much better with Catch if you're being honest about your feelings with him.

Stitch Canvas:
...It won't happen.

Stitch Canvas:
I'll never like him, and he'll never like me.

Deculture Silvermint:
Hm... well, I'm just looking for a place to take a break. It's none of my business if you want to keep staring at a blank piece of paper.

Deculture Silvermint:
But if you want to check things out—

Strange Machine #0429:
Deculture, Deculture. The first boat for the railway project is complete and ready by the lakeside.

Deculture Silvermint:
The excavation and survey equipment that Master Edge asked for. You can help me deliver it.

Stitch Canvas:
......

Stitch Canvas:
Thanks.

Strange Machine #0429:
Deculture, Deculture, taking care of Stitch.

Deculture Silvermint:
I'm not the only one taking care of him.

Deculture Silvermint:
Well, I can take a nap now that he's gone.

Deculture Silvermint:
I'll leave the rest to you and the surface-dwellers.

Strange Machine #0429:
Do not worry. Zumama, our friend, will help. Do not worry.

Deculture Silvermint:
You like her that much?

Strange Machine #0429:
Zumama cares for us. We like Zumama.

Deculture Silvermint:
What a strange surface-dweller.

Croque Diamondface Up High:
We're here by the lake to get a better view!

Croque Diamondface Up High:
Hey, is that Stitch the architect over there?

Croque Diamondface Up High:
Wait, stop fidgeting! I'll lose my footing!

Croque Diamondface Up High:
Whoa!!!

The Durins have made a Durin tower for Croque, so she can see the race better.

It is not easy to keep up a tower consisting of dozens of Durins, however, and it begins to lean at Croque's movement, eventually—

Croque Diamondface:
Ouch, my butt...

Tomimi:
The robot said the boat is parked around here.

Tomimi:
This is the equipment that Master Edge asked for?

Tomimi:
I'll load Gavial's equipment onto it as well, and ask someone to bring the boat across.

Stitch Canvas:
Hff... phew...

Stitch Canvas:
This is the boat?

Tomimi:
Stitch? I think so.

Stitch Canvas:
Off I go then.

Tomimi:
Huh?

Croque Diamondface:
Oh, he just got onto the boat that the robots brought to the lakeside, and he's sailing across the lake!

Croque Diamondface:
Did he come to join the competition?

Croque Diamondface:
Come to think of it, the rules don't say you can't use vehicles!
