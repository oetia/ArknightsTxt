Edge Eartheart:
Head for the surface?

Avdotya:
The Durins have never been to the surface before!

Gavial:
Uh, didn't Stitch? And the people who brought all those library books back from overground?

Gavial:
And look, nothing in the rulebook says you can't, right?

Gavial:
I mean, listen to you guys. The tunnel's too dangerous, a new shelter's gonna take too long.

Gavial:
So, you head up top and take refuge in Acahualla for a while. That's the best plan to me.

Avdotya:
That lift could hardly hold so many...

Avdotya:
......

Gavial:
What?

Avdotya:
I really want to refute you, but...

Avdotya:
Your group missed it during your time in Zeruertza, but trains are by far the most common means of transport in Durin society.

Avdotya:
Though lifts are convenient for vertical movement...

Avdotya:
Durin cities aren't nomadic, so they face the risk of destruction from the moment they're built. Lifts that can only move vertically have far less use to them than trains do.

Avdotya:
Moreover, Durin explorers have calculated that Durin cities often lie 1000 to 1500m below the surface. Hardly any cities exist outside of that range.

Avdotya:
Which is to say, Durins probe the underground in horizontals. It's rare for there to be one city just a hundred, maybe two hundred meters below another.

Gavial:
Uh... so what does this have to do with the lift?

Avdotya:
I know explaining this to you is a waste of time, but I have to show responsibility for others here.

Gavial:
What? All you're trying to tell me is trains are more Durin-handy, yeah?

Avdotya:
*sigh* I suppose so.

Avdotya:
And given that, what purpose would a lift then have for existing?

Elysium:
I get it. It's for resources, isn't it?

Elysium:
I don't claim to know why the Durins tend to expand their cities horizontally. Some kind of ingrained habit, I guess.

Elysium:
But forget that. It doesn't mean they scout out resources horizontally as well. Right?

Avdotya:
I thought you were playing the braggart when you claimed you'd been places. I can definitely see your prowess now.

Elysium:
Wowie.

Elysium:
Gavial, check it. Even Miss Avdotya here sees my worth better than you do.

Gavial:
Big whoop. Don't care.

Elysium:
Miss Avdotya, next time you get into an argument with Gavial, I'm on your side.

Avdotya:
I'll be fine, thank you.

Avdotya:
Anyhow, you're correct. The Durins are filled with a passion for probing underground, especially for minerals.

Avdotya:
In addition, city planning requires the joint decisions of many, while digging is something each Durin is free to commit to at their leisure.

Avdotya:
Consequently, they often end up digging several hundred meters above or below their cities out of sheer unawareness.

Avdotya:
In fact, quite a number of Durin historians believe...

Avdotya:
The first Durin lift was only designed when an industrial representative discovered a vein in the roof of their very own city, and that it would be most convenient to dig straight to it.

Avdotya:
However, following an unchecked surge of Durin interest in the surface, such lifts have often been used as shortcuts to the overground.

Gavial:
Huh... so you're saying Durins mainly use it to shift ore, and sometimes there's little scamps like Stitch hitching a ride on them to have some surface fun.

Stitch Canvas:
I've told you, I'm about the same age as you, Gavial!

Gavial:
Uh-huh, sure. So, I mean, I get all that, but I still don't understand what you're getting AT.

Avdotya:
*sigh*...

Elysium:
Miss Avdotya's trying to say that since Durin lifts are mostly designed for industry, they're real sturdy stuff.

Elysium:
Tomimi and me sure noticed that when we came down. The lift could hold a few dozen people, no sweat.

Elysium:
So, Gavial, your suggestion's pretty feasible.

Elysium:
Right, Master Edge?

Edge Eartheart:
Hear, hear.

Edge Eartheart:
I can confirm, the Super Convenient Lift-o-Matic #1 was designed after a vote, which came after some numbskull with nothing to do found a vein up above.

Edge Eartheart:
But then we found a vein even closer, so the thing went by the wayside.

Gavial:
Oh, that tracks. I heard that one cave got mined clean. You think it was you Durin guys who dug the entire cave out in the first place?

Edge Eartheart:
That, I couldn't say. It's possible.

Avdotya:
In addition, to cope with potential future situations, the Durins would have naturally dug out more space while planning the lift, for ease of future enlargement.

Elysium:
Which means, if we're going to make the most reasonable use of our remaining time, enlarging the lifts and getting the Durins to the surface is definitely the way to go.

Gavial:
Oh. You could've just said that then.

Avdotya:
If you only know what to do, and not why you're doing it, then you'll run into setbacks someday.

Gavial:
Yeah, I know that.

Gavial:
But I'm a doctor, Avdotya.

Gavial:
And look, you know it deep down, don't you?

Gavial:
How could I ever not trust you?

Avdotya:
Why didn't anyone tell me we were getting along so well?

Gavial:
In my opinion, we're already best buds.

Avdotya:
......

Edge Eartheart:
Long and short of it is, I approve of Gavial's suggestion.

Edge Eartheart:
You can hammer out the remaining details. I'll be continuing the survey.

Elysium:
I'll help you out, Master Edge. My Arts can transmit info. If you turn up any results, I can notify everyone first thing.

Edge Eartheart:
Aye.

Stitch Canvas:
......

Elysium:
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

Elysium:
Miss Avdotya, I understand. You're against returning to the surface, and your own experiences inform that.

Elysium:
But you're one of Zeruertza's driving citizens, too. Your opinion swings things.

Elysium:
And you're an honorable person, on top of that. Now's not the time for it, and you get that, don't you?

Avdotya:
...*sigh*.

Elysium:
Alright, everyone. Rustle us up a happy plan.

Stitch Canvas:
I'll help Master Edge too. No point in tossing around landmark designs now.

Gavial:
Huh? Not like there's anything you can do in there, right?

Stitch Canvas:
Can I not be concerned for my own city?

Gavial:
Oh. Sure. Knock yourself out.

Gavial:
So, Avdotya, you still against it?

Avdotya:
(Deep breath in and out)

Avdotya:
If this is the best method we have to save the people of Zeruertza, then my small contrarianism hardly amounts to anything.

Avdotya:
However. Gavial.

Avdotya:
You're very strong. Stronger, even, than most Ursus soldiers I've met.

Avdotya:
But this isn't a problem you can solve with just strength.

Avdotya:
Have you thought about how we're dealing with hundreds of thousands of Durins here?

Avdotya:
If hundreds of thousands of people showed up out of nowhere in a region of Sargon, do you know how terrifying that would be?

Avdotya:
This isn't something you can solve just by telling us your rainforest is big enough.

Avdotya:
How will the region's lord ameer react?

Avdotya:
And how will Sargon as a nation react?

Avdotya:
They're going to the surface because they believe in you, but if the reality awaiting them is crueler still...

Avdotya:
Do you still have the courage to say that no other way will work?

Gavial:
......

Inam:
Gavial, you would be the most fitting lord ameer for Acahualla. You are the only one who can rein in each and every Tiacauh.

Inam:
Everyone is awaiting your return.

Inam:
And if you simply cannot do it, then it's ultimately likely... that a lord ameer from the Court of Sargon will come to govern Acahualla instead.

Inam:
And when that happens, Acahualla will no longer be the free land you knew.

Gavial swallows a sliver of hesitation.

She realizes the choice is now facing her, waiting, and she didn't even notice that it came.

No, she's not unwilling to assume this duty. Far from it.

Not even on her vagrant trails, not even in her days on end at Rhodes Island, did she ever forget Acahualla and her people.

However—

Neither has she forgotten the decision she made, when she resolved to leave Acahualla in the first place.

She was going to study medicine. She was going to save the Oripathy sufferers.

Those two choices she made were the right ones, and they were what she wanted. That's how simple it was. That's why she's never found it this hard to choose.

Avdotya:
So it seems it's crossed your mind. You're not that much a simpleton.

Avdotya:
So, Gavial. If you truly can settle this problem, then I would be willing to even persuade the Durins for you.

Avdotya:
What is your answer?

Gavial:
......

But. Just as Avdotya says, if this is the only way to save Zeruertza...

If her becoming the lord ameer would solve this problem...

If this is the price she must pay to abide by her own ideals—

Then in that case—

Gavial:
I—

Tomimi:
I—I'll be Acahualla's lord ameer, and I'll bear the responsibility for this!

Gavial:
Tomimi?!

Stitch Canvas:
......

Stitch Canvas:
Zeruertza's... going to be destroyed?

Stitch Canvas:
Ha, haha... that's a seriously unfunny joke.

Stitch lifts his head, and lifts his gaze to the dome.

He'd been avoiding repairing it all along. Avoiding redesigning the thing, perhaps.

He'd always assumed he'd still have time.

Only now does he realize, he's out. It's gone. He has time no longer.

Stitch Canvas:
Teacher, it seems my hope of surpassing you is behind me.

Stitch jumps aboard a small boat, and sails it for the other shore.

He has to find somewhere to calm down.

Gavial:
Tomimi, what are you doing here?

Eunectes:
We were bringing Master Edge's equipment and workers over, and came to see how it was going while were here.

Inam:
Looks like we were right to do it.

Gavial:
You two as well... Hold on, so, Tomimi, have you ever actually, seriously, considered what you just said?

Tomimi:
Of course I have!

Tomimi:
Acahualla's always been without a lord ameer, Miss Avdotya.

Tomimi:
It's just like you said. If all those Durins went to the surface, they'd draw the attention of the Sargon government for sure.

Tomimi:
So before that happens, I—I'll be the Sargon lord ameer to govern the Acahualla region, and I'll make all of this smooth and simple!

Avdotya:
No lord ameer? Even then, becoming a lord ameer isn't...

Inam:
I hold the status of Sargon's government-posted Acahuallan Messenger... and scout.

Inam:
If I assist, then provided Acahualla comes to have a lord ameer before drawing government attention, this incident can be wholly suppressed.

Inam:
That should ease some of your concern, correct?

Avdotya:
......

Gavial:
But, Tomimi, you...

Tomimi:
It's alright! This way, you don't need to go to any trouble, Gavial!

Gavial:
I mean, yeah, but...

Eunectes:
No pressure, Gavial.

Eunectes:
Tomimi's volunteering to do it, and if she doesn't, then I can do it too.

Tomimi:
Mm-hm!

Gavial:
Zumama...

Eunectes:
Or are you scared? You think you made a mistake?

Gavial:
......

Gavial:
I don't, I just have this weird feeling...

Gavial:
Let me think up a way to describe it.

Gavial:
Yeah. Okay, it's like. I've got this giant boulder in front of me right now.

Gavial:
And I'm thinking, I have to use up so much of my strength just to break it.

Gavial:
But once I give it a shot, something tells me, wow, you can break this thing so easily.

Gavial:
But it's like, why? Even though it's so big.

Eunectes:
Gavial, how's the axe I made you? Handy?

Gavial:
Yeah. Honestly, even more handy than I thought. I like it a lot.

Eunectes:
I stayed for days straight making it for you, and the materials are all the best I could get too.

Gavial:
What? C'mon, you should've said so sooner. I'm embarrassing myself here.

Eunectes:
I'm telling you because I want you to understand—I don't need you to thank me for making these things for you.

Eunectes:
Because—

Tomimi:
Because Gavial's Gavial!

Gavial:
What the hell does that mean?

Eunectes:
Something very simple—

Eunectes:
Your fists are bigger than you think, Gavial.

Eunectes:
Because you have me.

Tomimi:
And me!

Eunectes:
And the Rhodes Islanders, and all the people you've saved, and everyone in Acahualla too.

Eunectes:
Because in the end, you're right, Gavial.

Eunectes:
Ultimately, all those guys you beat into submission are willing to recognize you, because they realize that in the end, you're right.

Eunectes:
Gavial, you believe in the right things. You've never gone wrong.

Tomimi:
We all believe in you, Gavial.

Eunectes:
So, our fists are your fists.

Eunectes:
And you can keep on believing in your fists.

Tomimi:
All you've gotta do is charge ahead, Gavial! We'll help you out!

Gavial:
You guys...

Tomimi:
Oh, but, but—

Tomimi:
Zumama, next time you make equipment for Gavial, I want to help too!

Eunectes:
I can do it myself.

Tomimi:
No, it's unfair only having a Zumama charm! I want to draw on my... my dreamcatcher! And the 'Gavial's Will' mark! And, and...

Gavial:
Uh, no can do, Tomimi, that's too much.

Gavial:
No putting curses on my tail!

Tomimi:
*whimper* Gavial, please don't bonk my head...

Inam:
......

Standing by Avdotya, Inam can sense that this Lupo woman to her side is having a somewhat hard time believing her eyes.

But to herself, it's a trivial, banal thing.

She lets out a small sigh.

She knows that finally, she's come to a decision too.

Inam:
And on that note, I have a better proposal.

Eunectes:
Inam?

Inam:
I'll serve as Acahualla's lord ameer.

Gavial:
Huh?

Inam:
I've hung around with you as a government Messenger for all these years. I have the right to stand for lord ameer.

Inam:
I just didn't want to before, that's all.

Inam:
Seeing as we'd have to force Tomimi back from Rhodes Island, whereas I've been in Acahualla the whole time, I'd make a tidier fit for lord ameer, wouldn't I?

Inam:
And I imagine that better assuages your concerns, Avdotya.

Avdotya:
Yes, it does, but I have to say, you people really boggle my mind...

Inam:
They're... no, we're just a couple of fools living in the rainforest.

Tomimi:
Inam, are you really sure about this?

Inam:
Well, this way, you won't need to leave Gavial, will you?

Gavial:
......

Inam:
Gavial, I have this feeling we'll be fine friends, won't we?

Gavial:
Hahaha, of course we will!

Gavial:
If you insist, then hell, go right on ahead!

Avdotya:
......

Avdotya:
Now I see. All else aside, you've definitely persuaded me. I'll make good on my commitment.

Avdotya:
However, Gavial, don't get carried away yet.

Avdotya:
An entire city's worth of people are headed for the surface. There's no precedent for something like this in all of Durin history.

Avdotya:
It's something the entire city has to decide on, and if the people ultimately dissent, then we're out of luck.

Gavial:
Which is exactly why we need you to talk 'em over.

Avdotya:
Not a worry. I made you my promise. I'll do all I can.

Gavial:
Haha. Thanks.

Avdotya:
(Under breath) Honestly, I should be thanking you on behalf of all of Zeruertza.

Gavial:
Huh? What did you say?

Avdotya:
I said, I need to return and make some preparations.

Gavial:
Alright, I'll—

Avdotya:
Are you able to draft my speech for me?

Gavial:
Yeah, no.

Avdotya:
Then I suggest you do something that plays to your strengths. If I do need your help at any point, I'll let you know.

Gavial:
Gotcha.

Gavial:
Alright, Inam, we've gotta get you and Zumama back to the surface stat. Evac the elderly and children to someplace around Acahualla.

Gavial:
Next—

Eunectes:
Taskforce with the working adults to enlarge the lifts, right?

Gavial:
You got it.

Inam:
No problem.

Tomimi:
What about me, Gavial?

Gavial:
You stay by my side, Tomimi.

Gavial:
Avdotya's good on assistance, so let's go see if we can help Master Edge out with anything.

Tomimi:
Mm-hm!

Gavial:
Alright, 'scuse us.

Inam:
Come to think of it... Zumama.

Inam:
I know this isn't too realistic, but... I'm supposing we can't return the way you and Gavial originally came?

Eunectes:
Yep, that's not quite happening.

Inam:
Then we'll need someone to show the way. The cave network's considerably complex above the network. I haven't forgotten as much for a single second.

Inam:
Stitch could work, since he brought us down. Elysium too; he might even find the way better than Stitch did.

Avdotya:
No need. Seeing as we still have time, you come with me.

Eunectes:
Huh?

Avdotya:
I'll be honest; luck played an enormous part in Stitch emerging from such a complex network alive.

Avdotya:
And Elysium's helping Master Edge out, so let's let him be here.

Inam:
You mean to say you know the way?

Avdotya:
The likelihood is, nobody in modern-day Zeruertza does.

Avdotya:
But you know the Durin adventurers, filled with the spirit of exploration? Each time they finish a foray, they're always happy to record everything they've seen and heard in books, so they can share with their companions.

Avdotya:
And in the library, I once read such an adventurer's log, which finely detailed how he went through the cave network above the lift, and made it to the surface.

Avdotya:
And while I don't know where said adventurer is now, he was considerate enough to leave behind a map.
