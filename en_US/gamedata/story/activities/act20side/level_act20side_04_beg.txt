Excited Durin:
Hey, have you heard the bombastic news?

Eager Durin:
Which?

Excited Durin:
Croque said the leaders are talking about putting together something new!

Eager Durin:
Ugh, that plan to turn all the lights in the city green? Can't say I'm a fan.

Excited Durin:
Not that one! The one about the slide!

Excited Durin:
I heard Stitch and Catch are having a huge row over the Great Aquapit's refurbishment plans!

Eager Durin:
The two of them?! How far are they into their debate?

Excited Durin:
Uhh, I think now they'll use water cannons to blast people into another cannon, and then into another one... something like that?

Stitch Canvas:
Absolutely not!

Catch Lightrace:
Let's try a different idea, then. We'll use the water cannons to hurl people up to the springboards high above...

Stitch Canvas:
Don't you have any ideas that don't involve water cannons?

Catch Lightrace:
But it's a brilliant epiphany, and you were the one who inspired me! Well, in that case, do you have any bright ideas, Stitch the amazing architectural designer?

Stitch Canvas:
Ugh... I was just going to be the lead architectural designer and dial down Acahuallans' plans a little.

Catch Lightrace:
You had the surface-dwellers come to help with the bridge. I have no problem with that. But now we're discussing the thing that will go on top of the bridge and live alongside it, the landmark of Zeruertza!

Catch Lightrace:
You don't want to work on the dome with me. Fine, I get how you feel about the dome. Then let's talk about what will be our next landmark after the big water slide.

Stitch Canvas:
There's a much simpler and more graceful way to solve this. It could be brimming with symbolism!

Catch Lightrace:
It could be more exciting!

Stitch Canvas:
It could be more exciting and brimming with symbolism!

Stitch Canvas:
Phew, Catch, arguing about this here isn't going to get us anywhere. How about we have a design competition? We'll give each other some time to work on a design and let the citizens of Zeruertza decide.

Catch Lightrace:
Of course. Just like all those years ago.

Croque Diamondface:
I'm on board too—

Catch Lightrace:
Croque? Are you drinking?

Croque Diamondface:
I'm fine. I only had a tiny little bit.

Inam:
You emptied three whole barrels by yourself.

Croque Diamondface:
Stitch, I heard your proposal. I'm interested.

Croque Diamondface:
And if Catch is up for it, then that's all the better!

Croque Diamondface:
Now we just need to find Deculture, and we'll build something new for Zeruertza!

Deculture Silvermint:
You mean... I should change how I treat them...

Eunectes:
Don't you think they're cute?

Eunectes:
It's true that they are nowhere close to what you'd call 'human.' I'm no doctor, but even so, I know that humans are way more complex than the machines we have these days.

Eunectes:
But that doesn't mean we can't get along with them like friends and family.

Eunectes:
Deculture, you're these a 'parent' to these little guys.

Deculture Silvermint:
Parent, huh...?

Eunectes:
They count on you and trust you, just like newly hatched fowlbeasts growing under their mothers' wings.

Deculture Silvermint:
For the longest time, I've really only seen them in... an indifferent light. All I ever do is what an industrial representative should, the same thing that all the industrial representatives before me did.

Deculture Silvermint:
We pick our robot managers from the Durins who hang out in the robotics section of the library. We have to master how to create these little things.

Deculture Silvermint:
It's not actually that complicated. All we have to do is follow the books' instructions and put together the parts that we like... use our imaginations, and they always work without fail.

Deculture Silvermint:
My teacher spent years trying to figure out the logic behind them, but he came up empty-handed.

Deculture Silvermint:
From what I heard, my teacher's teacher also researched it, and it's thanks to her that the assistant robots can tell jokes.

Strange Machine #0429:
Do you know how to make a Durin angry? Nobody knows! Hahaha.

Eunectes:
Oh, that's amazing.

Deculture Silvermint:
As for me, all I'm doing is taking their abilities for granted. You're right. I should try to actually get along with them.

Deculture Silvermint:
0429, your fellow robot 0428 has been retired. Inspection will not reawaken it.

Deculture Silvermint:
But that doesn't change that it was one of us. The things that it built will last.

Deculture Silvermint:
Retirement isn't the end.

Strange Machine #0429:
Instruction acknowledged. Retirement is not the end. Understood.

Strange Machine #0429:
Relationship defined with Zumama: friend. Deculture, I would like us to be defined as friends.

Deculture Silvermint:
Friends. Right, friends. We can get along like that.

Deculture Silvermint:
0429, did you know? Friends are supposed to help each other.

Deculture Silvermint:
Before, I used to order you to do everything that I couldn't be bothered to handle myself...

Deculture Silvermint:
But now I'm thinking that's not how this should be. We should be on equal footing with one another.

Deculture Silvermint:
From here on out, I will ask you to help me with my tasks, as a friend.

Strange Machine #0429:
Acknowledged. Help friend.

Deculture Silvermint:
0429, please—

Deculture Silvermint:
Send three cases of ale to my place, and bring some snacks while you are at it. After that, please let Master Edge know that I won't be attending today's representative meeting because I'll be sleeping.

Eunectes:
That doesn't seem quite right...

???:
Zumama!

Eunectes:
Hey, Gavial, you're here!

Eunectes:
This is my new friend, Assistant Robot #0429, and its terrible boss, Deculture.

Strange Machine #0429:
Deculture, meeting invitation, all representatives—

Deculture Silvermint:
0429, change of plans. As your friend, I'm asking you to do me this favor. Go to that meeting for me.

Strange Machine #0429:
Help friend. Help friend!

Gavial:
Do it yourself!

Catch Lightrace:
Speaking of which, what was our last meeting with everyone in attendance for?

Croque Diamondface:
Alcohol was in short supply, so we had a meeting to figure out how to solve the supply chain issues.

Deculture Silvermint:
Have we ever run low on alcohol?

Croque Diamondface:
You skipped that meeting.

Edge Eartheart:
Hahaha, this brings me back. The mead fans wanted to make sure the whiskey lovers had nothing to drink, so they bought out all the whiskey in town.

Edge Eartheart:
And to get back at the mead fans, the Whiskey Enthusiasts' Association started buying up mead by the lot too.

Gavial:
These drunkards can survive without booze?

Croque Diamondface:
Of course not. That's why they started drinking the booze they bought to get at the other side.

Catch Lightrace:
I understand both clubs lost some members to the other side around that time, haha!

Catch Lightrace:
It's a shame, though. If only they had an appreciation for berry tomato wine.

Croque Diamondface:
......

Deculture Silvermint:
......

Edge Eartheart:
Catch, you... so that's your poison?

Catch Lightrace:
Yeah, what's the matter?

Croque Diamondface:
No wonder none of the alcohol fan clubs accepted you...

Edge Eartheart:
Well... Never mind, so we're all gathered today to discuss the 'Great Aquapit...'

Deculture Silvermint:
Tear it down? Yeah, I agree, and the sooner the better.

Croque Diamondface:
I'm a yea, too.

Catch Lightrace:
I thought you two loved that place! Hell, you go multiple times a week, Croque!

Croque Diamondface:
Right, and I'm regretting my patronage. I can't believe I spent so much time in a facility built by a guy who likes berry tomato wine... It's a disgrace.

Deculture Silvermint:
How negligent I must have been as the industrial representative to participate in a project led by a man like that.

Catch Lightrace:
What is that supposed to mean?! Hey, Master Edge, what's with that look?

Edge Eartheart:
Haha, berry tomato wine... That's a little...

Gavial:
If you've reached an understanding, then we'll call everyone out to blow up that showy water slide, fix the railroads, and solve all of Master Edge's problems. That's the plan. Any objections?

Catch Lightrace:
It's a shame, but an architect can't let his past work tie him down. This is a chance to once again put my talents to good use.

Croque Diamondface:
Stitch, you said you'd have a design contest with Catch over Zeruertza's new landmark. You are serious about that, aren't you?

Stitch Canvas:
Of course.

Edge Eartheart:
Oh? Finally going to amaze us with your designs again?

Stitch Canvas:
Well, with all of you here singing my praises, what choice do I have?

Edge Eartheart:
Looks like we're in for a fun couple of months. I should stock up on booze.

Catch Lightrace:
Seriously, Master Edge, why don't you try some berry tomato wine? It really isn't as bad as it sounds.

Edge Eartheart:
Not in a million years.

Catch Lightrace:
And that's the end of the voting!

Catch Lightrace:
Well, then. Per consensus, this is it for the Great Aquapit, and we will repair the railroad bridge and build a new landmark for Zeruertza at the same time!

Cheering Durin:
Hell yeah! I've been getting tired of the slide anyway!

Imaginative Durin:
The new plan better be something totally different! I heard we're getting a roller coaster?

Cheering Durin:
Water coaster!

Imaginative Durin:
Looping water coaster!

Cheering Durin:
A catapult looping water coaster! With a super water cannon! And a racetrack for self-driving carts!

Catch Lightrace:
Stitch and I will each submit an independent design proposal, and we'll call another meeting to decide which proposal to move forward with.

Cheering Durin:
Stitch? Stitch who lives in the cube?

Imaginative Durin:
Hm, I saw a design of his a few years ago... It wasn't much fun, but it had a unique sense of beauty...

Cheering Durin:
Maybe we can come up with some new way to have fun there. I mean, that place is pretty much an open space, and the important thing is what we can do with it!

Imaginative Durin:
It kind of feels like Stitch's building would be a good place to lie down and relax—

Cheering Durin:
Just like that super relaxing Gaulish meditation I saw in 'Stranger Things!'

Imaginative Durin:
Hm, I think I can work with that.

Gavial:
Phew, looks like everything went off without a hitch? Not that we actually did anything.

Inam:
But we did see a hard, bitter negotiation play out. Isn't that right, Croque?

Croque Diamondface:
Edge! Drink up, old man! What, are you keeping fins in your cup?!

Edge Eartheart:
*cough*! I'm trying to take a short break!

Tomimi:
We've done a lot, Gavial! We went shopping and bought a lot of stuff and had a decent vacation. Plus, we even helped score a huge project for Acahualla!

Avdotya:
And you also made a mess of my feelings.

Gavial:
Oh, don't say that. I thought we made friends.

Stitch Canvas:
Yes, it went much more smoothly than I expected.

Gavial:
That just goes to show that you could've done it yourself, you punk.

Stitch Canvas:
But, what's next...?

Gavial:
That's a funny look on your face.

Stitch Canvas:
It's been a while since I've worked on anything, so I'm feeling a little...

Stitch Canvas:
Phew... It's okay. I just have to warm up.

Stitch Canvas:
Once I get myself back into the game, surely—
