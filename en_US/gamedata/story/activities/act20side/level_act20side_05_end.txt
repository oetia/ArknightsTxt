Strange Machine:
Zumama, boat assembly: correct?

Eunectes:
It looks structurally sound, but there are a few things we can tweak. For example—

Eunectes:
There, that should make it more solid.

Strange Machine:
Zumama, Zumama: amazing.

Eunectes:
Just the product of experience.

Inam:
There you are, Zumama.

Eunectes:
Inam? What are you doing here?

Inam:
This survey equipment has to get across, right? I came to help since I didn't have anything else to do.

Eunectes:
Thanks.

Inam:
Why are you thanking me? Looks like you're actually becoming one of these robots.

Eunectes:
Yes, I'm glad to make so many new friends.

Strange Machine:
Zumama, Zumama: friend!

Eunectes:
And I've been trying to find a date for Lancet-2.

Inam:
Lancet-2 is the robot that came with Rhodes Island, right?

Eunectes:
Yes, she's my big sister now.

Eunectes:
I'm not skilled enough to make a robot as smart as Lancet-2, so I'm trying to find one in this group.

Inam:
And...?

Eunectes:
They're very nice, but not really her type.

Eunectes:
She likes intellectuals, like the Doctor. It's a bit of a headache.

Inam:
......

Inam:
Never mind, you're not the only weirdo in Tiacauh.

Announcement From Afar:
Hey everybody, this is Croque, and I've found a safer vantage point to continue the broadcast from.

Announcement From Afar:
How far until goal? 300m? Ah, forget it.

Announcement From Afar:
What's really important is that the architect Stitch Canvas, the only student of Master Finch, has found a boat and jumped into the race!

Announcement From Afar:
Oh? Looks like he's talking to us. Let's zoom in and see what he's saying...

Announcement From Afar:
'I'm gonna win,' I think. Yup, I'm sure that's it.

Announcement From Afar:
And he just raised his middle finger to show his motivation. Looks like there's a fiery heart beneath this architect's cold surface!

Announcement From Afar:
He may have gotten a late start, but that vehicle is definitely a huge advantage.

Announcement From Afar:
He's closing the distance as we speak!

Inam:
Things are pretty lively over there.

Inam:
I wanted to say that this is what happens with Gavial around, but she's not the only one who's let her hair down.

Eunectes:
You're not used to it?

Inam:
You have to get used to it, living in Acahualla.

Inam:
You get so used to it I feel weird if there's no one arguing and making noise around me.

Eunectes:
You're a proper Tiacauh now.

Inam:
Of course I am.

Inam:
Speaking of which, Zumama, if Gavial didn't come back last year, you were planning to become the Great Chief of Acahualla, weren't you?

Eunectes:
Becoming Great Chief wasn't the real goal; it was a way for me to prove myself.

Eunectes:
I wanted to build the most powerful machine ever.

Inam:
I knew I shouldn't have placed any expectations on you.

Eunectes:
Are you thinking about being lord ameer?

Inam:
Good to see that you and Tomimi have learned something about politics, unlike Gavial.

Inam:
I don't know how she's survived on the outside all these years.

Eunectes:
Some things we deal with as a matter of course just don't factor in for Gavial. Like adapting to your environment.

Inam:
Haha, that's true.

Eunectes:
So you want her to become lord ameer? Are you sure she's suitable?

Inam:
Pretty sure you could pick somebody off any street in Sargon and get a better lord ameer than her.

Eunectes:
Agreed.

Inam:
But if we're choosing a Tiacauh to lead Acahualla, there's no one more suitable than her.

Eunectes:
Are you speaking as a Tiacauh, or as a Sargon Messenger?

Inam:
......

Announcement From Afar:
We're entering the final stretch of the race!

Announcement From Afar:
Gavial remains in first place, but her lead continues to shrink.

Announcement From Afar:
It's not Avdotya who's closing the distance, though!

Announcement From Afar:
Despite her valiant effort, her choice of clothing has become dead weight.

Announcement From Afar:
Literally, as the weight of her clothes is slowing her down!

Announcement From Afar:
Meanwhile, Elysium is rapidly closing in!

Announcement From Afar:
Conserving his strength in the first half, Elysium now shows off his true ability.

Announcement From Afar:
He has passed Avdotya and is almost neck-and-neck with Gavial!

Announcement From Afar:
However—

Announcement From Afar:
Neither of them are aware of the true threat approaching!

Inam:
I'm impressed with Elysium. I never thought he could catch up to Gavial.

Eunectes:
His attitude is a mask. You can't get complacent.

Inam:
Yes, I noticed. He doesn't want people to know how good he is.

Eunectes:
Don't change the subject.

Inam:
Alright, looks like you've learned a thing or two at Rhodes Island.

Eunectes:
Not on purpose, but Master Closure makes me go to meetings about stuff besides technology, so I've heard a bunch of things.

Inam:
Looks like she has high hopes for you.

Inam:
As for your question...

Inam:
I've lived in Acahualla for a long time.

Inam:
Compared to city life, I prefer to stay in the jungles, watching you people fight over stupid things.

Inam:
Maybe it's hard to believe, but for me, I'm a Tiacauh a Sargon Messenger at the same time. I don't have to pick.

Inam:
Or I guess I could say, my Sargon perspective tells me that Acahualla won't stay unexplored forever. That's why I hope you'll seize the opportunity.

Eunectes:
I believe you.

Announcement From Afar:
We're headed towards a climax.

Announcement From Afar:
Exercising his explosive potential, Elysium has almost caught up to Gavial.

Announcement From Afar:
Avdotya's not out of this race yet, though, and she's still keeping pace with the two in front of her.

Announcement From Afar:
No need to push it, Avdotya!

Announcement From Afar:
But now all three of them have noticed the threat approaching from behind—Stitch, riding in his boat!

Announcement From Afar:
The wonders of machinery! He has caught up to the three in front of him in a very short period of time!

Announcement From Afar:
Only a hundred meters to the goal!

Announcement From Afar:
It's like we're at the starting line again. Three swimmers and a boat, racing their way into the final stretch!

Eunectes:
But, Inam.

Eunectes:
I won't help you convince her.

Eunectes:
Gavial should not sit in that chair.

Eunectes:
You'll get the same answer if you ask Tomimi.

Inam:
Why?

Eunectes:
Figure it out for yourself. I'm busy.

Inam:
...Fine.

Eunectes:
If you have too much free time, you can help me build this boat while you think about it.

Inam:
You really count every last coin, don't you?

Announcement From Afar:
Eighty meters!

Announcement From Afar:
Avdotya got caught in the boat's wake. She's coughing and she has to stop! Yes!

Announcement From Afar:
Er, I mean, what a shame.

Announcement From Afar:
Fifty meters!

Announcement From Afar:
Elysium tries to board the boat, but took an accidental hit from Master Edge, who is angry at Stitch, and falls back into the water!

Announcement From Afar:
There are bubbles coming to the surface. Is he okay?

Announcement From Afar:
Thirty meters!

Announcement From Afar:
By the way, Ale Keg is the name that I just gave to this boat, following in the footsteps of my other masterpiece, 'The Great Aquapit'!

Announcement From Afar:
Looks like the winner will be Ga—

Announcement From Afar:
Wait, not quite!

Announcement From Afar:
The fight between Master Edge and Stitch has destroyed the boat's instruments!

Announcement From Afar:
There's an ominous rumble coming from the Ale Keg!

Announcement From Afar:
She dashes ahead like an arrow!

Announcement From Afar:
Not even Gavial can catch the out-of-control boat!

Announcement From Afar:
The boat is the first to arrive at the goal!

Announcement From Afar:
The winner of this swimming contest is—

Announcement From Afar:
The Ale Keg!

Inam:
...What?

Announcement From Afar:
Wait, it's not over yet!

Announcement From Afar:
The Ale Keg isn't satisfied with simply crossing the finish line!

Announcement From Afar:
She rushes ashore and charges toward the cave-in!

Boom!!!

Announcement From Afar:
Master Edge and Stitch are thrown from the boat!

Announcement From Afar:
The Ale Keg has put a huge hole in the rock blocking the tunnel exit!

Announcement From Afar:
Poor Ale Keg, never to taste the breakfast of champions!

Announcement From Afar:
A moment of silence for her!

Inam:
What on earth are these people doing?
