Gavial:
There's this one proverb Blaze always pulls out. How did it go again––?

Eunectes:
The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

Gavial:
That's the one.

High Priest:
I have a conjecture. You rainforest folk have the terrible misfortune of living in that dump, so you've been compensated with extremely good luck in other areas.

High Priest:
What other explanation is there for why the lot of you haven't gone extinct yet? It doesn't make any sense.

Gavial:
It proves our way of life is good for keeping us alive.

Eunectes:
High Priest, what are Durin cities like?

High Priest:
Uhh, I don't remember. A little too boring to talk about.

High Priest:
I spent some time in the underground world a century or so ago and the only thing I can remember is that it was a nasty place chock-full of imbeciles.

High Priest:
Less interesting than watching Originium slugs sleep by the river.

High Priest:
Though, heh, you young kids ought to experience things on your own. You need to have the kind of drive and ambition that I did!

High Priest:
By the way, turn left at the next junction, and DON'T jump down!

Eunectes:
How much longer now, High Priest?

High Priest:
Good question. There's no end to the road called life. No matter how far you've come, you can only keep moving forward— plus, there's a geezer like me watching over you.

High Priest:
Oh, if you meant how far we are from the city, if you could drop right through the rocks like I can, you need to go down another five or six hundred meters.

Gavial:
Zumama, how the hell did you put up with this guy up so long? He won't shut up.

Eunectes:
He's usually not as noisy around the machines.

Gavial:
Does this chainsaw blade count as a machine?

High Priest:
Harrumph! No manners!

Eunectes:
Would you look at that. Worked like a charm.

Tomimi:
This is it... We're here!

Tomimi:
Uhh, the 'Great Aquapit?'

Inam:
Let's set aside the Durins' naming sense for now.

Inam:
This waterpark already looked pretty insane from the distance, but it's even more incredible up-close!

Inam:
Is this how Durins live all the time?!

Elysium:
Cowabunga!!

Inam:
When did he change into a swimsuit?

Tomimi:
E-Elysium, please be careful!

Elysium:
Woah, that was a close one! Are you alright? Didn't spill your drink, did you?

Durin Youth:
Well... that's weird. How'd you surface-dwellers end up down here? Never seen you people around before.

Durin Youth:
And this guy looks about as stupid as a Durin.

Inam:
Hello, sir. We were invited here by Stitch Canvas.

Tomimi:
He said, uh, he wanted us to help him with a little favor!

Durin Youth:
Stitch Canvas, huh... Would you look at that, he actually came back.

Durin Youth:
I thought he was going to say goodbye to this city for good, just like that respectable teacher of his.

Durin Youth:
As much as I'd like to offer you our famous Durin hospitality, welcoming folk that we are, I sadly can't while Stitch is running around causing havoc and ignoring all our ways.

Durin Youth:
Let me introduce myself first. I am Catch Lightrace, this city's design representative.

Catch Lightrace:
No need to be nervous. It'll be over in no time.

Inam:
What... is the meaning of this?

Elysium:
Hmm? Did the atmosphere just get a little weird all of a sudden? I can't handle all these people trying to toast me at the same time.

Tomimi:
Are you guys...?

Tomimi:
Trying to pick a fight?! I'm not afraid of you shorties!

Tomimi:
You're gonna get a taste of the combat skills Gavial taught me! Phew... Take a sturdy stance, and put your hips into it!

Tomimi:
Come at me!

Flustered Durin:
Wh-What is she doing?! Is she gonna clobber us with her stick?

Nervous Durin:
Gyaaaah! Stay away from me!

Catch Lightrace:
Hey, hey! What are you people doing?! Stop! Stop, I tell you!!

Tomimi:
Huh? I thought we were going to fight?

Catch Lightrace:
Why would Durins do such a pointless thing?!

Catch Lightrace:
Put your weapons away and come with me!

Catch Lightrace:
Ahem! Citizens of Zeruertza, this is this quarter's four hundred and seventeenth referendum.

Catch Lightrace:
Following our previous vote on this month's general background music, we decided on the color of our street lights for the week during the last referendum. Now, we must answer a new question.

Catch Lightrace:
Since this question isn't particularly important, the individuals here today are enough of a quorum to represent Zeruertza.

Catch Lightrace:
Today's question is: Zeruertza has just welcomed new guests. Should we accept them or not?

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
......

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
What guests?

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
I heard something about a guy who doesn't drink?

Catch Lightrace:
Ah, no, it's these ones standing right in front of us.

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
Cheers, brother! Isn't it crazy that there's a Durin out there who doesn't drink?

Elysium:
Yeah, that's totally crazy. Cheers!

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
Let's finish chugging this barrel, then we can go play in the water.

Elysium:
Hah, make sure to keep those eyelids peeled! You have to see what us surface-dwellers can do!

Inam:
Tomimi, sorry if I sound like a broken record, but are you sure everything's alright at Rhodes Island?

Tomimi:
Uh, p-probably?

Inam:
You're always welcome to come back if things aren't working out. Be careful— don't underestimate the amount of damage a bad environment can do to you!

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
Hurry it up, Catch! We've got a lot of stuff to take care of!

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
Brother, have you ever heard of a sport called surfing?

Elysium:
Surfing, you say? That might as well be my middle name!

???:
Objection!

???:
This guy can't be trusted!

Inam:
Ah, yeah. I knew things weren't going to be that simple...

Absent-Minded Durin:
Hey you, drunk Liberi over there!

Elysium:
Inam, they must be talking to you, because I certainly amn't drunk. Not a bit.

Absent-Minded Durin:
I AM talking to you, guy with the stein!

Elysium:
Alright. Whaddya want?

Wobbly Durin:
You'd better come out and pick a side: noble mead, or lame-ass whiskey!

Absent-Minded Durin:
We of the Old Karl Mead fan club graciously welcomed you into our fold, and now you're hanging out with those hoity-toity whiskey-sippers? My disappointment is immeasurable!

Wobbly Durin:
Not too long ago, we had our arms over each other's shoulders, shouting 'Long Live Mead' together. But I turn around for a second and you go off to play with those uppity kids?

Elysium:
Err, um, I think they're both great...

Absent-Minded Durin:
Oh no you don't! We don't take kindly to fence-sitters around here!

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
Haha, you're a joke. You can't know what's good and what's bad without a point of reference. Isn't that right, brother?

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
There's nothing to be afraid of. Speak your mind, and let the words of praise flow for our great whiskey. That is, if you want to stay in Zeruertza––

Wobbly Durin:
Hey, stop threatening him, you despicable whiskey-sipper!

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
Gah. Your mead's baby stuff! Might as well drink it out of a bottle!

Absent-Minded Durin:
Let's throw down in front of the Big Cask tonight then! Walk the walk if you talk the talk!

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
Hah, you wanna see who can chug more of your baby brew? You have my attention!

Catch Lightrace:
Wait, stop right there! The referenda we hold here in the forum are sacred! Talk about drinking somewhere else––

Catch Lightrace:
Raise your hand, and let your vote be known. The minority obeys the will of the majority— that is the eternal lodestar of Zeruertza.

Catch Lightrace:
Begin the counting of the votes!

Wobbly Durin:
If you're raising your hand, then I'm not!

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
I'm raising my hand whether you like it or not! Piss off!

Wobbly Durin:
Just wait 'til we get to the water slide. I'm gonna splash your brains out!

Topsy-Turvy Durin:
With what, that ridiculous 'technique' of yours?

Catch Lightrace:
Alright, not bad. A solemnly conducted vote.

Inam:
In what world does this count as solemn?

Catch Lightrace:
The votes have been counted, and the results are clear.

Catch Lightrace:
The people of Zeruertza have made their decision: play to your hearts' content, surface-dwellers.

Durin Attendees:
Cheers!!

Catch Lightrace:
By the way, I welcome you as an architect. That gorgeous edifice sitting atop the lake is my pride and joy. You are welcome to play your hearts out beneath it.

Inam:
You're talking about that 'Great Aquapit' over there?

Catch Lightrace:
I didn't come up with the name. It was something we all voted on!

Stitch Canvas:
Did they tack more stuff onto the 'Great Aquapit?' It looks even more hideous than the last time I saw it.

Edge Eartheart:
That's Catch's masterpiece, you know? You really shouldn't badmouth it in front of him.

Stitch Canvas:
He's not worthy of my constructive criticism anyway. Or rather, there's no way to fix it in the first place!

Stitch Canvas:
That malformed, twisted structure... Just looking at it makes me want to pass out! How can the people of Zeruertza continue to suffer him as the design representative?

Edge Eartheart:
Probably because folks really love playing on the big slide.

Stitch Canvas:
If I were calling the shots...

Edge Eartheart:
You'd use béton brute to construct... uh, an array of squares.

Stitch Canvas:
You still don't know me well enough, Edge. I'd just put a long, narrow strip of concrete there. Minimalism is beauty.

Edge Eartheart:
Huh? What about the slide then?

Stitch Canvas:
I suppose there wouldn't be any harm in slanting it a little...

Edge Eartheart:
Ahem, back to the issue at hand.

Edge Eartheart:
There don't seem to be any major issues with the dome right now, but I'm still worried.

Stitch Canvas:
Since the earthquake over six months ago, the leak that sprung in the dome has been getting worse and worse. Is that your idea of no major issues?

Edge Eartheart:
I'm just telling you what the people of Zeruertza think. The water flow increased? Makes for a more stimulating experience. The temperature control stopped working? Even better, that just means the summer's not over yet!

Edge Eartheart:
As for the Originium detection system... Well, no active Originium layers have been detected near Zeruertza for over two decades!

Stitch Canvas:
Hmph. A short-sighted bunch.

Edge Eartheart:
So, you...

Stitch Canvas:
I'm not fixing it. What's worth saving about this cheap, rickety dome? I've said it a million times.

Edge Eartheart:
Were you not looking for a solution when you first went up to the surface? Were you not thinking about ways to restore the dome?

Stitch Canvas:
Absolutely not. I was just trying to hide from you because you won't shut up.

Edge Eartheart:
Now that's a little harsh, isn't it? Just a few months ago, I was voted into the Top 100 List of Zeruertza's Nicest Elders.

Stitch Canvas:
Alright, enough of that. I know you're concerned about the state of the dome.

Stitch Canvas:
But if Catch can't even solve the issue with the dome's integrity, then forget occupying the design representative's seat, he should get the hell out of Zeruertza.

Stitch Canvas:
If we're just talking outcomes, there shouldn't be any safety concerns regarding the dome at this point.

Stitch Canvas:
We can leave the temperature control system alone, since our beloved citizens are having a good time anyway. After they get tired of it, maybe they'll raise their hands and decide to turn Zeruertza into a walk-in freezer.

Stitch Canvas:
As for that Originium detection system, if you ask me, it was never that reliable to begin with. But since you've been chasing me around everywhere, I assume that's what you're most worried about? I do have a plan for that actually.

Stitch Canvas:
It'd be better for us to rebuild the railway bridge that was damaged by the earthquake, re-excavate the collapsed tunnels, and directly install the Originium detection instruments there for more accurate readings.

Stitch Canvas:
From the very beginning, the dome was over-engineered to try to do too many things at once.

Edge Eartheart:
You'd rather take a massive detour like that than directly work on the dome? Look, even if Finch up and left without saying anything, that's still your work together, master and pupil...

Stitch Canvas:
We're done here, okay?

Stitch Canvas:
Stop before I actually get mad, Edge.

Edge Eartheart:
...Fine.

Edge Eartheart:
Right now, the problem of Originium detection takes top priority.

Stitch Canvas:
I picked up a few people up on the surface who will probably come in handy. Their hodgepodge of skills is likely enough to repair Zeruertza's railway.

Stitch Canvas:
Now, we only need to...

Edge Eartheart:
Pardon the interruption, but are those handy people from the surface you're talking about...

Edge Eartheart:
Is that one flying through the sky right now?

Stitch Canvas:
Huh?

Elysium:
Waheyyyyy!

Inam:
When you, Zumama, and Kemar first joined Rhodes Island, I didn't think much of it. But now that I've seen this guy...

Inam:
Be honest with me, Tomimi. Is it really that easy to swindle a paycheck out of your company?

Tomimi:
Elysium is actually a skilled guide and a communications specialist...

Tomimi:
Well, anyway! Maybe this is who he really is!

Durin Hawker:
Here's the sweet fruit wine you wanted~

Tomimi:
Thank you!

Inam:
Uhh, how should I pay? Or rather, how'd you buy all that other stuff before?

Tomimi:
I told the nice tailor granny a few stories about Gavial, and she was so happy she gave me these clothes for free!

Elysium:
As for me... The drinks were covered by my good friends from the fan club, and I put the food on Stitch's tab.

Inam:
I guess you'll probably survive, no matter where you get tossed.

Elysium:
That's one of the qualities of a professional guide!

Inam:
Ma'am, go ahead and put our drinks on Mr. Stitch's tab as well. He won't mind.

Durin Hawker:
You got it!

Catch Lightrace:
Haha, that guy's stingier than you'd think. Here, let me pay for those drinks.

Catch Lightrace:
I am quite proud of this amusement park after all. Naturally, I hope you'll have a great time.

Tomimi:
Mr. Lightrace, do you and Mr. Canvas know each other well?

Catch Lightrace:
Depends what you mean by 'well.'

Catch Lightrace:
When we were young, we ran into each other a lot, since we were competing. We've gone head-to-head over several projects, some of which I won, some of which he won.

Catch Lightrace:
The only project neither one of us could secure was this dome above our heads.

Catch Lightrace:
We both have ideas for how we'd like to improve Zeruertza's iconic dome, and for a few years, we practically met every day––

Catch Lightrace:
During the referendum meetings, we both worked hard to prove that our respective ideas for the dome renovation were better.

Catch Lightrace:
But in the end, neither of us managed to win over a majority of Zeruertza's population.

Catch Lightrace:
After all, the dome is the legacy of Master Finch, the design representative who came before me.

Catch Lightrace:
And Stitch, as his student, is also...

Catch Lightrace:
Forget it. There are some things I'm not meant to say. You'd be better off asking him yourself.

Elysium:
Catch, my dear bro, why is someone as young as you talking like a withered old man? 'When we were young?' Come on.

Elysium:
Just follow Elysium's lead. Keep your heart pure, and face life with a smile! Instead of lamenting days bygone, come enjoy a drink with us––

Durin Hawker:
Liberi man, your extra-large barrel of ice-cold beat-the-heat ale is here!

Elysium:
Help yourselves, everyone! Our good friend Catch wants us to have a good time, so how could we possibly disappoint his expectations?

Elysium:
So, my good brother, mind if I order some more? The folks from the fan club aren't paying for other drinks, and there's still so much I want to try.

Catch Lightrace:
......

Catch Lightrace:
Are you sure you're not a Durin on stilts?

Contemplative Lupo:
'How should I describe the feeling of this long-leaf dew rolling down my throat? How ought I praise it without using words so pedestrian?'

Contemplative Lupo:
'Tis as if I could swallow a cloud, or pluck a string of spring rain's pearls.'

Contemplative Lupo:
'Tis as if I could feel the falling of winter's last two snowflakes...'

Contemplative Lupo:
Uhh, they probably have no idea what falling snowflakes are, so maybe I'll go with a more Durin metaphor.

Contemplative Lupo:
'Two super-frosty fruit-flavored ice cubes fall into a marvelous explosion of flavor––'

Gavial:
Ugh, that hurts––

Gavial:
The High Priest was right, we really shouldn't have jumped down.

Eunectes:
It's been a real long time since I've felt like my bones were gonna fall apart. Probably the last time we fought.

Gavial:
Yeah. Now I think I'm starting to hallucinate. About fruit-flavored ice cubes and rum. Think it might be an aftereffect of our fall?

Gavial:
Huh? Why's there a Lupo sleeping here?

Eunectes:
Do you think... this might be our fault?

Gavial:
Probably not... right? Uhh, think I should treat her?

Eunectes:
Did you bring your medical kit?

Gavial:
Dr. Kal'tsit once said that a true master of medicine can resolve most problems with her bare hands.

Eunectes:
Did she now?

Gavial:
Well, I don't remember her exact words, but that's the gist I took from it. Alright, where to start...?

Lupo:
*gasp*!

Gavial:
Oh, she's awake. I haven't even gotten started yet.

Eunectes:
Um... Are you alright?

Lupo:
Ugh, my head's still spinning...

Gavial:
Sorry, I think the two of us might've bumped into you earlier. Need me to inspect you?

Lupo:
What are you doing here?

Gavial:
Come again...?

Lupo:
How did you two find this place?

Gavial:
Mind if we ask for directions? Do you know if there's a magical underground city here, or something like that?

Lupo:
You came from the surface.

Gavial:
Weird thing to say. You didn't?

Eunectes:
We heard something terrible was about to happen underground, so...

Lupo:
You've finally come, surface-dwellers.

Lupo:
'Naturally, those who come with chainsaw and axe in hand can only spell calamity for this pure garden.'

Lupo:
...... 'The beast of civilization finally sheds all pretense of hiding its razor-sharp fangs, baring its gigantic maw before us...'

Gavial:
I see, that makes sense. A wild beast with a huge mouth and razor-sharp teeth. Don't worry, I'll handle this.

Lupo:
Huh? No, that was a rhetorical flourish...

Gavial:
As long as the thing's less than ten meters wide, I'm confident I can take it down clean. Perfect timing too, since I've been itching to get a good workout!

Eunectes:
Mind showing us the way, Miss Lupo? Is it over here?

Gavial:
Maybe it'll be faster if we keep jumping down.

Lupo:
Stop, surface-dwellers! The blood on you will...

Gavial:
Don't worry. I know how to control my strength so it's not going to splatter all over the place.

Gavial:
Zumama, ready for round two?

Eunectes:
Right behind you.

Gavial:
Hold on tight, Miss Lupo.

Eunectes:
You can trust Gavial. She's an expert when it comes to fighting.

Lupo:
Uh, actually, there's another way... Hey? Hey!!
