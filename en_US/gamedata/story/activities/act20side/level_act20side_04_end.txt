Croque Diamondface:
With the results of the referendum, the Great Aquapit will soon complete its historic half-year mission. It will be blown up and turned into construction material once again.

Croque Diamondface:
Citizens, I'm afraid this slightly extended summer carnival will soon come to an end.

Durin:
*sobs*... I'll always remember our beautiful time together forever.

Durin:
But the super slide is so much fun, you can't get enough of it! I never thought we'd have to say goodbye...

Croque Diamondface:
However! In the Great Aquapit's place, we'll have an all-new, prettier, and completely different structure! After all, this is Zeruertza, a city built by the best architectural designers!

Croque Diamondface:
Stitch Canvas and Catch Lightrace are two awe-inspiring, up-and-coming architectural designers. Over the next few months, the two of them will submit their design proposals...

Croque Diamondface:
Imagine the show showdown they have in store for us.

Croque Diamondface:
Hehe, this brings me back to the dome design contest they had a few years ago, when they just made their debuts!

Croque Diamondface:
The duel ended all those years ago without a winner, but who will win the right to design Zeruertza's next landmark? Let us—

Croque Diamondface:
Let me get a sip of water first.

Edge Eartheart:
Croque, I've never seen you so enthusiastic. Have you been drinking?

Croque Diamondface:
No. Not yet, at least.

Edge Eartheart:
Now this isn't like you at all.

Croque Diamondface:
I was watching videos of a competition on the surface that I got from Inam, and it seems they have a role called 'the MC'.

Croque Diamondface:
I thought I might dip into a new career path.

Croque Diamondface:
Anyhow! Although the architects' designs are yet to come, my fellow citizens, the tail end of our summer is going to be a fleeting one!

Croque Diamondface:
Before the slide is blown up, let us enjoy it all we can!

Durin:
Ohhhh!

Tomimi:
Gavial!

Gavial:
Tomimi, watch out! Slow down!

Tomimi:
I was so, so jealous when I heard you guys went to the waterfall in Acahualla!

Tomimi:
Hehe, and this time I get to join in on the fun!

Gavial:
You're such a kid.

Gavial:
Hm? What's wrong? You're usually so careful to hide your tail. Let's see... Did it get thicker again?

Tomimi:
Eh? Nope, not even a little! I checked with a measuring tape before I got here! It's been months since I got any thicker!

Gavial:
Oh? Sounds like you're really hung up on it.

Tomimi:
Waaaahhh... Eat my water blast!

Gavial:
Heh, you little runt! It's on!

Avdotya:
They're more like Durins than you are.

Stitch Canvas:
How would you know what it means to be 'Durin', Lupo?

Avdotya:
You seem a little nervous. Are you worried about your contest with Catch?

Stitch Canvas:
Worried? Over him? Don't make me laugh. I haven't fallen so low. It's just laypeople tend to like his proposals more.

Stitch Canvas:
Mine get their fair share of fans, too. Perhaps I should be bringing something different to the table. That's how I'll win.

Stitch Canvas:
Perhaps I should just... *sigh*! I should probably take my mind off of that right now.

Stitch Canvas:
To tell the truth... if we don't care about aesthetics and just look at how fun it is, this 'Great Aquapit' isn't so bad.

Avdotya:
Oh, so you enjoy these things, too?

Stitch Canvas:
Every now and then.

Catch Lightrace:
Stitch, you're here!

Catch Lightrace:
Want to try out the slide with the downstream speed set to max? It wears the equipment out, so we don't usually get to do it.

Catch Lightrace:
I just tried it a couple times with Elysium. It was amazingly fast!

Catch Lightrace:
It does hurt a little when you hit the water, though. Still, wanna try?

Stitch Canvas:
No, thanks. I'm not one bit interested in fun and games like...

Elysium:
Whooo! Bombs away!

Elysium:
Catch, my brother! This impact force is on another level! Did you see how high that splash went?!

Catch Lightrace:
Maybe we should try something different. Say... see which of us can land with the tiniest splash?

Elysium:
Keep the splashes small? Good idea! Sounds like it won't hurt nearly as bad.

Stitch Canvas:
My sand castle...

Elysium:
(Hey, uh, Catch, did we perhaps... screw up?)

Catch Lightrace:
(Uh, even though this is Stitch we're talking about, he can't possibly be mad over a sand castle, right?)

Elysium:
(He seems rather angry to me, though.)

Catch Lightrace:
(In that case, we should probably...)

Stitch Canvas:
Hey, where are you two going? You're just going to run? Get back here!

Inam:
Yep, you did very well getting everyone going.

Croque Diamondface:
I have your video tapes to thank. That's where I picked it up.

Inam:
Next, we can hold a series of contests to keep the enthusiasm that goes with this 'championship' contest going, then we'll use Catch and Stitch's design contest in a few months to pump everyone up to the max.

Croque Diamondface:
We could print some paper slips for the audience to use to show their support for one side, with prizes given to those who pick the right side.

Inam:
We call those lottery tickets. You're really good at picking things up. Up on the surface, there are merchants who line their pockets by selling them.

Croque Diamondface:
We Durins don't much care for money in that way... Let's have the losing side pay for the winners' drinks for a month!

Croque Diamondface:
Hm, we could make it two months to make things more exciting, too. We'll have to decide with a referendum.

Croque Diamondface:
Later on, perhaps we could issue some more lottery tickets covering how many months' worth of alcohol are owed in the end.

Inam:
I'm starting to worry about the Zeruertzans' future.

Gavial:
Hm, I'm not used to feeling unhelpful.

Eunectes:
What's wrong? Do you have to beat something up to satisfy yourself?

Gavial:
Not really.

Gavial:
Still, if this goes well, Acahualla will get its hands on some Durin. Would've been a totally pointless trip otherwise.

Tomimi:
Gavial may have left home a long time ago, but she actually really cares about Acahualla!

Gavial:
Yeah, I've been to so many different places, but the rainforest is the one place where I feel most at home.

Inam:
Are you going to come back, then?

Gavial:
Not planning on it. Not yet, at least. I still have lots of patients to take care of back at Rhodes Island.

Inam:
There are plenty of Tiacauh who want you to go back. You could think about becoming their lord ameer, even.

Gavial:
Yeah, and they want bananas to sprout straight out of the soil, too. Can't always get what you want.

Inam:
Gavial, you would be the most fitting lord ameer for Acahualla. You are the only one who can rein in each and every Tiacauh.

Inam:
Everyone is awaiting your return.

Inam:
And if you simply cannot do it, then it's ultimately likely... that a lord ameer from the Court of Sargon will come to govern Acahualla instead.

Inam:
And when that happens, Acahualla will no longer be the free land you knew.

Gavial:
But don't we already have you for our Great Chief?

Inam:
There are some things I can't do anything about.

Inam:
I can come up with ideas to help get us in better shape, but I'm not the one who can really bring the Tiacauh together.

Gavial:
It's not like I'm running away from responsibility here, Inam.

Gavial:
It's just... I haven't thought through how to actually do it.

Eunectes:
You know how to think? Color me surprised.

Gavial:
Hey, Zumama, you picking a fight?!

Eunectes:
What I'm saying is, you usually do stuff without thinking.

Gavial:
And that's fine when it's just me, but this is about all those Tiacauh...

Catch Lightrace:
All good things must come to an end. Isn't that right? So this giant slide will be torn down for something new.

Catch Lightrace:
I actually didn't catch much of what you were talking about. All I want to say is, my friends, let me get a picture of all of you together while it's still standing.

Gavial:
Haha, alright, let's toss all this complicated stuff aside for now.

Gavial:
Right now, we gotta have fun!

Gavial:
Tomimi, you gimme a smile, too!

Catch Lightrace:
Looks like you've mastered the Durin philosophy.

Gavial:
Well, it's not often we get a vacation. As if I'm gonna waste it!

Catch Lightrace:
Well said! Here's to you! How about some berry tomato wine? It's on me.

Gavial:
Nah, I'll have to pass on that.

Elysium:
My, what a graceful way to disappear.

Stitch Canvas:
Here I thought you would pass out from all that drink and miss the demolition.

Elysium:
Haha, I know how to have a good time.

Elysium:
Though, at times like these, I generally keep myself clearheaded.

Elysium:
That's the most basic respect I have for things as they fade away.

Stitch Canvas:
Whoa, were you actually a secret genius? That would be such a cheap cliche, even in the Zeruertzan library.

Elysium:
Oh, you little rascal!

Catch Lightrace:
Stitch.

Stitch Canvas:
Catch...

Catch Lightrace:
It's time we got serious. Let's both do our best, fair and square.

Catch Lightrace:
Shake hands if you agree?

Stitch Canvas:
Alright... Out of the most basic respect for another Zeruertzan.

Elysium:
Say, you two actually get along pretty well, don't you?

Stitch Canvas:
What, are you blind?! Where'd you get that idea?

Croque Diamondface:
Now, things are going to get real from here on out!

Stitch Canvas:
Has Croque been drinking...?

Croque Diamondface:
The warm-up of warm-ups, the prelude to preludes! The first season of the Zeruertza Competition Series!

Croque Diamondface:
*Drumroll*—Ta-dah! A swimming contest!

Croque Diamondface:
How about it?
