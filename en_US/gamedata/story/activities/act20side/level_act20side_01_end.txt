Inam:
No need to be shy, Tomimi. It looks great on you.

Tomimi:
R-Really?

Tomimi:
Ehehe, I loved this swimsuit the moment I laid eyes on it. It's exactly my style!

Inam:
The tailors here sure are something. They managed to custom-make something to fit your figure so quickly.

Tomimi:
I-is there something wrong with my figure? I've been working out a lot harder!

Inam:
Don't worry. You look super cute.

Tomimi:
Phew, that's good then. I don't want people making fun of my tail getting thicker again... Inam, you're not going to pick out a swimsuit?

Inam:
I'm good. I'm more interested in the buckethead that was helping out the tailor just now.

Inam:
Durin technology...

Elysium:
That's some crazy good stuff!

Elysium:
I've never had liquor this good before!

Tipsy Durin:
Cheers, brother! Let's drink to your health!

Elysium:
A toast to our health! Long live Old Karl Mead!

Inam:
Hey, Tomimi, about that Elysium guy... Is he actually reliable?

Tomimi:
Now that you mention it, there are Durin operators at Rhodes Island, but they seem to never talk about where they came from.

Inam:
Do you think the Durins might be hiding something?

Tomimi:
No, I think they just don't care a whole lot. They always seem a lot more concerned about what's on the menu in the canteen.

Inam:
I never thought we'd get the opportunity to explore an underground Durin city.

Tomimi:
Yeah. This might be a great opportunity to spread Gavial's name to the Durin people as well...

Inam:
You didn't drag Gavial, Zumama, and Kemar with you on vacation this time?

Tomimi:
Kemar said she wanted to practice boxing with Blaze. Gavial and Zumama went on a mission and haven't come back yet.

Tomimi:
I wrote them a letter before I left, telling what you learned from Mr. Stitch, as well as what he told us.

Tomimi:
They could've taken the opportunity to go back to Acahualla for a break...

Inam:
The three of you went and made me Great Chief without a second thought, and it's about time you all came back to see what I've gotten done.

Inam:
By the way, while you were at Rhodes Island, did anybody find this Elysium guy a little annoying?

Elysium:
Waheeeey, it's a completely different experience!

Piss-Drunk Durin:
You, tall guy, I saw you hanging out with those mead boys just now. Listen up, that stuff's for kids!

Piss-Drunk Durin:
If you want the REAL good booze, turn your eyes toward our No. 7 Whiskey. Here, cheers.

Elysium:
Cheers!

Elysium:
This aroma... it's like the rainforest after a thunderstorm, the smell of moss in an underground cave!

Piss-Drunk Durin:
Oh. Sorry, that's just the wood cup getting a little moldy.

Inam:
He seems to be enjoying himself.

Tomimi:
Oh, Inam, you still haven't told me about how you met Mr. Stitch.

Inam:
Hm... It's a bit of a long story.

Excited Archosauria:
Great Chief, the big things you brought with you last time were really stimulating! Just standing in front of them kept me up for days!

Excited Archosauria:
My wife's been nagging me day in and day out about how these things are gonna snatch away my soul or something!

Inam:
We're talking about those heaps of junk from Columbia, right? Are those metal choppers that big of a deal?

Excited Archosauria:
You bet they are! A legendary construction device, those things are, a machine of machines! Have you ever felt the joy of watching those things work right in front of you? My heart's never pounded so hard, not even when I first met my wife!

Inam:
Huh... Guess I'll have someone stop by to put shock absorbers on your chopper one of these days.

Inam:
Tomimi's going to be back in a few days, so we've got to get ready to pick her up.

No Longer Excited Archosauria:
Picking up Tomimi? I can imagine how much work that's going to take.

Groaning Archosauria:
It's probably about as bad as getting beaten up by a metal chopper.

No Longer Excited Archosauria:
Who knows how many trinkets and doodads she'll bring back with her? Do you remember how many men we needed to grab all her stuff last time?

No Longer Excited Archosauria:
At first, I thought it was a whole caravan!

Groaning Archosauria:
Tomimi's always been like that, ever since she was little. Always hoarding whatever junk she gets her hands on...

Groaning Archosauria:
Don't you think it's gotten worse since she went to Rhodes Island?

No Longer Excited Archosauria:
I have no idea why she had to lug back that plate of sheet metal. The one Gavial put a hole through.

Groaning Archosauria:
I heard she couldn't find a place to put it in her place at Rhodes Island.

Inam:
Wait, who's that up ahead?

???:
Call me mad, signing up for this kind of abuse. First it was those topsy-turvy caves, now it's this godforsaken place.

???:
But that old man Eartheart drives me up the wall. Just clogs up the doorway and nags you all day... Gah, damn these stupid vines! And that accursed sunlight!

???:
I've always said artificial lighting is much better than this crap!

???:
......

???:
I'm so thirsty... And tired.

???:
I can't fathom why the Master would leave Zeruertza. Is he a masochist or something?

Inam:
A little kid?

A little kid?:
Who are you calling a kid? You're the kid!

Inam:
Huh, you've got a pretty funny accent. Who taught you?

A little kid?:
I taught myself. Got a problem with that?

Inam:
Kids ought to mind their manners and be patient with strangers.

Archosauria:
What a funny-looking fella. Kind of familiar, though, anyone like this been around Acahualla? Did someone's kid go missing?

Archosauria:
Not a thick-tail, or a thin-tail...

Inam:
Not a Liberi, or a Phidia either. Wait, hold on, could you be...?

Inam:
A Durin?

Archosauria:
What's a Durin? Can you eat it?

Inam:
I've only read about them in magazines, but apparently Durins are a mysterious race of people who live underground.

Archosauria:
You mean a metal crab?

Maybe a Metal Crab?:
No, you're the metal crab! Wanna fight?!

Archosauria:
Oh, I remember now! There was an article in 'Stranger Things' a few years ago about how the Durins were really good at making alcohol! That's something metal crabs can't do.

Archosauria:
At best, metal crabs might get drunk off of eating fermented fruits.

Inam:
They also don't live underground. They just cover themselves with dirt.

Not a Metal Crab:
That's not what matters!

Not a Metal Crab:
*sigh*... I knew it. You surface-dwellers are just a bunch of short-sighted egomaniacs who keep running their mouths despite not knowing anything.

Not a Metal Crab:
You people even make Durins look smart.

Not a Metal Crab:
Gah, beyond all that though, your aesthetic sensibilities are compelte trash.

Inam:
Hey, little Durin, I'll have you know— I'm wearing Sargon's chicest styles.

Pint-Sized Durin:
If that's your idea of 'chic,' then it's all the proof I need that everyone up here has trash taste. What is the point in going along with aesthetic merit determined by someone else? You might as well be a lowly pleb.

Archosauria:
Great Chief, I think this kid might have a few screws loose. Need me to fix him up?

Inam:
He's still got a long life ahead of him. Let him be.

Pint-Sized Durin:
I matured a long time ago, thank you very much!

Mature Durin:
Ugh... Why am I even wasting time talking to these ignoramuses? Farewell.

Archosauria:
Oh. There he goes.

Archosauria:
Hmm? He stopped again?

Mature Durin:
Uhh...

Mature Durin:
Ahem... Uhh, if I may ask a small favor, surface-dwellers...

Mature Durin:
Can I have some water?

Tomimi:
So, the rest is pretty much what you wrote in the letter? He said that a Durin city is in trouble and needs our help?

Inam:
At least, that's what Stitch said at the time.

Elysium:
Well, uhh, the drinks here being way too good can be troublesome. Might end up under the table if you're not careful, but that would NEVER happen to me. Cheers!

Elysium:
This is probably that unsociable little rascal's roundabout way of inviting us to see his beautiful home, and I can totally understand that sentiment.

Inam:
Not everyone's brain is fried like yours, Elysium.

Inam:
Stitch stayed with us for a month, and one day, he was pestering a group of Archosauria building a train.

Inam:
He said, uh, 'You folks are good enough! These bits of iron and copper you've soldered together might be able to help me! Want to come down to Zeruertza to have a look?'

Inam:
Though Stitch was definitely exaggerating the scope of the crisis, I... was actually curious to see if there's any business to be done with our underground neighbors.

Tomimi:
Good idea!

Inam:
If Acahualla ever wants to escape its savage, brutish state, it'll need every opportunity it can get. I heard the Durins are exceptional at smelting and smithing. If we could do them a favor, we might be able to get a thing or two in return...

Inam:
You folks won't have to get all excited over a few bits of scrap metal anymore.

Tomimi:
Inam... I didn't expect you to be such an upstanding Great Chief! I thought you'd just blow all your money in the city every day.

Inam:
You brat. Is that how you think of me?

Inam:
If Acahualla wants to develop, the most important thing it needs is money. Doesn't matter if it's Sargonian coins, Columbian bills, or Victorian pounds. We need them all.

Inam:
But with Acahualla's current manufacturing output – some shoddy handmade products, a bit of unrefined ore, we barely have enough money for people to live decently, let alone think about getting rich.

Inam:
Luckily, you don't have to worry about how the city defines 'living decently.'

Inam:
That said, there's a difference between money and wealth. Sitting on a stack of money doesn't accomplish anything, but once you get it into circulation, then it becomes 'wealth.'

Inam:
Acahualla is already on the up and up. But to become even better, it needs opportunity.

Inam:
For example, a technological partnership with the Durins.

Tomimi:
Hmm, this is a bit beyond me... All I know is, whenever I run into a problem, I throw some Arts at it! If that doesn't work, I can always whack it with my staff!

Tomimi:
That's the 'Gavial's Will' way of life!

Inam:
Hahaha! Even after working with Rhodes Island for so long, you still can't leave your roots behind, huh?

Inam:
But, uhh, the best that I can do is some tinkering around the edges. For Acahualla to truly develop, we still need a 'leader.'

Tomimi:
But Inam, aren't you already the Great Chief?

Inam:
A leader is someone who can truly unite the Tiacauh. Am I gonna do that? A little too troublesome for me.

Inam:
I'd rather go shopping in the city.

Elysium:
I like the way you think! I'm quite fond of shopping myself, but nothing beats the great outdoors, *hic*!

Elysium:
By the way, I haven't seen our little motor-mouthed friend for quite some time. Did he sneak off somewhere?

Tomimi:
Seems like it...

Inam:
I'd assume he went to set something up?

Inam:
Oh, right, but since we're right in front of the big water slide... It wouldn't hurt to enjoy our vacation first, right?

Tomimi:
I, I think the Yanese Operators at Rhodes Island have a saying for this! It goes something like... uhh, 'the host plans, and the guests follow'?

Tomimi:
I think that means... Since the host isn't here, we can do whatever we want.

Elysium:
*hic*! Well said! I'll drink again to that pearl of wisdom!

Elysium:
Race you to the foot of the slide, my friends!

Tomimi:
Elysium really is getting used to the Durin lifestyle a bit too quickly...

Stitch Canvas:
*pant* *pant*... Finally shook off that rabble of drunkards.

Stitch Canvas:
That's why I can't stand these soulless Durins! What are these idiots wasting their precious lives on?!

Stitch Canvas:
I've only been away for a month, and Zeruertza's already turned into a terrible eyesore. Dammit! I never should've come back!

Stitch Canvas:
And as for those stupid surface-dwellers... Gah, as long as they can build me a railway bridge that won't collapse, I suppose I can compromise my standards a bit more.

Elderly Durin:
Stitch? You really came back to us! Word was going around about a teetotaler Durin wandering Zeruertza. I knew it had to be you!

Stitch Canvas:
Edge Eartheart... You're never going to leave me alone, are you?

Edge Eartheart:
Where have you been all this time? I was running all over looking for you. I wore out my old bones searching around that cave-in!

Stitch Canvas:
Your old bones are harder than rock. I, on the other hand, nearly died.

Edge Eartheart:
Don't tell me, you... went to the surface?!

Stitch Canvas:
What, you got a problem?

Edge Eartheart:
I can't believe you did that, Stitch.

Edge Eartheart:
You, you're too gutsy for your own good. I never imagined you'd...

Edge Eartheart:
Actually manage to do something useful! Hurry, let me see what fancy goodies you brought back!

Edge Eartheart:
The network of caves above the lift is way too hard to navigate, and I have no clue where my map went. Nobody's been up there in years!

Edge Eartheart:
You remembered to bring me a souvenir, right? Or maybe some exotic ore specimens? Some fermentable surface plants? The latest issue of 'Stranger Things'?! The ones they have at the library are all out-of-date.

Stitch Canvas:
No, uhh, how should I put this...?

Stitch Canvas:
I brought a few people back.

Edge Eartheart:
Huh?

Contemplative Lupo:
'Thus, she decided...'

Contemplative Lupo:
'She decided on Old Karl Mead!'

Contemplative Lupo:
Ugh, that's not good enough. Maybe the product placement should come a bit earlier? Let me revise that a bit...

Contemplative Lupo:
'Cheaper than cheap. Crazier than crazy!'

Contemplative Lupo:
'If you need a place to cut loose, have a great time, and, of course, enjoy a sip of some soul-soothing mead—'

Contemplative Lupo:
'Look no further than Zeruertza and our famed Old Karl Mead!'

Contemplative Lupo:
Good. Concise, straightforward, and lavish in praise. The client should be satisfied with this. Hopefully.
