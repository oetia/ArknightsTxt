Edge Eartheart:
Ahem. Citizens of Zeruertza, I am your environment and climate representative, Edge Eartheart.

Edge Eartheart:
We are here today to discuss the future of Zeruertza.

Edge Eartheart:
The survey results are back, and the representatives have discussed a few possible solutions. We will make our choice from these options today.

Edge Eartheart:
We also hope to come up with an answer for how the city will move forward.

Edge Eartheart:
However, today's meeting will be officiated by Avdotya.

Croque Diamondface:
Are you sure about this, Avdotya?

Croque Diamondface:
Sure, you've lived in Zeruertza for quite a while, and the people in town know you. But this is the first time you'll be standing before everyone, right?

Avdotya:
Yes.

Edge Eartheart:
Alright, you're up, Avdotya.

Avdotya:
I might take some time, Master Edge. Is that okay?

Edge Eartheart:
Don't worry, you won't break my record of putting half the city to sleep.

Avdotya:
I've never heard that story.

Croque Diamondface:
Oh, I remember. Master Eartheart went into a long discourse about geology.

Croque Diamondface:
He went on and on until the sun went down, and only stopped when he wore himself out.

Avdotya:
I probably won't go THAT long.

Edge Eartheart:
Go, Avdotya. This is the culmination of the time you spent here as our resident surface-born.

Avdotya:
Thank you. Here goes.

Voice from Far Away:
It's Avdotya!

Voice from Far Away:
Avdotya! I'm with you, no matter what you say!

Edge Eartheart:
Why don't my speeches get the same reception?

Deculture Silvermint:
It's not just your record-breaking speech. All the other meetings you officiate last for ages.

Edge Eartheart:
I know you're always the first to fall asleep.

Deculture Silvermint:
Not today. Avdotya looks different this time. What does she have on her mind?

Excited Durin:
Fantastic. I respect Master Edge's knowledge, but his meetings are torturous.

Relaxed Durin:
Avdotya's voice is as beautiful as she is. I could listen to her all day.

Avdotya:
Greetings, citizens of Zeruertza. I am Avdotya, literature representative.

Avdotya:
Today, I officiate over this meeting that will determine Zeruertza's future.

Avdotya:
We have discussed with Master Edge and believe that there are three practical plans to carry out Zeruertza's evacuation.

Avdotya:
Before discussing the plans, however, there's something else that I want to talk about.

Avdotya:
It's about my past.

Avdotya:
Not the past of Avdotya Razorpen, but the past of Avdotya Nikolayevna Ivanova.

Avdotya:
When I first came to live among the Durins, I created many stories, and shared mine with many people.

Avdotya:
This, however, I've never told anyone.

Avdotya:
I want to share it with you today.

Avdotya:
......

Avdotya:
I was born to a noble family in Ursus.

Avdotya thought she would struggle to find words.

But she found her memories pouring out as soon as she opened her mouth.

It was not that she did not know what to say; it was that she had too much to say and did not know where to start.

The Durins do not know what it means for her. But she does.

This is the first time she's looked back on her past since coming to the Durins.

She thought time would let the past fade, let her forget that she was once a woman of Ursus.

Now, though, she realizes that the past never truly goes away.

But meeting Gavial and the people she brought with her helps her realize—

That is not so bad.

The past pulls her down bit by bit, along with the Durins listening to her story.

But she no longer feels pain from it, and thus neither do the Durins.

Stitch sits in his room, trying not to think about it.

But he can't help it.

He knows this is his last chance.

Let it go, and he will never surpass his teacher.

And he has a feeling that if he does not win this time, he will always be second-best, though to what he cannot describe.

He knows.

But he can't do it.

He puts his arms around his head.

Knock knock.

There is someone knocking on his door.

Gavial:
Stitch, you're here, right?

Stitch Canvas:
......

Gavial:
I know you're in there.

Stitch Canvas:
Leave me alone, Gavial!

Gavial:
We need to talk.

Stitch Canvas:
Talk to Catch if this is about the dome.

Gavial:
No can do.

Stitch Canvas:
Why?

Gavial:
Because this is your job.

Gavial:
Open the door.

Stitch Canvas:
You're not coming in here!

Gavial:
That's not up to you.

The door and the walls around it collapse with a bang, and Gavial walks in casually holding her great axe.

She sees Stich sitting by the desk with his arms around his head, his expression hidden.

A few blank pieces of paper lie by his hand.

A few more pieces of paper lie by his feet, either torn to pieces or crumpled up.

Gavial:
Design sketches for the dome.

Gavial:
You wanted to do it, didn't you?

Stitch Canvas:
Can't you give me a break, Gavial?

Gavial:
It's not so much that I'm not giving you a break...

Gavial:
Look at you, shutting yourself in this room staring at sketches, holding in everything you're thinking.

Gavial:
You're the one who's not giving yourself a break, Stitch.

Stitch Canvas:
You don't know anything...

Gavial:
Right, which is why I'm not taking you back by force.

Gavial:
I don't know. So I gotta find out.

Stitch Canvas:
Why did you smash my door then?

Gavial:
You wouldn't have talked if I didn't.

Stitch Canvas:
You're just threatening me...

Gavial:
I'm a reasonable woman. I could even be convinced to help you, if you have a good enough reason.

Stitch Canvas:
......

Gavial:
I realized something, on my way over here

Gavial:
You weren't happy with the whole dome repair thing, were you? From the very beginning?

Stitch Canvas:
......

Croque Diamondface:
Life on the surface can be so colorful. I never heard Avdotya talk about it... right, Master Edge?

Edge Eartheart:
Huh? Mm.

Croque Diamondface:
It's nothing. Rare to see you drift off like this, though. What's the matter?

Edge Eartheart:
I was thinking about Stitch.

Croque Diamondface:
Stitch? Aren't Gavial and Catch looking for him? Ought to be fine, right?

Edge Eartheart:
The question isn't fine or not.

Edge Eartheart:
Seeing him today made me realize I may have pushed him too hard without realizing.

Croque Diamondface:
You're talking about the dome repair?

Edge Eartheart:
Yes.

Edge Eartheart:
Of course, I was in agreement about not repairing the dome.

Edge Eartheart:
But I was also anxious about the broken survey equipment.

Edge Eartheart:
You know how Stitch has been since his teacher went missing.

Edge Eartheart:
He submitted a series of proposals for the dome that got rejected. At some point he stopped coming to design meetings, shuttering up in his room.

Edge Eartheart:
I thought I could push him a little... if he could come up with a new plan to repair the dome, it would be an opportunity to bring it up.

Edge Eartheart:
I could help him.

Croque Diamondface:
He ended up going up to get surface-dwellers to fix the railway.

Edge Eartheart:
Yeah, I didn't expect him to go this far to avoid fixing the dome.

Edge Eartheart:
So I thought, forget it, the Originium vein takes priority.

Edge Eartheart:
If he's so reluctant to repair it, just let it be; there will be more chances in the future.

Edge Eartheart:
Little did I know there would be no more chances.

Croque Diamondface:
This isn't your fault. If anything, it's Stitch's for running away.

Edge Eartheart:
But if this dome is so important to him—

Edge Eartheart:
He'll regret it for the rest of his life, if he doesn't seize the opportunity.

Gavial:
Why are you so against repairing the dome?

Stitch Canvas:
Because of the job my teacher left me.

Gavial:
Teacher? Job? Didn't Catch say your teacher went missing?

Stitch Canvas:
It wasn't... a sudden disappearance.

Stitch Canvas:
Though he didn't tell anyone else, he did leave me an assignment.

Stitch Canvas:
I have to win everyone over with my dome design, and make the dome of Zeruertza my own.

Stitch Canvas:
Only then will he come back to find me.

Stitch Canvas:
Otherwise, he'll never come back.

Gavial:
Your last name is Canvas too. Are you related?

Stitch Canvas:
No, I changed it later.

Stitch Canvas:
Eight years ago, I survived an Originium vein explosion. I had no home to return to, but my teacher took me in.

Gavial:
So your Oripathy...

Stitch Canvas:
Yes, that was when I caught it.

Stitch Canvas:
On the surface, people with this disease are called the Infected and cast out from society.

Stitch Canvas:
That's not the case among the Durins, but we can't fully cure it, only keep its symptoms in check.

Gavial:
It's the same up there.

Stitch Canvas:
So I changed my name to that of my mentor and studied architecture under him.

Gavial:
I hear he was pretty famous?

Stitch Canvas:
Of course! Finch Canvas was the design representative of Zeruertza.

Stitch Canvas:
Surface-dwellers would call our style 'minimalist'.

Stitch Canvas:
We oppose elaborate and flashy designs, seeing them as the unchecked spread of desire, the product of a slothful life.

Stitch Canvas:
At this rate, we will inevitably be swallowed up by our own desire.

Stitch Canvas:
That's why we advocate a lifestyle that emphasizes the true nature of things.

Gavial:
True nature?

Stitch Canvas:
How things are in their most natural state. We oppose all unnecessary functions, trying to keep things the way they are.

Stitch Canvas:
This is our rebellion against a life of desire.

Gavial:
Like the simple design of your room?

Stitch Canvas:
......

Stitch Canvas:
No, my style is not exactly the same as that of my teacher.

Stitch Canvas:
My style came from his, but in some ways, we go in opposite directions.

Stitch Canvas:
Allowing the city to welcome destruction while looking its best is a luxury that comes only from our excess productivity. It is arrogant and wasteful.

Stitch Canvas:
One's time is limited, and my clock is ticking!

Stitch Canvas:
You're Infected too, Gavial. Don't you understand?

Stitch Canvas:
You only have so much time left. You need to spend your efforts on something more meaningful.

Gavial:
Of course. That's why I study medicine, so I can heal myself and people like me.

Gavial:
But if that's how you feel, why not seize this last chance?

Stitch Canvas:
You think I don't want to?

Stitch Canvas:
Do you see the sketches here?

Stitch Canvas:
They are proof of my failure over the years!

Stitch Canvas:
I made proposal after proposal, only to see all of them rejected!

Stitch Canvas:
After that, I couldn't even come up with a passable sketch.

Stitch Canvas:
I don't know who is the problem: the Zeruertzans, or me.

Stitch Canvas:
All I know is that the mere sight of the dome fills me with fear.

Stitch Canvas:
It's like a cage that my teacher has locked me in, trapping me forever.

Stitch Canvas:
Even if it's my last chance.

Stitch Canvas:
I can't do it anymore!

Stitch Canvas:
Even if I came up with a new plan, there's no hope of it getting through.

Stitch Canvas:
And you tell me how I'm going to come up with a new plan that can pass review in such a short time?!

Gavial:
......

Stitch Canvas:
I'm not coming with you, Gavial.

Stitch Canvas:
I'm a failure.

Stitch Canvas:
Tell Master Edge that if he wants the dome fixed, he can have Catch do it.

Stitch Canvas:
He'll undoubtedly do a better job than I can.

Gavial:
Alright, I get it now.

Gavial:
All the more important for you to come with me.

Stitch Canvas:
Haven't you been listening?

Gavial:
Yep.

Gavial:
But you're the one who's got to explain it to the gang.

Stitch Canvas:
Ugh...

Strange Machine A:
Stitch is in danger. Stitch is in danger.

Strange Machine B:
Protect Stitch. Protect Stitch.

Gavial:
Hey, where did these bots come fr—

Stitch Canvas:
—!

Gavial:
Stop right there!
