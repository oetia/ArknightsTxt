A few days later...

Stitch is working hard at the forum again today.

Just like the journey to the surface, the dressing of the city is a task that requires the supervision of all the citizens.

And as the face of the city, the dome's renovation is naturally the most important task.

Which is why it is also necessary for the design tasks to be done in the forum, where everyone can see.

And as Master Edge claims, it also saves time.

Stitch Canvas:
That darned old man. He's definitely having me do this because he thinks it's funny.

Noticing Edge's smug look below, Stitch finds himself immediately incensed.

However, not even he himself expected to adapt so quickly to these work conditions.

When he has to take questions from passersby, when he has to hear opinions, and even when he stands up and defends his beliefs in an argument—

None of that actually carries as much pressure as he thought it would.

With Edge grinning away at him, Stitch is definitely irritated, but he also knows what people must be thinking about him.

Just like how they must know what he is thinking.

Edge Eartheart:
This little runt. He's had more arguments than I could count the past few days.

Edge Eartheart:
Just because someone dared to give him some feedback, he had to argue for the better part of the day.

Edge Eartheart:
Still, the work he's turning in is impeccable.

Edge Eartheart:
Finch, I don't know where in the world you've tromped off to, but you can rest easy now.

Edge Eartheart:
Oh, right, right.

Edge Eartheart:
Stitch!

Stitch Canvas:
What is it? I'm working here!

Edge Eartheart:
Somebody found a letter at the top of the dome while it was being inspected.

Stitch Canvas:
A letter?

Catch Lightrace:
Yep, and it's for you.

Stitch Canvas:
No way...!

Deculture Silvermint:
Sorry, Catch.

Catch Lightrace:
Hm?

Deculture Silvermint:
If only I were more like you...

Catch Lightrace:
Everyone's personality is different, and I can understand the way you think, too.

Catch Lightrace:
All I can say is, if I'd found out a little sooner, maybe things could've turned out different.

Deculture Silvermint:
You're allowed to stay, you know.

Catch Lightrace:
It's fine.

Elysium:
*Sigh*, it feels like I did something terrible to you.

Catch Lightrace:
Not at all, Elysium. I really appreciate your suggestion.

Catch Lightrace:
It's true that I made this decision to give him that push at first, but I also really want to seek out Master Finch.

Catch Lightrace:
I'm sure he'll be very happy to hear how Stitch is doing.

Elysium:
Well, you've made it plenty hard for me to know what to say here.

Elysium:
Speaking of which, it sounds like this Master Finch really cares about his student. I have a hunch that he might have gone to the surface to seek a cure for Oripathy.

Elysium:
After I leave, I will try my best to track him down, too.

Elysium:
Hah, perhaps he will one day find his way to Rhodes Island.

Catch Lightrace:
Oh, now there's a plan.

Elysium:
You know what I'm trying to say, right?

Catch Lightrace:
Yeah, we'll meet again.

Catch Lightrace:
I know I want to help out when we finally rebuild Zeruertza.

Catch Lightrace:
And when the time comes, I am going to work together with Stitch to put out some amazing designs.

Elysium:
Like a statue of me?

Catch Lightrace:
Well... Maybe not that.

Elysium:
A shame!

Excited Archosauria:
Here we go, let's pull it together. Our job today is the blow all the caverns in this area!

Yota:
You hear that, Yogi?

Yogi:
Yes, Brother!

Inam:
*yawn*, Yota, did you have to start working this early?

Yota:
What are you talking about, Inam?

Yota:
This is a mission Gavial gave us herself.

Yota:
She saved my life. If I could, I would dig through the earth to meet her right now and check how she's been doing.

Inam:
She'll still be alive and kicking, well after you're dead.

Yota:
Haha, that's for sure.

Inam:
Right, I'll be leaving tomorrow to meet the Pasha and discuss the lord ameer business.

Inam:
So, starting tomorrow, Zumama's in charge. Got it?

Yogi:
How about I come with you, then?

Yogi:
Didn't you say the Pasha is a pain to deal with?

Inam:
For you, yeah. The Pasha would grind you until there's nothing left.

Inam:
Don't worry. I haven't been a Messenger all these years for nothing.

Inam:
Alright, Zumama, I'll leave this to you.

Eunectes:
Don't worry.

Eunectes:
We've installed the 'Mountain Breaker Mk. III' on the Raging Ironhide.

Eunectes:
That'll put its efficiency up three-fold.

Eunectes:
You could even leave me this whole place.

Inam:
Sometimes... I feel like you're even scarier than Gavial.

Croque Diamondface:
By the way, Avdotya. What are you going to do once you make it to the surface?

Avdotya:
What else can I do?

Avdotya:
You can't believe I will settle down for a life on land just because of the speech I gave?

Avdotya:
Once Zeruertza is rebuilt, I will be back.

Avdotya:
Is there a problem?

Croque Diamondface:
Right... Actually, this only just came back to me, but I made a promise to Inam.

Croque Diamondface:
We agreed that if I ever went to the surface, I would do business with her, and she would also introduce me to a place called Rhodes Island.

Croque Diamondface:
But I don't know that much about the surface, so I told her you would be our middleman, and I could learn from you.

Avdotya:
So that means...

Avdotya:
You sold me to her?!

Croque Diamondface:
I'm sorry! But I really want to try doing business on the surface. Please, help me out!

Croque Diamondface:
I'm really, really sorry!

Gavial:
Phew, this pillar will look just fine here.

Gavial:
I didn't expect them to want to renovate the forum, too. The Durins are a thorough bunch, aren't they?

High Priest:
Gavial.

Gavial:
Hm?

High Priest:
Do you realize that you are making history?

Gavial:
Is that right?

High Priest:
The Durins have lived underground for ages without making any large-scale effort at communicating with the world on the surface.

High Priest:
Yet your choices have persuaded an entire city to relocate to the surface all at once.

High Priest:
Who would have thought that Acahualla would be the first place to know such an intimate level of exchange with a Durin city and its people?

High Priest:
And when future generations look back, it will probably never occur to them that this all happened because of an offhand idea you came up with.

Gavial:
Now that you mention it, I guess you're right.

Gavial:
But there's nothing wrong with that, is there?

High Priest:
Haha, there's of course nothing wrong with that.

High Priest:
What I'm saying is—History is always like that, Gavial.

High Priest:
It might have been an accident that the Durins were able to put down roots underground, too.

High Priest:
This goes to show that perhaps history is nothing to be revered or feared, just like the Acahuallan traditions that you so easily destroyed.

Gavial:
Now I'm not so sure about that. I think people who know their history pretty great.

Gavial:
Like Dr. Kal'tsit. She knows history like the back of her hand.

High Priest:
Kal'tsit? Hm... I could count the number of times we've dealt with each other on one hand, but she might be the one person in the whole world who takes history the lightest.

Gavial:
Is that right?

High Priest:
Of course. And I suspect the way she goes about it might even be a kind of helplessness, the kind that comes from knowing nothing can be done.

High Priest:
Now then, let's change the subject.

High Priest:
Zumama told me that you wavered in your decision, but you persisted with it nonetheless, and that you plan to continue doing as much?

Gavial:
Yeah, I mean, they all told me that they'll help me.

Gavial:
Speaking of, you're gonna stick with us till the end, right, old man?

High Priest:
Oh, look at you, won't even give an old man a break.

High Priest:
It's probably obvious that I'm very happy to be researching technology with Zumama.

High Priest:
But did you know that the longer you live, the harder it is to find direction?

Gavial:
I'm not sure I get it.

High Priest:
Well, that's good. That's what I like about you.

High Priest:
Keep going down the path you're on. I'm curious just how far you'll make it.

Gavial:
So, how come you're here to talk to me instead of following Zumama around?

High Priest:
I told her the Durin machines are nowhere near as cute as the Big, Ugly Thing, and she got mad at me.

High Priest:
Hmph, how could she be this protective of her new friends? Now I'm mad too!

Gavial:
Oh.

Gavial:
Whoa, Tomimi, you feel that?

Tomimi:
Yeah, it's shaking.

Gavial:
I'm surprised we can still feel it even though we've taken the lift all the way up here.

Gavial:
Those are some huge tremors.

Tomimi:
But all the Zeruertzans have made it to the surface. Every last one of them!

Gavial:
Yeah, everyone's done a great job.

Avdotya:
Hrrrhhh...

Gavial:
You okay? I told you to drop the tough act, but you had to be the last one to leave the city.

Gavial:
What inspiration can you get from watching it crumble anyway?

Avdotya:
You wouldn't understand, even if I told you.

Avdotya:
That was the final moment of an entire city. It simply... overwhelmed me with emotion.

Stitch Canvas:
Master... This might be impossibly difficult, but I will give it my best shot.

Gavial:
And you, little whelp. What are you mumbling to yourself?

Tomimi:
He... He looks exhausted.

Gavial:
Well, can you blame him? He's been working really hard.

Gavial:
Not only did he actually manage to design the thing, he went to the construction site every day, and even insisted on being the last one out.

Gavial:
A while back, I wouldn't have expected him to be such a responsible guy.

Tomimi:
Yeah, I'm starting to see him in a different light, too!

Gavial:
Alright, let's go.

Gavial:
We're the last ones. Everyone's waiting for us.

Tomimi:
Mm-hm!

Yogi:
How come Gavial isn't back yet? She didn't get into trouble, did she?

Yota:
Don't jinx it!

Eunectes:
She's here.

Croque Diamondface:
Now where is Avdotya? I'm eager to see the waterfall.

Deculture Silvermint:
You could go on ahead.

Croque Diamondface:
Now that won't do. This is a... how do you say this? Right, a historic moment!

A large crowd of Durins and Tiacauh have gathered in front of the mine.

They are all waiting for the last group to ride the elevator to the surface.

Wearing her usual smile, Gavial steps out with Stitch in tow.

She raises her right hand and greets the crowd, all of whom are beaming.

Gavial:
Today's a good day, everybody. Let's head to the lake for some fun!

Before she can finish her sentence, the crowd has already erupted in cheers.

Today, Acahualla is a tad bit more lively than before.

And in the future, it might get even livelier.
