Months ago, after contacting Reunion

10:14 P.M. \ Clear

Ursus, unnamed desert outskirts

Hoederer:
...You've met all the Reunion leaders.

Hoederer:
What'd you think?

W:
Are you asking me, or her?

W:
If you ask me, I'd say nothing out of the ordinary. The stuff they do is pretty par for the course for people like that.

Ines:
A strange bunch. There's a child who seems to been purposefully pushed into that position to the point of becoming cruel, and then there's a warrior whose toughness is beyond imagination.

W:
There are some incredible people, but then there are also some two-bit villains.

W:
All I can say is, we've seen all kinds of people after fighting wars all these years.

Ines:
But, there is someone who caught my eye...

W:
Oh, you must be talking about that one. The one who was waiting at the side with that other little rabbit.

Ines:
Their squad seemed on a completely different level compared to those ordinary Infected. That kind of Sarkaz warrior can be said to truly bear the mark of war.

Hoederer:
Sarkaz...?

W:
Yeah, but you don't see Sarkaz like that every day. He claims to be with Ursus, saying he broke off contact with Kazdel long ago.

W:
How pitiful. He never needed to live such an exhausting life.

Ines:
Maybe we should all go meet him.

Ines:
The impression I got from him... was that he has become much more than a 'warrior.'

Ines:
And you, don't you love thinking about things? Instead of philosophizing, why not have a chat with someone like that?

Ines:
We might all learn a lot from him.

Hoederer:
You're talking about...

???:
Pardon. I would like to. Speak with you alone.

W:
...Speak of the devil. What's up?

Hoederer:
To who do I owe the pleasure?

???:
My name. Does not matter. For the time being.

???:
Rest assured. Right now, I am not. Here on behalf of the leader.

???:
I just want to hear...

???:
About my countrymen. About my homeland. What has become of them.

???:
I know that, in Kazdel. Many things happened.

???:
Some things, I have heard. But details, no.

W:
You're just an Ursusian.

???:
These two identities. Do not conflict.

???:
The bloodline. Has not changed. Dark, and deeply rooted.

???:
I care not for it. But run from it? I cannot.

W:
So even if I told you, what do you plan to do?

W:
These things happened a long time ago for me—

???:
Nothing. There is nothing. I can do.

???:
But, it has been so long. Since I saw Theresa.

W:
Ooh...

???:
From your reactions. I see. She is with you. Her mark is here. After all, you are Sarkaz.

???:
Muddied. Blood-soaked.

???:
She is a hero, at least. So respected. A great warrior. A worthy ruler.

???:
My flesh. Loyal to Ursus. From my people, I exiled myself. But I, am still Sarkaz.

???:
I want to know. What happened to her Kazdel.

???:
I just, want to know.

En route to Chernobog

5:22 A.M. \ Clear

Chernobog, Sarkaz mercenary garrison

W:
......

W:
...Need something?

Reunion Soldier:
We hope that your mercenaries can give us an explanation.

Reunion Soldier:
First, your team defected. The people who went after them reported back that you weren't even trying.

Reunion Soldier:
A few hours ago, some enemies managed to infiltrate Chernobog. Again, due to your negligence.

Reunion Soldier:
Combined with the fact that when we first captured Chernobog, someone tipped us off that you let—

W:
Okay, okay, I got it. The client's dissatisfied with our performance. Can you say that with fewer words?

W:
We're simply in a 'cooperative' relationship, and I'm the leader now. If I get on this table and start grovelling, will Talulah be happy?

W:
Or, did having Papa Patriot around give you the illusion... that Reunion is actually good at fighting a war?

W:
Make no mistake about who the people actually capable of bringing you victory are.

Reunion Soldier:
...

W:
If you've figured it out, hurry up and crawl back to that dragon girl. I'll tell her what she wants to know soon enough, so don't rush me.

Reunion Soldier:
There's one other thing.

Reunion Soldier:
Just now, stragglers from an enemy party were detected inside the city. That mercenary, Ines, died after exchanging fire with them.

W:
......

Reunion Soldier:
Reunion also participated in this battle. The enemies were very strong, and we all suffered losses.

Reunion Soldier:
This is all due to your negligence.

W:
...There's no need to get pushy with me.

W:
Seems like something happened to the east of here not long ago.

Reunion Soldier:
Precisely.

W:
So... where's the body?

Reunion Soldier:
Unfortunately, I have bad news.

W:
I'm talking about the enemy's corpses. Ines wouldn't use such flashy, destructive Arts.

Reunion Soldier:
Our casters were also involved in the battle. The entire street was destroyed.

W:
Don't you think you're being a bit too blatant here?

Reunion Soldier:
I don't know what you're talking about.

W:
...So, from your side's point of view, how should this situation be handled?

Reunion Soldier:
...Our main force is focused on the battle that will take place in Lungmen. We have no time to waste here.

Reunion Soldier:
The Leader won't investigate your responsibility in this just yet, so you should handle it yourself.

W:
Hmm... You have a pretty thick Ursus accent.

Reunion Soldier:
...What of it?

W:
You guys...

W:
...Didn't really think that I'd take some random excuse, did you?

Hoederer:
W, stop.

Hoederer:
(Put that wand away and calm down first.)

W:
...

W:
Sorry, got a bit carried away there. You can breathe a sigh of relief first and be grateful that you get to live.

Reunion Soldier:
What's the meaning of this?!

W:
...Don't get me wrong. The death of one Sarkaz won't affect the outcome of the next battle.

W:
And neither will the death of the entire Reunion Movement.

W:
If you don't believe me, you're welcome to try me.

Reunion Soldier:
...I'll make sure our Leader hears about your true attitude.

Reunion Soldier:
There won't be a next time.

Hoederer:
...

W:
You heard 'em.

Hoederer:
Since you let that Rhodes Island squad escape, Reunion has never allowed us to act alone.

W:
If they could put half this much effort into their actual battles, they wouldn't be getting their asses handed to them so badly.

Hoederer:
Despite that, you still deliberately let that traitorous blademaster get away.

W:
...I didn't deliberately let him go. I just didn't want those idiotic Infected to kill a Sarkaz I brought here.

Hoederer:
...The old you would've slaughtered Flamebringer on the spot to get Reunion's attention off of you.

Hoederer:
Regardless of what you wanted.

W:
Eh? Was I the only one who couldn't remember his codename? How embarrassing.

Hoederer:
...

W:
......

Hoederer:
So, is Ines really...

W:
Now's not the time...

W:
She... I'll have someone identify her, identify her c— ...Tch.

W:
Let's talk business first.

Hoederer:
...Three things.

Hoederer:
First, Ines wanted to warn you that something's wrong with Talulah. She must've seen something more specific, but I'm not clear on that.

Hoederer:
All she told me was, Talulah apparently had 'two shadows.' From her reaction, this isn't some common byproduct of Arts interference.

W:
That damn coward... Why wouldn't she ever be straightforward...

Hoederer:
Second, the old man has left. Received an order to go fetch something. Talulah didn't even make any efforts to hide it.

W:
......

Hoederer:
...Finally, a messenger has already set off for Victoria. Shortly, the Regent will know everything that has happened here.

Hoederer:
Theresis knows many things, and he has just as many monsters around him.

Hoederer:
If he is allowed to intervene, this would no longer be a simple question between Reunion and Ursus...

W:
......

Hoederer:
W! Are you listening to me?

W:
...Too noisy. Since it's all good news anyway, let me have some peace and quiet.

W:
You've had your hand on the hilt of your blade... ever since you walked through the door.

W:
You were like that when we first met, as if you were ready to cut me down at any moment.

W:
But the way you stayed calm back there was just like Patriot—

W:
What do you really think about this?

Hoederer:
That's not important.

W:
And none of us are. We all know this, and bad habits die hard.

W:
Ines, she...

W:
I have the right to hear what she said, right? ...In order to respect her sacrifice.

Hoederer:
...You two are both similar. Never considering the consequences of the things you do.

Hoederer:
The Regent will not sit idly and watch them lose control. If you can't give him a suitable answer, Londinium's summons will destroy everything you've painstakingly put together.

Hoederer:
Ironically, I still don't know what you're trying to accomplish, even now.

W:
...Who knows?

Hoederer:
Just, don't think you can handle everything alone, W. You'll come to regret it sooner or later, just like me.

W:
The reason you have the right to ask questions is because you avoided the center of the whirlpool.

Hoederer:
Really? Who's still left on Rhodes Island now?

W:
...Why are you asking that?

Hoederer:
I've seen your interactions with the messenger. You've been investigating Rhodes Island's trail.

Hoederer:
That drug company... I had assumed they only got caught up in that war, but turns out, the truth isn't so simple.

Hoederer:
Especially, Scout...

Hoederer:
...According to your plan, we were in charge of all the other fronts during the battle to hold Chernobog.

W:
Yeah, and you guys did a great job—

Hoederer:
But, someone still found him, the ghost of Babel. You chose to find him yourself, and then you let him go.

Hoederer:
In the past, I would've seen this as a sign of untrustworthiness.

Hoederer:
But by the looks of things, you didn't plan to keep that secret for long anyway.

W:
Ugh, what point is there in hiding that?

W:
If you've ever fought in a battle, you're bound to know some people who have a bit of a reputation.

W:
After all, if those people have been fighting tooth and nail to hang on, there's no getting around it.

Hoederer:
What's your plan now? We shouldn't have had to fight against them in the first place.

Hoederer:
If that Kal'tsit is still in charge of Rhodes Island,  this might be a chance...

W:
No.

W:
What do you think my objective is?

Hoederer:
...I see.

W:
You said you'd help me do this one thing. We agreed on it.

W:
Dishonest mercenaries are worth just as much as dead mercenaries, so I don't mind making some extra arrangements.

Hoederer:
Ines can no longer help you.

Hoederer:
And soon... I'll have to leave too.

W:
Oh, I haven't heard about this before. Where to?

Hoederer:
I'll head back to Victoria with the messenger. It'll be about a three or four-month trip. We'll leave tomorrow morning before sunrise.

W:
...Are you in that much of a hurry to reunite with Ines in death? With your reputation, you plan to head back to Londinium carrying all that sin on your shoulders?

W:
You'd probably be better off fleeing back to Kazdel.

Hoederer:
You killed Garcin and reorganized the mercenaries. Someone has to report this to the Regent.

Hoederer:
If nobody goes to report this, he'll treat us like disowned children and cast us straight into the next warzone. A battlefield within his reach.

Hoederer:
When that time comes, there really will be no place to run.

W:
You're taking this risk to cover for me? Why would you do that?

Hoederer:
Her Majesty, Theresa... She remembered my name. And my family.

Hoederer:
Though Her Majesty is no longer here, there's a part of her left in this piece of shit, no good squad.

W:
How come I've never seen it?

Hoederer:
Mm. No matter how perverse the Sarkaz's personalities and methods may be, judging from the results, they're still fighting for that lofty, unrealistic idea.

W:
...Do you even know what you're talking about?

Hoederer:
We've known each other for a long time, W.

Hoederer:
That's all.

W:
Out of compassion, let me also give you a reminder.

W:
This is your best opportunity to escape Kazdel. Leave from here, past Lungmen and Ursus, to the distant lands beyond. I'm willing to keep one eye closed.

W:
But if you go back, know that you will die.

Hoederer:
Hah... Just earlier, you said you wanted me to help you do your thing.

W:
If your idea of helping me is just committing suicide, then I suggest you hang on to your life instead.

W:
When it's my turn to collect, I'd like some of my debtors to still be alive.

Hoederer:
I wouldn't necessarily be going there to die. Depending on the Regent's mood, there are many possible outcomes.

Hoederer:
Reunion has been manipulated into something far beyond what you can imagine. The Regent may well change his mind.

Hoederer:
...In any case, I no longer have the luxury of running away.

Hoederer:
I've left Kazdel. And I'm about to leave here. What's the worst that could happen? Patriot has already taught me enough.

W:
You've been influenced by him a lot, just from your short time here.

Hoederer:
Just like you were, with Theresa. It's all the same, isn't it?

Hoederer:
Theresis sits on his throne. Even if I am only able to grovel my way up there with my head pressed against the ground, I must reach where he is, and figure out what he is thinking.

Hoederer:
Otherwise, if we continue acting recklessly as we are now, that will truly be committing suicide.

W:
You know, you could also just submit to him.

Hoederer:
I've thought about that before. Just so you know, Garcin was always suspicious of you. He even gave me the order to kill you once.

W:
Oh? Sounds like things would've been a bit more entertaining if you had listened to him.

Hoederer:
Sorry, but I'm not into the same kind of stuff you're into.

Hoederer:
Now, let's decide.

W:
Hm... I won't deny that I'm curious about what Theresis is up to.

W:
Seems like I have no choice though.

Hoederer:
That's right. Even if you rejected my proposal, I don't plan to let you keep running the show.

W:
You're not gonna say that this is for my good, right?

Hoederer:
Of course not. What kind of Sarkaz goes around taking care of others?

W:
...How disappointing, you've just gone right back to your old ways. I thought you were going to keep falling.

W:
So, do you already have a plan?

Hoederer:
Why don't you go ask Ines?

W:
That's a really unfunny joke.

Hoederer:
Then, before I leave, let me tell you another joke.

Hoederer:
Ines once told me that you looked more and more like a lunatic, but your actions got less and less decisive.

W:
Who, me? Do you really believe that?

W:
Have I been using fewer bombs recently?

Hoederer:
Maybe. No matter how good you might be at hiding it, we've worked together for far too many years.

Hoederer:
Who's to say, maybe we trusted you this whole time.

W:
......

W:
...So, which line was the joke?

Reunion Soldier:
...Oh, it's you. Sarkaz mercenary, Hoederer, huh?

Reunion Soldier:
I heard you were leaving. What business do you have with us?

Hoederer:
Before I leave, there's something I'd like to confirm...

Hoederer:
Did any of you personally see Ines fall in battle?

Reunion Soldier:
No.

Reunion Soldier:
As soon as we received the support request, the battle was over.

Reunion Soldier:
The street had been torn apart, and the Originium crystals left by the Catastrophe caused a violent chain reaction.

Reunion Soldier:
We got the situation under control with fairly minimal—

Reunion Soldier:
...What are you doing?

Hoederer:
Ursursian, you're pretty calm for someone who just saw a companion fall in front of your eyes.

Reunion Soldier:
...

Hoederer:
You give off the stench of conspiracy and war. A stench that is all too familiar—

Hoederer:
If Ines was still here, that's definitely what she'd say.

Reunion Soldier:
So that's what this is about. It's all too common for people to vent their anger on the Infected over a fallen comrade.

Reunion Soldier:
I just thought you would've been a little smarter than W.

Hoederer:
...A little smarter, huh?

Hoederer:
Yeah, looking back, I've been a bit overprotective of her. Always have been.

Hoederer:
But not because I was afraid she'd get in trouble. You see, I was more afraid that I'd have nobody to kill.

Hoederer:
After all, I'm also a Sarkaz... the real deal.

Reunion Soldier:
You——!
