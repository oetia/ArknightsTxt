What happened to Babel? Any Sarkaz in contact with Her Majesty Theresa at the time would've asked this question.

W definitely saw the truth, but she said nothing during the long journey.

I didn't ask, and neither did Ines. But, I think she's closer to the truth than I am.

Before I knew it, I found myself trailing behind everyone else.

Hoederer:
...Of course.

Hoederer:
Yes, it'll be fine. I'll keep contact with the other teams.

Hoederer:
...By your command.

Hoederer:
Phew...

Hoederer:
Guys, it looks like we'll be stationed here for a while.

Ines:
What happened?

Hoederer:
The scouts spotted a Catastrophe brewing, with no Catastrophe Messengers nearby. We should stay as far away as possible, just in case.

Hoederer:
We can't risk it, no matter what.

Ines:
...A Catastrophe, huh?

Hoederer:
It's rare to see one raging in the wilderness.

Hoederer:
But we have plenty of experience dealing with Originium in Kazdel, so no need to panic.

Hoederer:
...Where's W?

Ines:
She's with her team.

Ines:
...Need her for something?

Hoederer:
I'm... not sure. She's changed a lot.

Ines:
Do you think her personality would change that much just because Theresa is gone?

Hoederer:
She's too calm. It's unlike her.

Hoederer:
But when we found her on the battlefield earlier, she still had that cynical, sarcastic expression.

Ines:
If anything, she's only gotten worse.

Ines:
That's odd. I never thought you'd be perceptive enough to pick up on these subtle warning signs.

Hoederer:
...Save the jabs. If W's being quiet, that warning sign's far from 'subtle.'

Ines:
W, she... Oh—

Ines:
Look, the clouds are converging on the other side of the mountain, and the air pressure has changed drastically... Is that a Catastrophe cloud?

Hoederer:
...It might not be safe to station here given the size of that thing. Notify all our forces to retreat 50 kilometers along our original route.

Hoederer:
Find W, and make it quick.

Ines:
...I don't take orders from you.

Ines:
*Sigh*...

Ines:
You know, the feeling W gives off now... is just like that thing.

W:
Ahah...

Ines:
W! What are you doing—!

Ines:
The wind— is so strong here!

W:
I'm enjoying the Catastrophe, what else?!

Ines:
Are you insane—

W:
What'd you say? I— can't— hear— you—

Ines:
Tch... I forgot you were always a lunatic.

Ines:
Don't get the Sarkaz on your team killed with you!

W:
I already told them to evacuate with Hoederer. I'm not stupid— Hah!

Ines:
W! I'm telling you, be careful! Damn it!

W:
You're the one who should stay back. You're not gonna make it if you fall down there—

Ines:
And you think you will? If you don't want to die, get your ass back here—!

Hoederer:
...What the hell are you two doing?

Ines:
Ask her.

W:
She insists on clinging to me.

Hoederer:
...*Sigh*.

Hoederer:
Fortunately, we didn't lose anyone from W's team. Otherwise, we'd get court-martialed long before we get to join Reuinon.

Ines:
...

Hoederer:
Let's all head back and rest first, then wait for the news.

W:
What's wrong with fighting during a Catastrophe? Are you afraid of the storm? Or of Oripathy?

Ines:
I'd just rather not die an early death.

W:
Let's get ourselves ready.

W:
It'll be a real special experience.

Hoederer:
Ines.

Ines:
What? I'm not upset. It's not like we're a couple of ornery kids you have to break apart.

Ines:
I can say... that W did a good job taking care of her team.

Hoederer:
Rare to hear you say that.

Ines:
Say what? ...I have no idea if she's just a lunatic, or if she's... Goddamnit.

Ines:
She's no damn storm cloud. She is the Catastrophe.

Hoederer:
(*Swears*...)

W:
Ahahaha~!

Sarkaz Warrior:
...You're in a good mood.

W:
Of course.

W:
There's some news, but you don't get to hear it until we're out of this trash heap of a country.

Sarkaz Warrior:
That can't be why you set our rendezvous point right under a Catastrophe, right...? Are you trying to get me killed?

W:
Hey, don't put it that way.

W:
Do you know what the biggest perk of being a lunatic is?

Sarkaz Warrior:
I'm not sure I want to know. But, I already have a pretty good idea just from following you, boss.

W:
That's right.

W:
It's this. The crazier shit you do, the less others question you.

Sarkaz Warrior:
*Sigh*...

W:
The 'Rhodes Island' already left Kazdel, right?

Sarkaz Warrior:
To be specific, we don't have any reports of a landship that big getting taken in by His Ma... by Theresis's.

W:
Good enough.

W:
Mm, so we do have a lead after all.

We have more and more fresh faces on the team, but I feel better, knowing that I left Kazdel.

Among those traveling with me are both friends and enemies, but it's always been volatile like that.

Mercenaries don't care too much about the past because for our kind, life and death are easy come, easy go.

Maybe because the war ended too quickly, we immediately plunged first into the next battle without ever tasting a moment of peace.

...This kind of hope could just be another poison. Since the beginning, we've always needed war and conflict to ease this balance.

W is the best example of this. She's long become drunk on it.

Talulah:
...Ah.

Talulah:
Welcome.

Talulah:
Warriors from afar.

War has never been something that can be avoided.

I've always known that, of course. But at that moment, I truly realized it.

War has permeated every corner of this world. It always has, ever since the first sentient thing was born.

And, we will become mired in it again.
