W:
You're still pushing forward?

W:
Without treatment, you're definitely getting infected.

Unyielding Child:
Why would I believe a devil?

W:
A devil, huh?

W:
So many devils around me all the time, sometimes I forget we even have that word.

Unyielding Child:
Gah, stop following us!

W:
I've been keeping my distance.

Unyielding Child:
And stop acting nice! If you're gonna kill us, just do it already!

Waifish Child:
Ru-Rublev, you really shouldn't provoke her...

Unyielding Child:
Okay. We're going then.

Unyielding Child:
Ignore her.

Waifish Child:
S-sorry!

Unyielding Child:
I don't care if I get infected! We don't need a devil's help!

Waifish Child:
...Um.

W:
Uh huh...

W:
There's an abandoned hospital around here. Chernobog District Hospital.

W:
Wanna know where it is?

Unyielding Child:
......

Waifish Child:
Rublev...?

Unyielding Child:
Don't listen to her. She's trying to trick us.

Unyielding Child:
Let's ditch her... quick.

Unyielding Child:
See that alley over there? You take that corner and I think we can get there in less than a minute!

Waifish Child:
Okay.

Unyielding Child:
——Run!

W:
They're fast.

Unyielding Child:
H-How did she catch up to us so quick?! Agh!

Waifish Child:
Rublev... your leg! Th-the blood is turning black...

Unyielding Child:
Ugh, I could've outran her if I didn't have to save you!

Waifish Child:
Sorry...

Unyielding Child:
Whatever! Just be quiet.

Unyielding Child:
Don't let her find us.

W:
......

W:
Head down that street, turn left, and you'll come to a ruined plaza.

W:
On the west side, that big white building, that's the hospital.

W:
The abandoned hospital.

Waifish Child:
...I think... she knows we're here...

Unyielding Child:
Because you don't listen to me——fine.

Unyielding Child:
Hey, devil.

Unyielding Child:
Why did you tell us that?

W:
Felt like it.

W:
How do you two know each other?

Waifish Child:
......

Unyielding Child:
I found him while I was out looking for food.

Waifish Child:
Rublev saved me...

W:
And that's why you do what he says?

Waifish Child:
......

W:
No skin off my back. Whatever you want. But now it's time for you to help out your savior here.

Unyielding Child:
What are you gonna make him do?

Waifish Child:
Rublev...

W:
Nothing. I told you, there's a hospital right over there.

W:
I mean, Reunion isn't dumb, so they wouldn't waste perfectly good medical supplies... So if you wanna save your little pal Rublev, you're gonna have to steal.

W:
It's a bunch of Infected thugs over there. Thugs who murdered your family and friends.

W:
And that's the only place they'll have the drugs that can stop the onset of Oripathy.

W:
So go steal, rob, loot, it's all good.

W:
Just don't expect anybody to help you.

Unyielding Child:
No! Don't listen to her!

Waifish Child:
B-But...

W:
No?

W:
He knows your name, Rublev. Do you know his?

Unyielding Child:
What does that have to do with anything?!

Unyielding Child:
Don't go! You can't do it! There's too many——

Waifish Child:
I——

Waifish Child:
I... I want to try...

Waifish Child:
Rublev isn't the only one who got hurt in the Catastrophe...

Waifish Child:
There's so much pain... I...

Unyielding Child:
Why aren't you listening to me?!

Waifish Child:
I...

W:
He doesn't have to listen to you.

W:
It's good that you wanna save those people.

W:
Just keep that hospital in mind. They keep the supplies down in an underground storeroom.

W:
You could get in through the vents in the parking garage, or through the sewers, as long as there's not too much toxic waste down there.

W:
You could die there though.

Waifish Child:
......

Unyielding Child:
C'mon, your legs are shaking! You can't do it! We were dumb to even listen to a devil in the first place!

Unyielding Child:
Let's get out of here!

Waifish Child:
I...

Waifish Child:
Eeep——

Unyielding Child:
Wh-What was that?

W:
Some things went down in Lungmen... wiped some stuff out here too.

W:
Why wouldn't folks have their eye on a perfectly good battlefield hospital here in Chernobog?

W:
Why do you think... a devil like me would know that hospital so well?

Unyielding Child:
Because you——Umm, ah——

Waifish Child:
I... I...

W:
That must hurt like a bastard. I'm starting to think he's probably beyond help at this point.

W:
If you don't act soon..

W:
You might just die right here.

Waifish Child:
Ah...

Unyielding Child:
You, ugh, what are you doing? Stay away from me!

W:
To go?

W:
Or not to go?

W:
Oh... but what if it's already too late, even if you did go? There's a riot going on, it might be too hard to sneak in and grab the goods——

Waifish Child:
I-I'm going.

W:
——Yeah... you're dead.

Unyielding Child:
Why are you still listening to her? I'm the one who saved you!

Waifish Child:
But I... want to try...

Unyielding Child:
There's no way you can do it! We'll go to a drugstore, we'll find some food, that'll be enough!!

Waifish Child:
——

Waifish Child:
I'm sorry!

Unyielding Child:
Hey... wait!

W:
If you knew his name, maybe you could call out and stop him? Kinda sad.

Unyielding Child:
You... you tricked him! You devil!

W:
Tricked?

W:
I haven't told a single lie.

W:
But hey, whether or not you believe me, that's your call.

W:
Whether or not you believe him, that's your call too.

Unyielding Child:
...I, I'm gonna go find him, nnggh...

W:
Why?

Unyielding Child:
H-He can't do anything without me...

W:
You're scared he's gonna run away.

W:
You're thinking... why did he leave you alone with me? With a devil?

Unyielding Child:
Am not!

Unyielding Child:
Suka! A monster like you——

W:
Shut up.

W:
Wait here for him. Don't move.

W:
Or I'll kill you.

Unyielding Child:
Nnng——

W:
Who do you think I am?

W:
I'm a killer.

W:
I'm the killer who destroyed this city, hurt your parents and friends.

W:
Ah... haha. That's right.

W:
I forgot you had that blade. Look, it's got a Sarkaz charm on the hilt, and it's still bloody.

W:
Whose blood do you think it is?

Unyielding Child:
*Whimper*... I, I don't know... you made him...

W:
Go ahead and cry. Kids can cry.

W:
It's all up to you... whether you live or die.

Unyielding Child:
He can't do it...

W:
You sure?

Unyielding Child:
If I hadn't dug him out of those ruins, he'd already be dead...

Unyielding Child:
He needs me.

W:
......

W:
Nope... nobody needs anyone.

W:
Nobody does.

Unyielding Child:
......

W:
This ruined city got quiet again.

W:
There's a lot less resistance, after that slaughter. That's a good thing. Less effort. Less death.

W:
But it's quiet over at the hospital too. Nothing moving over there, as far as I can tell.

Unyielding Child:
......

Unyielding Child:
He... he didn't...

W:
Huh?

Unyielding Child:
Maybe... he didn't actually go...

Unyielding Child:
It's been... Nng... so long...

W:
He ran away.

Unyielding Child:
......

W:
But you saved him. Wouldn't he want to save you too?

Unyielding Child:
...I...

W:
Or maybe you're strong enough to save him, but he couldn't save you?

Unyielding Child:
He... He can't do anything right!

Unyielding Child:
Like when we went looking for food! He couldn't even tell there was someone else in the store!

Unyielding Child:
It's all his fault my leg got——!

W:
......

Unyielding Child:
......

W:
Where are you going?

Unyielding Child:
I... I'm going home alone...

W:
I already told you, you leave and you die.

Unyielding Child:
But he already ran off!

W:
Hah.

W:
I can see it in your eyes. You hate him.

Unyielding Child:
N-No I don't!

Unyielding Child:
But if... if he did go... it's been so long... he must be...

W:
——Shut up.

W:
You won't know anything until he comes back.

W:
You can sit here thinking he's coming back, or that he's not.

W:
But if you're thinking that he's not, if you're doubting him, hating him, that's on you.

W:
But you went right to thinking he blew it and ran off. Why?

W:
Because you saved him? Because you're the strong one?

Unyielding Child:
...*whimper*.

Unyielding Child:
Waaahhh——

W:
You're still strong enough to cry.

W:
Settle down. Give it a minute and you'll be in too much pain to cry.

W:
You're young, you're not Sarkaz. So if can't take it anymore, you can tell me.

W:
I'll end it for you.

W:
......

Unyielding Child:
Wah... aahhh... waahh...

W:
You're losing consciousness.

W:
Ah well... guess he won't make it in time.

Unyielding Child:
No... I can still...

Unyielding Child:
I'll wait... for him...

W:
......

W:
You've got faith in him again. That's because you're scared to die.

W:
Kids are a good judge of character. You won't get this kind of stuff out of me.

Unyielding Child:
....Hnng...

W:
But he's definitely taking way too long.

W:
Got maybe ten minutes.

W:
Don't worry. If it comes down to it, I'm not gonna let a kid die in pain.

Unyielding Child:
......

W:
...can't even whimper anymore, huh?

W:
What are you thinking?

W:
Do you hate me? Or him?

W:
Or maybe you hate yourself for sticking your nose where it didn't belong, saving that kid, and getting yourself hurt?

Unyielding Child:
...I don't...

W:
You sure?

W:
So you can still talk. Guess I misjudged you.

Unyielding Child:
......

W:
Look, Rublev.

W:
What do you think it is that decides what a person's gonna do?

W:
Is it a nature or nurture thing? Where they're born, how they're born? What kind of baggage they're weighed down with?

W:
Nah, none of that matters.

W:
It's the whole, complete, sum total of the influences on his life, all those changing thoughts and beliefs.

W:
And just how strong he believes in those beliefs.

W:
You saved that kid, but you didn't really trust him completely. You looked down on him, because you saw yourself as his messiah.

W:
But him? He's easy. You saved him, he wants to save you.

W:
When it comes to this stuff, he's stronger than you are.

W:
Keep the blade. It's a Sarkaz blade, so I'm allowed to stand in for its owner and give it to you.

W:
Wave it around, learn to swing it, sell it for cash. Whatever. It's yours.

W:
That's the deal.

Unyielding Child:
What... are you talking about...?

Waifish Child:
R-Rublev! Are you okay?!

Waifish Child:
Look!

Waifish Child:
I did it! I stole an entire box of medical supplies! Painkillers! Bandages!

Waifish Child:
Rublev...

Unyielding Child:
Keep it... down. I'm not dead yet...

Waifish Child:
O-Okay. Let me bandage your wound...!

Waifish Child:
How do you use the bandage...? Is- is this the Oripathy medicine? I-I'll open it...

Unyielding Child:
Aren't... your parents doctors?

Waifish Child:
Oh... they never taught me anything. But I'll try...

Unyielding Child:
...You got hurt?

Waifish Child:
I'm fine. Just a scratch... Somebody hit me with a piece of metal...

Unyielding Child:
Idiot...!

Waifish Child:
...Hehe...

Unyielding Child:
Where's... the Sarkaz?

Waifish Child:
Oh... I didn't see her when I came back... Did she stay with you?

Unyielding Child:
......

Waifish Child:
Rublev?

Unyielding Child:
......

Unyielding Child:
...Say, um... What's... your name?

Waifish Child:
Oh? Err... Andrey.

Unyielding Child:
Your whole name...?

Waifish Child:
Andrey Fyodorovich Ostrovsky... heh.

Unyielding Child:
What are you laughing at?

Waifish Child:
You finally asked, Rublev.

Unyielding Child:
...Sorry.

Waifish Child:
N-No, you don't have to apologize...

Waifish Child:
All right. How do you feel?

Unyielding Child:
Better...?

Waifish Child:
Great!

Waifish Child:
Let's go back home. I'll help you up.

Waifish Child:
The grown-ups will be very happy about this box!

I smiled, watching those kids.

If they were going to survive, they had to kill that seed of doubt.

You only suffer if you survive.

Like a moth to a flame, a worm in a hole.

You have to chase something, even at a cost.

W:
Isn't that right...

W:
...Talulah?
