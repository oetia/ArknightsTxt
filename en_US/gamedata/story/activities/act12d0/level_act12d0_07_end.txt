Ceobe:
I can't believe Reunion here is so tough. Hmph, I won't lose to you!

Gavial:
Tch, this silly girl.

Gavial:
Wake up!

Ceobe:
Hm? Where am I?

Ceobe:
Oh, it's Gavial! Everyone else too!

Ceobe:
Ehehe. Good morning, Doctor.

Ceobe:
Um, Doctor looks a little scary right now. Did I do something wrong?

Ceobe:
Doctor, please don't be mad...

Ceobe:
Hnng... Doctor, that hurt.

Ceobe:
Why did you bop me on the head...?

Gavial:
Looks like she's back to her senses, at least.

Gavial:
Kay, do you remember how you got here?

Ceobe:
Umm... I forgot!

Gavial:
Alright.

Gavial:
Come lie down, I'll check and see if there's anything wrong with you. Don't run off again.

Ceobe:
Okay~ Ehh, where are we?

Gavial:
We're... Hm, it's a long story. Just lie down already!

Ceobe:
Oohâ€”

Eunectes:
Gavial, what the hell are you doing?

Gavial:
Ugh, that's a long story too. Just let me work.

Eunectes:
......

Ten minutes later...

Gavial:
Alright, everything looks okay. Go wait with the Doctor and don't wander off. If you do it again, it's no more honey biscuits for you.

Ceobe:
Okay! Honey biscuits!

Eunectes:
Are you done?

Gavial:
I'm done.

Eunectes:
So now can you tell me what the hell you're doing, Gavial?

Gavial:
*Sigh*, I said it's a long story. Short version is I'm here to look for you.

Eunectes:
You're not getting the engine back.

Gavial:
That too. But there's another reason I'm looking for you.

Eunectes:
Another reason?

Gavial:
Do you have your people mining ore?

Eunectes:
Yes.

Gavial:
...Tch.

Eunectes:
Gavial, I never took you for the sore loser type.

Eunectes:
Are you that broken up about being beaten by the Big, Ugly Thing?

Gavial:
No, your Big Ugly Whatever is great. I'm totally fine with that.

Gavial:
But if you're putting your people at risk of Oripathy infection for the sake of some ore, then as a doctor I have no choice but to stop you.

Eunectes:
Huh? Oripathy? Oh, you're talking about Stone Disease.

Eunectes:
I'm not putting anyone at risk.

Gavial:
Huh?

Eunectes:
I told them many times to stay away from the depths of the mine.

Gavial:
But your people are getting infected!

Eunectes:
There's always someone who doesn't listen. I can't control them all. Isn't that right, Yogi?

Yogi:
Yes, my brother wanted to dig out more ore for the Great Chief, so he went deeper into the mine.

Gavial:
Huh? Why didn't you say so earlier?!

Yogi:
You didn't ask.

Gavial:
That's pretty important...!

Gavial:
Agh, fine.

Gavial:
Doctor, did I really not ask?!

Gavial:
Agh, Doctor, take my side here!

Eunectes:
Also...

Gavial:
Hey, why are you taking your clothes off?

Gavial:
Huh? Your body...

Eunectes:
I've been running around the mine ever since I was a kid. It's only natural I would get the Stone Disease.

Eunectes:
I dare say no one knows better than me where the diseased rocks are.

Gavial:
......

Gavial:
All right then.

Gavial:
My mistake. Sorry for accusing you, Zumama.

Eunectes:
It's fine.

Utage:
Eh, that's all it took?! We're all good now?!

Utage:
Isn't everybody supposed to stubbornly stick to their guns until we all end up in one big honkin' battle?

Croissant:
Ya shouldn't hope fer stuff like that!

Gavial:
Then let's talk about the other thing.

Gavial:
You have our engine, don't you?

Eunectes:
Yes.

Gavial:
Can you return that to us? We can't leave without it.

Eunectes:
No.

Eunectes:
If you want to leave, I can have someone escort you.

Gavial:
No good. Kal'tsit will get mad.

Gavial:
You won't hand it over no matter what?

Eunectes:
No matter what.

Utage:
Oh, looks like we're gonna fight after all.

Gavial:
Looks like it.

Eunectes:
That was the plan from the very beginning.

Gavial:
Oh, are we fighting that? Fun!

High Priest:
Hello, nice to meet you!

Eunectes:
...High Priest, why did you bring the Big Ugly out?

High Priest:
Huh? Aren't we going to fight Gavial? Do we not need it? If not, I'll drive it back. I still want to test the engine.

Eunectes:
...We need it, but not now. I still have something to say.

High Priest:
Oh, alright. You have your talk first then. Call me when you want to fight!

Eunectes:
Sure.

Gavial:
Hey, what was that about an engine?

Eunectes:
That's right, your engine is powering the Big Ugly right now. If you want it, you'll have to fight for it.

Gavial:
Hehe. Deal!

Eunectes:
Come with me. We'll see who comes out on top.
