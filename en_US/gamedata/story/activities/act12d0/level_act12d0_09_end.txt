Gavial:
It's over, Tomimi.

Tomimi:
...N-No it's not!

Tomimi:
Nurul, Peta!

Dylan:
Doctor!

Lancet-2:
Doctor!

Tomimi:
If you don't want your friends getting hurt...

Gavial:
Don't make me angry, Tomimi!

Tomimi:
...I won't stop until you promise you'll stay, Gavial!

Dylan:
Help me, Doctor!

Lancet-2:
Doctor, I'm scared... Waaahhh...

Dylan:
Doctor, please. The girl's pouring her heart out here, it wouldn't kill you to work with her.

Lancet-2:
The people here are simple. Honestly, it hurts my non-existent robot heart to cheat them so.

Dylan:
Hey now, Doctor, don't look at me like that.

Dylan:
Relax, I'm a Rhodes Island Operator too. Of course I can handle something like this.

Lancet-2:
Doctor!

Lancet-2:
Doctor!

Dylan:
Wow, you two are really selling it.

Tomimi:
What?

Archosauria:
When did you get free?!

Dylan:
Hah. Sorry, somebody needs to learn to tie a knot.

Gavial:
Did you know Tomimi was going to do this, Doctor?

Tomimi:
B-B-But how did you know?

Gavial:
Oh? Hesitated?

Tomimi:
......

Dylan:
Oh, I gave it to Lancet-2.

Lancet-2:
Wahhh... That was just for you, Doctor. I don't normally let people put things inside me so easily.

Eunectes:
......

Gavial:
It's... a rocket launcher?

Dylan:
Yep. Found it with Tomimi's tribe.

Gavial:
So that means...

Dylan:
You got it. The one who shot us down was this little runt right here.

Gavial:
Tomimi.

Tomimi:
Ohhhhh, I'm sorry, Gavial.

Gavial:
Come here.

Tomimi:
(Whimper)

Gavial:
You're going over my knee.

Tomimi:
Gavial, please don't spank me, I know what I did was bad...

Gavial:
Them's the breaks.

Gavial:
Naughty little whelps get tail spankings!

Tomimi:
(Whimper)

Ceobe:
Tail spanking, huh? Looks ouchie...

Gavial:
Are you going to do it again?

Tomimi:
I won't do it agaaain! Waaahhh...!

Gavial:
Good.

Gavial:
Anyway, I think we're pretty much okay now, Doctor.

Gavial:
Haha, well, it's definitely been a lot.

Gavial:
Hey, Doctor, you're not falling asleep on your feet there, are you?

Gavial:
I wouldn't want to hurt little Tomimi, after all. Phew, I'm a little tired myself.

Lancet-2:
This big guy... does look a little ugly at first, but the angular, rugged design, this cluttered but effective wiring, it has a special beauty to it when you look close.

Lancet-2:
Real marriage material, I think.

Gavial:
Oh, Lancet-2, go see if we can still salvage the engine.

Lancet-2:
What? Are you telling me the engine's inside this big guy? !

Gavial:
Sure is. And we blew it up.

Lancet-2:
Oh, poor engine. Poor big guy.

Lancet-2:
Mr. Dylan, can you do me a favor?

Dylan:
Alright.

Eunectes:
......

Gavial:
Hey, Zumama, why are you standing there drooling like that?

Eunectes:
Gavial!

Gavial:
Huh? What's up?

Eunectes:
That... that...

Gavial:
What what?

Eunectes:
That... that moving, talking machine is incredible!

Gavial:
Oh, you mean Lancet-2? She's a friend of ours.

Eunectes:
C-Can I talk to her?

Gavial:
Knock yourself out.

Eunectes:
Erm... Hello.

Lancet-2:
Hi?

Eunectes:
Are you... a machine?

Lancet-2:
My product designation is Raythean Exister-S62 Model six-wheeled operation platform. I belong to Rhodes Island, codename Lancet-2.

Eunectes:
Wow!

Lancet-2:
Yes. I do have a certain level of intelligence. As long as your questions aren't too hard, I should be able to answer them.

Lancet-2:
Speaking of which, I am a medical operation platform, so my knowledge base is focused on medicine. Do keep that in mind.

Eunectes:
^%&$*#(#......! ! !

Lancet-2:
Is something wrong?

Eunectes:
Can I hug you?

Lancet-2:
What?

Gavial:
What is she doing? Did a screw come loose?

High Priest:
Isn't it obvious? She's in awe of that machine.

Gavial:
Oh?

High Priest:
Shocked as she was when she first saw a moving city, a machine that moves and talks on its own is even more striking!

High Priest:
And forget her, I'm just as excited!

High Priest:
Oh, my beautiful young lady, might I have the honor of taking you on a date?

High Priest:
I know the most gorgeous spot in the rainforest. I'll take you there for a lovely afternoon!

Lancet-2:
Oh, y-you're asking me out? !

Lancet-2:
I don't know what to do here. I'm flattered... Doctor, should I accept?

Eunectes:
Don't butt in, High Priest, or you can't blame me for what happens to our friendship after all these years.

Blaze:
Honestly, I'm with the Doctor here.

Blaze:
Kinda wanna laugh.

Lancet-2:
Oh, Doctor, to hear you suddenly come out and say that... My heart isn't ready...

Eunectes:
......

Eunectes:
So Gavial, your people you're with now can create this type of machine?

Gavial:
Huh? Err, I'm pretty sure Closure can, yeah.

Eunectes:
Okay. I've made a decision.

Eunectes:
Does this Rhodes Island place need more hands? I want to join.

Gavial:
Oh?

Eunectes:
I want to go with you, to learn about mechanical technology.

Gavial:
Huh?

Eunectes:
I've thought about leaving to go study in the outside world before, but I never seriously considered it because of the tribe. I think this is a great opportunity.

Tomimi:
Th-Then I'm going too!

Gavial:
What?!

Tomimi:
If this is how it's going to be, then it's time for plan B... I'm going with Gavial!

Tomimi:
Gavial, I fight really hard. I can definitely help you, Gavial!

Gavial:
Err, Doctor, what should I do here?

Gavial:
Yeah. Might as well give them the operator tests.

Gavial:
C'mon, Doctor, be nice.

Gavial:
Doooctooor!

Gavial:
Whatever. At least stick with the Doctor and try to learn something.

Tomimi:
Right!

Blaze:
Hey, Gavial, do me a favor and tell me what this little squirt is saying.

Flint:
......

Gavial:
Huh? Kemar?

Flint:
I have to go with her.

Gavial:
She says she's going with you.

Blaze:
Oh. Cool. She packs a punch. I bet she'll make a fine operator.

Gavial:
She said okay.

Flint:
Good.

Gavial:
Hm? Wait a second. So Zumama's going, Tomimi's going, and Kemar's going, what about the tribes?

Gavial:
Ahahaha, I was seeing red back then! Couldn't think at all.

Eunectes:
You're right, though... I can't just abandon my tribe.

High Priest:
Oh, I think you've got nothing to worry about in that department.

Archosauria A:
It's no Gavial, but the Big Ugly is still pretty strong.

Archosauria B:
That's for sure. I want to make one too.

Archosauria C:
With the Temple destroyed, let's build machines instead. Whoever makes the most awesome one gets to be Great Chief?

Archosauria D:
Hey, no! Fighting is way better!

Archosauria C:
Oh, good point. I don't want to give up fighting. What should we do?

Archosauria A:
All right, morons. Why not just fight and also build machines?!

Group of Archosauria:
Yeah!

High Priest:
See? Nothing to worry about at all.

High Priest:
From what I've seen, the common folk are usually quick to adapt, even as the leaders hem and haw about the future.

High Priest:
What if I told you the first Great Chief was actually a Tiacauh Brave who gave himself the title, prior to whom there was no custom to choose a Great Chief at all?

Eunectes:
...High Priest, why did you never tell me that before?

High Priest:
Oh, I never thought it was important. Is it? My point is that people are resilient, they'll go on living even if one of their traditions disappears.

High Priest:
I've always thought of traditions as rituals that bring people together.

High Priest:
But when that tradition carries on for a few decades, they start to think it's inviolable, it's unbreakable, it has to go on forever.

High Priest:
But that's nonsense!

High Priest:
So you tell me you want to blow up the Temple and I'm all in, both hands, both feet, and my tail too!

High Priest:
Oh, no, if my hands and feet are in, my tail has to stay out... right? What if I'm laying down?  Let's see!

Eunectes:
...I get it.

Gavial:
Just how old are you?

High Priest:
How old? I forget.

High Priest:
And honestly, these methods you have for keeping track of time mean nothing to me! Whether or not I happen to have forgotten when I was born!

Gavial:
O...kay. But we still need someone to be the Great Chief.

Inam:
Hey, I heard Gavial and Zumama were fighting again. Is it already over?

Gavial:
Hmm...

Inam:
Why are you looking at me like that, Gavial?

Gavial:
Say, Inam, are you interested in being Great Chief at all?

Inam:
What?

Kal'tsit:
So after going through all that, you got the engine back, performed your emergency repairs, and got on the road back home?

Blaze:
Y-Yeah!

Kal'tsit:
Doctor, I do believe I told you what a precious piece of equipment that aircraft was before you left.

Kal'tsit:
Seeing as the aircraft is still in reparable condition, I won't be too hard on you. But the maintenance costs are coming out of your pay, and Blaze's.

Blaze:
Aww, and mine...?

Kal'tsit:
An elite operator takes elite responsibility.

Blaze:
Agh, fine.

Kal'tsit:
As for the three individuals you brought back, since you seem to think they have what it takes to be operators, I'll leave them to the Doctor.

Kal'tsit:
Gavial, were you satisfied with your trip back home?

Gavial:
Huh? Sure. But even I didn't think it'd go down like that. It was fun.

Kal'tsit:
Honestly, I had a contingency plan in case the Doctor didn't bring you back.

Gavial:
Why?

Kal'tsit:
Because I figured there was a possibility you'd want to stay there.

Gavial:
Huh? Kal'tsit, I thought you knew me better than that.

Kal'tsit:
You've never really adapted to life outside your tribe. Every day, you come into conflict with the world, in your own ferocious way.

Kal'tsit:
I'll put it this way: if someday you asked for a leave of absence, or if you just left, I wouldn't be surprised.

Gavial:
Hey, Doctor, maybe I'm not getting this right. Is Kal'tsit saying she cares about me?

Kal'tsit:
If there's nothing else, Dr. {@nickname}, you can go.

Gavial:
Tch, yeah, this is one of those times the Doctor likes to play dead.

Gavial:
Then I'm gonna go ahead and say you care about me.

Gavial:
That's our Kal'tsit, even confusing the Doctor.

Gavial:
Kal'tsit, I'm not going anywhere.

Gavial:
I had a reason to leave my tribe. I really did want to practice medicine.

Gavial:
Now that's not to say I really thought I could become a doctor, but I'm very happy I made that decision.

Gavial:
From a modern medical standpoint, we pretty much have no doctors back home. If you get sick, you just let it run its course. Maybe try a few traditional remedies.

Gavial:
If I never left, I wouldn't know what the world is really like.

Gavial:
I wouldn't know how many diseases are preventable or curable, I wouldn't know how people look down on Oripathy. I wouldn't know that saving lives makes me as happy as taking them.

Gavial:
The world is definitely complicated, and I don't always know what motivates people, or why they fight.

Gavial:
But I'm a doctor now. And my dream is to treat Oripathy.

Gavial:
Is there a better place in this wide world for me to study and practice medicine?

Kal'tsit:
I'm afraid not.

Gavial:
Well how about that. And by the way, you all work a lot harder than I do. What's with you here worrying about me?

Gavial:
Honestly, I think I should be worrying about you, Kal'tsit.

Gavial:
You didn't pick up my slack while I was away now, did you?

Kal'tsit:
No.

Gavial:
Good. I'm gonna give Zumama an Oripathy checkup. You have a nice chat now.

Blaze:
Oh, I'll see what Kemar's up to. Err, I guess I'm calling her Flint now. I'm worried she'll get into a fight, with the language barrier and all...

Gavial:
Doctor, Tomimi should be in her general studies class now. You check on her when you're done.

Kal'tsit:
Gavial.

Gavial:
Hm?

Kal'tsit:
Welcome back.

Gavial:
Haha.

Blaze:
Hey! What about me? !

Kal'tsit:
You had another mission ready to go last week. You're technically very late.

Blaze:
Oh...

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
In your eyes, you just went on a nonsensical journey.

Kal'tsit:
But, just like our Gavial, it was a showcase of the lively and diverse world we inhabit.

Kal'tsit:
We lose so much to the endless march of time. That which was once a fact of life in the past is now precious to us.

Kal'tsit:
We search for the light that slips through the breaks in the crowd and begin to see that as the norm.

Kal'tsit:
I hope you and your fellow operators learned a lesson from this trip: some things are not too far out of reach.

Closure:
Kal'tsit, meeting time!

Kal'tsit:
I know.

Kal'tsit:
Now then, Dr. {@nickname}, you have a lot of work waiting for you.

Kal'tsit:
I hope you got enough rest on your vacation.
