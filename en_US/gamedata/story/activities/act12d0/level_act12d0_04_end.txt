Archosauria Punk A:
Gah...

Archosauria Punk B:
S-She's strong...

Uda:
You're not half bad, I'll give you that!

Aruna:
Don't get cocky, Eunectes!

Aruna:
All of you, on me!

Eunectes:
......

Tomimi:
Mm, I knew it! Zumama's so tough!

Tomimi:
She may be fighting alone, but just like Gavial, your everyday Archosauria goonies are no match for her.

Tomimi:
But...

Tomimi:
Yep, Zumama and Gavial have always been the strongest around here.

Tomimi:
But as far as I know, Zumama has never managed to beat Gavial!

Tomimi:
Doctor. I bet you don't see people this strong on the outside!

Tomimi:
But Gavial's even stronger than her!

Tomimi:
Yeah, I agree. Zumama is cool.

Tomimi:
But Gavial's way cooler!

Tomimi:
Right, Gavial?

Tomimi:
Huh? Where's Gavial?

Archosauria A:
Hey, look! Over there!

Archosauria B:
I saw her on my way here! Isn't that—

Archosauria C:
She really is back!

Eunectes:
You—

Everyone:
Gavial!

Tomimi:
Wahhhh!! Gavial rushed onto the platform!

Gavial:
It's been a while, Zumama!

Gavial:
Or should I call you the leader of the Eunectes now?

Eunectes:
You came back, Gavial.

Gavial:
That's right, Tomimi asked me to come back.

Gavial:
Hm? Hold up. You know Sargonian?

Eunectes:
...Since you're speaking Sargonian too, I guess this really is what they speak on the outside.

Eunectes:
I've been studying it for a long time.

Eunectes:
...I thought you weren't ever going to come back.

Gavial:
Oh, I'll come back. Not right now, but someday. This is my home, after all.

Eunectes:
Are you trying to become the Great Chief?

Gavial:
Nope, I need you for something else, and I was gonna wait till you were done.

Gavial:
I didn't expect to see you get this badass, though. How am I supposed to hold myself back from fighting you?

Eunectes:
Are you really a doctor now?

Gavial:
Sure am.

Gavial:
Hehe, I'm a pretty famous doctor out there!

Eunectes:
That's amazing.

Gavial:
What about you? You didn't show up last time because you were tinkering with something, right? You done with that yet?

Eunectes:
...Yeah.

Eunectes:
You'll get to see it very soon.

Tomimi:
Ugh... didn't Gavial say she wasn't going to fight her...?

Tomimi:
Hm? N-Not at all! I-It's just...

Tomimi:
Even the Doctor's taken with her...

Tomimi:
Ughh... I mean, she does look super cool, but...

Tomimi:
Oh... it's true.

Eunectes:
You're as strong as I remember.

Gavial:
Heh, you ain't half bad either!

Eunectes:
But you rely on your fists too much.

Gavial:
Oh?

Eunectes:
You can do all sorts of things with your fists, so you don't ever think of using anything else.

Eunectes:
That's what's holding you back, and it's what's holding all of us back.

Gavial:
What are you talking about?

Eunectes:
What I'm trying to say is it's time for change.

Just then, a thunderous, uniform roar reverberates through the forest. Something gigantic is approaching the Temple.

Whatever it is, it is slowly but surely stomping its way towards the Temple, and although it has so far remained largely out of sight, it has already proven to be an imposing presence.

Eunectes:
You're strong, Gavial. There's no doubt about that.

Eunectes:
I wasn't going to use this until after I took the throne.

Eunectes:
But I have to use it against you now.

Eunectes:
It doesn't matter. The end result will still be the same.

Eunectes:
This is going to bring us change.

Gavial:
I've got no idea what you're talking about, but I'm not going down that easy!

Eunectes:
Yes you are.

Eunectes:
...High Priest. Aim. Fire!

Gavial:
What's... that?!

Eunectes:
See? I told you, Gavial.

Eunectes:
But using it against you isn't what I'm trying to accomplish here.

Eunectes:
We won't have a future if we always rely on our fists.

Eunectes:
From here on out, we're in the age of machines.
