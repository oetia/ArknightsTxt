Gavial:
Doctor, we're pretty deep in the rainforest now.

Gavial:
It's a lot more humid here, and the trees get way denser too.

Gavial:
Watch your footing. Don't trip.

Gavial:
There's a tribe up ahead. Let's go take a look.

Inam:
*Yawn*... It's so boring here... I'm gonna take a nap...

Gavial:
Inam!

Inam:
Gavial? I heard you fought Zumama at the festival and got your ass handed to you. What are you doing here?

Gavial:
Well, news sure gets to you fast, Inam.

Gavial:
I gotta say, I thought Tomimi was pulling my leg when she said you're a tribal leader now, but here you are.

Inam:
It wasn't my decision. What can I do if they all want to follow me?

Gavial:
So why didn't you come to the ceremony?

Gavial:
Doctor, this is Inam, the girl Tomimi mentioned before.

Inam:
Whoa, a real, live outsider.

Inam:
Is this one of your friends from out there? Kinda shy, huh?

Gavial:
The Doctor just doesn't talk much.

Inam:
Yo! Gavial, you've got a pretty cheerful friend there. Just like you.

Gavial:
Hm? Inam, how come you know Sargonian too?

Inam:
Well, officially, I'm the Messenger for these parts here.

Gavial:
Messenger? Huh?

Inam:
You... whatever. I can tell you at least know what a Messenger is.

Inam:
Not like the boneheads here. Even if I told them, they wouldn't have any idea what it actually means.

Gavial:
Wait up. When did you become a Messenger?

Inam:
I've always been a Messenger...

Inam:
We're still technically within Sargon territory. You can't possibly think they know absolutely nothing about this whole area?

Gavial:
Huh? They don't though?

Inam:
Of course not! As far as I know, a couple centuries ago, this actually used to be a Sargon mining colony.

Inam:
When the Catastrophe happened, the whole nomadic city moved away, and they ended up abandoning the mine.

Inam:
The people who got left behind and the ones who came back later are our ancestors here.

Inam:
And I guess the higher-ups out there are thinking about repositioning those newer cities here to start putting the mine to use again.

Inam:
Like that time some ten years ago. You know the one.

Gavial:
Oh, you mean that one time? Both Zumama and I saw it. That's also the day she started acting really strange.

Inam:
Oh yeah? Well, I don't really know why they gave up on the idea. They probably had someone survey the area and realized the mine didn't have much value at all.

Inam:
If they did park a city here, it's gonna end up pretty far away from all the other ones.

Inam:
I heard this stretch of no man's land used to be a pretty prosperous place. No idea how long ago, though.

Inam:
Well, whatever. Let's talk about something else. I mean, I was like, uh...? How old was I again? Whatever, they sent me here after I became a Messenger.

Gavial:
Oh.

Inam:
Sheesh, I don't get to talk about this very often. Can't you at least pretend to be a little interested?

Gavial:
Nope, sounds like a pain. But if you're the Messenger here, how come I haven't ever seen you leave this place?

Inam:
Of course you haven't. You know how shut off we are? I've been outside to shop, but no one's ever had anything for me to mail!

Inam:
From the day I became a Messenger to this very day, you're the only person who's still had contact with this place after you left!

Inam:
And since I've got absolutely nothing to do, I've been trading things I buy from nearby cities to make a quick buck.

Inam:
And before you know it, I'm everybody's favorite shopkeeper, Inam.

Gavial:
How about that. I never knew.

Inam:
With how you used to be, I'd be more surprised if you did...

Inam:
But well, even though I grew up in the city, I definitely prefer living here.

Inam:
It's simple and laidback. What's not to like?

Gavial:
You don't really seem all that different from the other Liberi here, either.

Inam:
I'll take that as a compliment. Anyway, what are you doing here?

Gavial:
Let me ask you this first. What was AUS doing here? You didn't bring them here, did you?

Inam:
AUS? Of course not. Even someone like me who hardly follows that kinda stuff knows about them. I don't have that kind of pull.

Inam:
In fact, I was probably more surprised than anybody else when I saw them.

Inam:
They really were just passing by, and I was their interpreter while they were here.

Inam:
Oh, I could talk about them all day. You came at just the right time. I wasn't even sure how to brag about this when nobody here knows who they are.

Inam:
Check this out! I got this autographed album!

Gavial:
Eh, I'll pass. I'm not a fan anyway. I just thought it was weird.

Inam:
Ugh, Gavial, you've been out there so long, but your taste is just as terrible as ever.

Gavial:
You wanna get your ass whooped? Whatever. The Doctor and I are on our way to Zumama's, and we figured we'd stop by and resupply here.

Inam:
Alright. We could just barter like everyone here does, but since you know how things work on the outside, you can pay me with cold, hard cash.

Inam:
...Oh, wait up, I almost forgot since you were bombarding me with all these questions. I was actually looking for you for something too.

Gavial:
Huh?

Inam:
Do you have a friend called Croissant?

Gavial:
Croissant? Yeah, she's with us. We've been trying to find her. Have you seen her?

Inam:
You should take a look over at the market.

Archosauria A:
Come one, come all! Freshly carved wood sculptures right here!

Archosauria B:
Check out these ores passed down from my grandfather! Forge weapons sharper than anything you've ever seen!

Inam:
Haha, I was the one who taught them to peddle like that. It's something, isn't it?

Inam:
Look, there's Croissant.

In the corner of the market, Croissant is in a fierce standoff against a lone Archosauria.

Croissant gestures toward the ore her opponent is holding, and then points to the seashell in her hand. He shakes his head.

She frowns and waves her hand with a reluctant look.

She takes a rock out of her pocket and points at her seashell again. Then, she points at the ore in his hand once more. He ponders for a moment and nods.

Throughout the entire transaction, Croissant maintains a bitter expression, but the moment her trade partner turns around, her face immediately lights up with a bright smile.

Croissant:
Hooowee, that's a hell of an ore! What a prize!

Gavial:
Croissant, what are you even doing, bartering here?

Croissant:
Gavial, Baws! Finally! Took me ages to find y'all!

Croissant:
Never been better!

Croissant:
Ahaha. C'mon, Baws, why the face?

Croissant:
I was fixin' to have Inam here take me to that Temple to look fer y'all!

Croissant:
Sure can't, but it ain't like you need talkin' to do business!

Inam:
I came across her a couple days ago. I could tell she's not from around here, so I brought her with me.

Inam:
This girl really knows how to do business! She doesn't speak their language, but she really knows how to speak the language of trade with my men here.

Gavial:
I can see that. Croissant, have you come across anyone else?

Croissant:
Naw, and I asked Inam, too, but she says she ain't heard nothin' about that either.

Gavial:
Alright, at least you're alive and well. Now we just gotta find Utage and Blaze. I'm not too worried about Blaze. She jumped out the aircraft first, didn't even think twice. As for Utage...

Archosauria:
Inam, bad news. There's a group of Archosauria charging towards us!

Inam:
What? Which tribe is it? Are they out of their minds?

Archosauria:
Looks like the Great Wood Tribe! But they're being led by some freak with a sword!

Inam:
Huh? A freak?

Inam:
My man says a freak with a blade is charging toward us with a horde of Archosauria. What gives? !

Croissant:
Hold up, a freak carryin' a blade... Damn dagnabbit, it's gotta be Utage!

Inam:
Is she with you guys?  Tsk... In any case, it looks like they're here already. Gavial, and you, with the hood, come help us!

Croissant:
Oh, I'm comin' with y'all!

Utage:
C'mon, dudes, let's go!

Utage:
I mean, it's not like any of you know what I'm saying, but show 'em what you got~!

Utage:
Aha! I wasn't sure about this at first, but it's kinda fun taking these guys around to fight.

Gavial:
Hey, Utage, are you out of your mind? What are you even doing?!

Utage:
Oh, it's Gavial. Croissant and Doctor too! Heyas!

Gavial:
Who's heying ya?! Why are you attacking the village, and where'd you get these guys?!

Utage:
Huh? Is this your hometown? Alright, I'll knock it off.

Croissant:
Get these fellers to knock it off too!

Utage:
Uh, but, you know, they don't understand a word I say.

Gavial:
Tch... Looks like we're out of options. Let's take these idiots down.
