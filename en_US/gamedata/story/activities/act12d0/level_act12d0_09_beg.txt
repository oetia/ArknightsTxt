Gavial:
Tomimi, are you okay?

Tomimi:
I won't let you leave!

Gavial:
Huh? Why?

Tomimi:
B-because I don't want to be without you again!

Gavial:
Huh?

Tomimi:
I wanted to become Great Chief so I could force you to stay...

Eunectes:
Does that mean you're the one who organized the ceremony this time?

Tomimi:
Yes. If you didn't show up in the middle of it, I'd have become the Great Chief.

Eunectes:
...I see.

Gavial:
Huh? What are you guys talking about?

Gavial:
Hm? What are you talking about, Doctor? What's that about the ceremony?

Eunectes:
You're pretty smart, outsider.

Eunectes:
Just think about it for a minute, Gavial.

Eunectes:
Ever since you left, most of the tribes dissolved into the many smaller tribes we know today. Without a central leader, the tribes couldn't come together to do anything at all.

Eunectes:
So how could we suddenly put on a ceremony? There had to be someone organizing things behind the scenes.

Gavial:
Hm? Wasn't it you who organized the ceremony?

Eunectes:
It wasn't me. The Big Ugly still needed an engine. It wasn't done. I was planning to wait another year before contacting the other tribes to hold the ceremony, but then, all of a sudden, it was happening.

Eunectes:
It was unexpected, but I didn't mind. I thought that, even an incomplete Big Ugly could have shocked the world.

Eunectes:
The unexpected part was you coming back.

Gavial:
Now that you mention it, Tomimi was the one who asked me to return.

Gavial:
So you really did orchestrate everything.

Tomimi:
...Yes.

Tomimi:
I've been studying for years to learn what I would need to convince the other tribes to make me the Great Chief.

Tomimi:
But, it's not too late...The tribes under my command are waiting out there, and the Big Ugly has been defeated. No one can stop me from making Gavial stay!

Gavial:
Why do you want me here so badly?

Tomimi:
B-Because...

Tomimi:
W-Where am I...?

Tomimi:
Waahh... aahhh... I want to go home...

Tomimi:
Agh!

Gavial:
Hey, Tomimi. Are you okay?

Tomimi:
Gavial...

Gavial:
You're such a pain. I let you out of my sight for one second and you run off to a place like this.

Tomimi:
Gavial, you're bleeding!

Gavial:
Huh? It's fine, it's just a little cut.

Gavial:
Come on, let's go home.

Tomimi:
Gavial saved my life! I love her more than anyone!

Tomimi:
A-And, Gavial is the strongest. As long as Gavial is our Great Chief, she can lead everyone!

Gavial:
Here I was thinking that you're all grown up now, but you haven't changed a bit...

Gavial:
I've got important work to do, Tomimi. You can't stop me.

Tomimi:
...The books said: 'If I can't capture his heart, then I'll keep him close to me.' The books also said: 'As long as he is by my side, it doesn't matter if he hates me.'

Tomimi:
S-So, even if you hate me, Gavial, I still want you here!

Utage:
Whew... She's been slurping down trashy romance novels with a straw...

Tomimi:
Now the Big Ugly is down, and you're exhausted. You can't beat me!

Tomimi:
If you surrender, I-I won't hurt you!

Gavial:
You can't keep me here, Tomimi.

Tomimi:
...T-That's not up to you!

Tomimi:
Everyone, attack!
