Archosauria A:
Gyuh! That... That reaper's whirlwind... And that hairclip... Y-you're Gavial!

Gavial:
The one and only!

Archosauria A:
Damn it. Just our luck, running into you.

Archosauria A:
But don't get ahead of yourself, Gavial! Not even you could shake our faith in thick tails!

Gavial:
Yeah, you're such hot shit! Keep running!

Gavial:
Doctor, let's move. I can sort them out the next time I see them.

Tomimi:
Gavial, how come you let them go?

Tomimi:
You used to chase down every last person in a fight and beat them until they saw stars.

Gavial:
Yeah. I used to do that.

Gavial:
But nah, now I just think they're kind of cute. Right, Doctor?

Gavial:
Might sound strange coming from me, but this place is full of nothing but boneheads.

Gavial:
Ah, whatever. Have to think all the goddamn time outside. I almost miss it here.

Gavial:
Hey, Doctor, don't tell me you're a thick tail lover?

Gavial:
'Cause we're not gonna see eye-to-eye on that!

Gavial:
Hah! Well, thinking they're cute won't stop me beating the tar outta them.

Gavial:
They're not... uh... what's the word...? Mutually exclusive!

Tomimi:
Gavial... you really have changed.

Gavial:
Mm? Hold on, Tomimi, you little brat.

Tomimi:
Eh?

Gavial:
I go away for a couple years and I come back to find your tail's even fatter.

Tomimi:
Wh-wh-whuh?!

Gavial:
Gonna try and tell me you're with thick tails, too?

Tomimi:
No no no no! It's not like I wanted it to grow so thick!

Tomimi:
*Whimper* I want a nice, thin tail just like Gavial's...

Gavial:
Well, shucks. *Clicks tongue* What a poor kid you are.

Gavial:
Though watching you fight back there, your Arts are pretty strong now, huh?

Tomimi:
R... Really? !

Gavial:
Yeah. Come over to Rhodes Island and be an operator. Should be no problem for you.

Tomimi:
Ope... rator?

Gavial:
Operators are, uh... Well, I guess it's a job. Like me, I'm a Medic Operator.

Gavial:
I remember you were still learning from the shamans when I left, right?

Tomimi:
Yep! I've been disciplining myself every day for you, Gavial, so one day you'd come back!

Gavial:
For me?

Tomimi:
Oh... um, by that, I mean, for when you come back so I could help you out! Like I did just now!

Gavial:
Well, damn. You really did help out, then. Well done.

Tomimi:
Eheheh... I love when you compliment me.

Gavial:
Cool. Let's keep moving then. Do I remember the Temple's just ahead?

Tomimi:
Mm-hm.

Archosauria A:
Eunectes has to be the Great Chief, c'mon. Look at how strong the whole tribe is.

Archosauria B:
Yeah, and she's top of the pile. Everyone said if not Gavial, then Eunectes, and now Gavial's gone...

Archosauria C:
Hey, over there!

Archosauria B:
No way... Gavial?

Archosauria A:
Hey, Gavial! You're finally back!

Gavial:
Whoa! Long time no see, huh!

Archosauria A:
Hey, that feather on your waist is nice! Where'd it come from?

Archosauria B:
Traded one of my weapons to Inam for it.

Archosauria C:
Man, your tribe really has it good. Inam can get her hands on anything. I wish I could be with you guys too.

Archosauria B:
Too bad. Inam hates crowds. But if there's anything you guys want, you can go through me!

Archosauria A:
Deal! ...Hey. Look over there.

Archosauria C:
Is that... wait, it's Gavial!

Archosauria B:
She's actually back? !

Archosauria C:
Gavial! So you weren't dead!

Gavial:
Alive and well, baby!

Archosauria A:
Brother, come on. Stop trying to make a show. You've got the Stone Disease and all. Just go back home and lie down, okay?

Archosauria B:
Who cares! What's a little disease in the face of the ceremony?!

Archosauria A:
A little disease is still disease! And think about how bad it'd be for us if you went out there and showed everyone the rocks growing on your tail!

Archosauria A:
Look, Gavial might be gone, but now Zumama's sure to be the next Great Chief!

Archosauria B:
That's the part I care about! I need to witness the moment Zumama becomes Chief!

Archosauria B:
Damnit, I should have listened to Zumama... huh?  Brother, look over there!

Archosauria A:
It couldn't be. Is that... Gavial? !

Archosauria A:
Has she come back to become Great Chief?

Archosauria B:
...I'm sorry, but now I HAVE to see the ceremony.

Archosauria A:
Yeah. I don't think anyone can miss this now.

Tomimi:
Huh? Those two look like they're from the Eunectes tribe...

Archosauria B:
It really is Gavial! You're finally back!

Archosauria A:
I always believed in you, Gavial!

Archosauria C:
Hey, everyone, look! It's Gavial!

Archosauria:
Gavial! Gavial! Gavial!

Gavial:
Whew, what a rowdy bunch... Looks like we oughta pick up the pace.

Tomimi:
Mm-hm! Everyone loves the ceremony, after all. And everyone loves Gavial too!

Tomimi:
Oh. Gavial, look at that sign there.

Gavial:
Lemme see. Tch, goddamned scratchy handwriting... Oh, look at that. It says 'Mahuizzotia.'

Tomimi:
We're here.

Gavial:
Wait. What gives with the music?

Gavial:
And for that matter, why do I recognize it...

Gavial:
Wait! Doctor, this is an AUS song, isn't it?!

Gavial:
Well, damn.

Gavial:
I'm not totally sure myself, but I've definitely heard people playing this before.

Gavial:
Snap out of it, Doctor! Don't just walk in!

Gavial:
Lots of AUS fans at Rhodes Island. That's gotta be it.

Tomimi:
Ah. Yep, this is an AUS song.

Gavial:
How do you know what AUS is? !

Tomimi:
Around this time last year, a bunch of strange people calling themselves AUS came here from the outside.

Tomimi:
They held a concert at Inam's tribe first. After that, a whole lot of Tiacauh started treating them like heralds of the Mahuizzotia.

Gavial:
Huh?

Tomimi:
Later on, they were asked to stay for a long performance in the Temple surroundings.

Tomimi:
I got to hear them once. Their music really was powerful, and beautiful... you could feel their awesome Arts, too.

Tomimi:
Ever since, lots of Tiacauh fell in love with this kind of music.

Tomimi:
And then suddenly one day, they disappeared. Everyone said they'd gone back to their ancestors' embrace.

Tomimi:
But I knew they'd only left, same as Gavial had.

Tomimi:
The music playing right now should be coming from those 'speaker' things they left here. I think they also left behind some of their albums?

Gavial:
Speakers?

Tomimi:
Yep. They need Arts to function, so only priests and shamans can actually use them, and most of them are in Inam's tribe.

Gavial:
Hahaha! Now that's a band of freewheelers.

Gavial:
Can't deny, their songs really get up in there. I haven't even stepped in and they've got my blood running hot. I think I'm beginning to like them!

Gavial:
Let's go, Doctor! We're gonna hear some music and enjoy a hell of a show!
