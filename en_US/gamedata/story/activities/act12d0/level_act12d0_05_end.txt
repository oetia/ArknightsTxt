Gavial:
Alright, so why did you charge this place with those Archosauria again?

Utage:
Well, I saw a village here, and I just thought it'd be fun to start a fight.

Croissant:
...I guess that's our Utage. Yer like a whole 'nother gal in a fight.

Utage:
Aww, I'm sorry...

Gavial:
But how did you even manage to round up these guys without speaking their language?

Utage:
Honestly, I don't really know.

Utage:
Urgh, my nails are ruined. I'm so pissed.

Utage:
And just where the hell did my nail kit go? Now I'm twice as pissed.

Utage:
And I'm hella gross and sweaty after that fight. Plus, the air here is so humid, my clothes are totally soaked. Now I'm three times as pissed.

Utage:
And I'm, like, just walking around. Why do these Archosauria people keep coming up to me, picking fights? Now I'm four times as pissed.

Utage:
And I only tagged along 'cause I heard this would be a nice place for a vacation. This is totally not a vacation spot!

Utage:
Hmm? Is someone sneaking up on me? Are those... Archosauria?

Utage:
Then I beat up all the sneaky dudes.

Utage:
And then some more of them came, so I beat all of them up.

Utage:
And somehow they all started to, like, worship me for some reason.

Inam:
Oh, I see. They probably thought you were some kind of exotic animal. After all, no one from around here looks like you.

Utage:
Huh?! Are you blind? How do you mistake a cutie like me for an animal?

Inam:
Uh, well, to tell you the truth, you probably do look kinda like a freak to the Archosauria.

Inam:
Also, I spotted the Great Wood Tribe's leader among your people, so I asked him. Apparently you're their leader now.

Utage:
I'm what?

Inam:
Basically, you defeated the tribe's leader, and they're following you around because they look up to you as their leader now.

Utage:
Huh? They don't even understand a word I'm saying!  I thought they were just tagging along for fun!

Inam:
That's what happens when you're strong enough here.

Utage:
What should I do, Doctor...?

Utage:
Nnng... so mean!

Utage:
Nng... Don't look at me like that, Doctor.

Utage:
I didn't mean to...

Utage:
Eh? I don't wanna! Life without TV and AC? You might as well just kill me.

Gavial:
Whatever, we found you and Croissant. Now we just need to look for Blaze.

Utage:
Blaze is probably fine. I can't imagine anything slowing her down.

Croissant:
Me neither. Oh, yeah, Baws, what's the plan now? We goin' to the Temple fer that ceremony Gavial was talkin' about?

Gavial:
Oh, right, you two haven't heard yet. Doctor, why don't you tell them?

Explain the situation to Utage and Croissant.

Croissant:
Uh huh. Alrighty then, so we gon' be lookin' fer this Zumama to get yer engine back?

Gavial:
That's right.

Utage:
Eh? You mean the ceremony's over already?

Gavial:
Yep.

Utage:
Then what did I even come here for?

Utage:
Whatever, it doesn't sound like something I'd care about anyway.

Utage:
Also, Gavial, I thought you said this was a vacation spot!

Gavial:
Huh? You don't think this place is great?

Utage:
Well, actually, I guess, yeah, it's great!

Utage:
But, like, nothing here screams 'vacation!'

Gavial:
What screams 'vacation' to you?

Utage:
Like, beaches, oceans, parasols, and ice cream!

Utage:
I even got myself a new swimsuit! I've been wearing it underneath my outfit since before we left!

Croissant:
Eh, and here I tagged along just 'cause I got nothin' else to do...

Gavial:
Uh, I never said there's anything like that around here.

Utage:
Didn't you say we were gonna play in the water?!

Gavial:
Well yeah, that we can do. There's a huge waterfall deep in the rainforest.

Gavial:
And since we're heading to Zumama's tribe, we'll pass by the waterfall for sure.

Gavial:
Hell, I brought my swimsuit too. I just haven't taken it out yet.

Utage:
Really? Awesome!

Inam:
Well, it looks like you found who you're looking for.

Gavial:
Yeah, Inam, thanks to you.

Inam:
No problem.

Inam:
Oh I just remembered, where's Tomimi? I thought she was supposed to be with you guys.

Gavial:
No idea. I think she had something else to take care of. We'll group up with her later.

Inam:
Alright, bring her these books, then, will you?

Gavial:
What do we have here? 'City Beauty', 'Mastering Corporate Management in 100 Days', 'How to Become a Fashion Expert'...

Gavial:
These are some weird titles!

Inam:
She's been learning Sargonian and what life in the outside world is like. After I taught her the basics, of course.

Utage:
Hm, I can't imagine these books help much with her Sargonian.

Inam:
You're right. But that's really how she learned it. Letter by letter, word by word.

Inam:
It may not be the best material to learn from, but it was more painful to see her not having a clue where to start.

Inam:
That's also why I decided to teach her Sargonian.

Inam:
You know, Gavial, she's really working hard to get to where you are.

Gavial:
...You don't need to tell me. I know.

Inam:
But well, I don't know that much about what it's like outside either. Besides, I can only bring so many books with me, so I don't really know whether she's learning anything useful from them, haha.

Gavial:
...No wonder there's always something weird about her.

Gavial:
Hang on, don't tell me you're the one who taught Zumama Sargonian too.

Inam:
Nope. I'm pretty curious about that myself. She did have me find her books on machinery, but it was like she just picked up Sargonian out of nowhere.

Inam:
And she's even teaching it to her tribe.

Gavial:
...Doctor, what do you think?

Gavial:
You think so too, huh?

Gavial:
You want me to think about it myself, huh?

Gavial:
Hm, alright. I'll settle this my way.

Inam:
Since you're a new customer, I'll let you have it for 300 dinar.

Utage:
That's the look of a Doctor who just doesn't care.

Croissant:
Eh? T'ain't nothin' wrong with her teachin' Sargonian. If'n people here could talk with folks out there, they'd live a lot better.

Inam:
Maybe. The way I think about it, compared to your supposedly much better lives, I think our way of life out here is satisfying enough.

Inam:
I don't think you city folks would understand, though.

Croissant:
That so...?

Utage:
Oh, I think I get it! I mean, I lived in the countryside back in Higashi, too.

Croissant:
Eh? I took you for a city girl, what with how trendy you are.

Utage:
Nope, this is just the kinda stuff I like.

Inam:
*Yawn*... I'm tired... time for a nap.

Inam:
Here at our tribe, anything we leave out's for trade. If something catches your eye, have Gavial translate for you.

Inam:
Hmm?
