Gavial:
Oof... Ah.. That hurts a little...

Tomimi:
Gavial, you're awake! Are you okay?!

Gavial:
I'm fine. Just a scratch.

Gavial:
More importantly, is that the machine Zumama's been tinkering with all this time?

Tomimi:
Yes. I heard them calling it 'The Big, Ugly Thing.'  So gross...

Gavial:
It's pretty badass!

Tomimi:
So... Err, huh?

Tomimi:
But the big thing definitely beat you down...

Gavial:
I can tell it's really tough, even through it knocked my lights out before I got a good look at it.

Tomimi:
Hmm, yes it is...

Gavial:
But I never imagined she'd actually put together something like this.

Gavial:
Closure makes some weird gadgets every once in a while, yeah, but even she'd be impressed with Zumama's machine here. Haha.

Tomimi:
Wow, are there lots of things like that at Rhodes Island?

Tomimi:
Waaaa! Rhodes Island sounds scary...

Gavial:
Haha, Rhodes Island would blow your little mind.

Gavial:
Haha, now that you mention it, that thing would drive Closure up the wall as soon as she laid eyes on it.

Gavial:
Hm? What happened to the Temple?

Tomimi:
That monster blew it up.

Gavial:
Oh, so that means the ceremony's over?

Tomimi:
Yes.

Gavial:
And so Zumama's the Great Chief now?

Tomimi:
Yes...

Tomimi:
Everyone was pretty shocked at first, but...

Eunectes:
Why did I destroy the Temple? It's simple.

Eunectes:
It's my way of telling you all we're ending this tradition.

Eunectes:
With your fists, you can beat down ten men. If you're Gavial, maybe you take a hundred. But more than that?

Eunectes:
Even Gavial couldn't manage.

Eunectes:
There's a limit to what you can do with your fists.

Eunectes:
But with a tool? That's different. My tribe created this 'Big, Ugly Thing' that effortlessly took down Gavial and destroyed the Temple just as easily.

Eunectes:
This is the power of a tool.

Eunectes:
Tools can make you all even stronger!

Eunectes:
And so I hereby proclaim the age of machines!

Tomimi:
Everyone bought into it, so...

Gavial:
So she became the Great Chief. Hah, well, that's an L for me, obviously.

Gavial:
Huh? Yep. A loss is a loss.

Gavial:
Hey, Doctor, I don't need your comfort. I'm really fine.

Gavial:
Hmph, duh. Do you know me?

Gavial:
Oh, but I have to apologize to Tomimi. It's my fault you never got a chance to fight.

Tomimi:
...That's okay. Even if I went up there, it wouldn't have changed anything.

Gavial:
Yeah, you're right about that one.

Gavial:
Hey, Doctor, what do we do now?

Gavial:
Ah, right! We need the engine to get back.

Gavial:
And as for the others, if we didn't see them at the ceremony, maybe they got lost?

Gavial:
Still thinking it over, Doctor? No rush. We've got some vacation time left.

Gavial:
Haha, I love this Doctor! Then let's get some sightseeing in while we look for the engine and the girls.

Tomimi:
Erm, well...

Gavial:
Huh? Those two over there...

Archosauria A:
Hey, Yota, are you okay?!

Archosauria B:
Yeah, it's just, it kinda...

Archosauria A:
Yota!

Archosauria A:
I need a shaman!

Gavial:
Hey, let me take a look.

Archosauria A:
Gavial? You're alive?

Gavial:
Takes more than that to kill me.

Gavial:
Shut up for now. Lay your brother out and I'll look him over.

Gavial:
Tomimi, get my medical bag.

Tomimi:
Oh, okay!

Archosauria A:
Is he gonna be alright?!

Gavial:
He's not dead. But he's not looking good either.

Gavial:
Shortness of breath, foamy, bloody spittle... Hm?  And Originium crystals on the body? !

Gavial:
...Doctor, my initial diagnosis is heart failure brought on by Oripathy.

Archosauria A:
What?

Gavial:
It's Stone Disease. The symptoms aren't too bad. I have some emergency medicine in my bag, but we need to treat him right away.

Gavial:
Stand him up. He can't lay down. I'll give him some oxygen.

Archosauria A:
The Stone Disease did this? Ugh, I told him not to push it.

Gavial:
......

Gavial:
Hey, what's your name?

Archosauria A:
I'm Yogi. That's my brother, Yota.

Gavial:
Which tribe?

Yogi:
Eunectes.

Gavial:
......

Tomimi:
What's wrong, Gavial? Your face is scaring me.

Gavial:
Not now.

Gavial:
I'm asking again: Did Zumama send you into the mines to get ore for her big metal monster?

Yogi:
Yes. Why?

Gavial:
......

Gavial:
I'm sorry, Doctor. No matter what, I have to pay Zumama a visit.

Gavial:
Nothing gets past you, Doctor.

Gavial:
You're the Doctor, you definitely know why.

Gavial:
Sorry again, Doctor. But I have to do this.

Gavial:
Our tribes don't have much contact with the outside world. To you and the other operators, we're a primitive backwater.

Gavial:
But there is one good thing about this place. You heard it, right? They call Oripathy  'Stone Disease' and treat it like an ordinary malady.

Gavial:
Sometimes people catch it, sometimes they die of it. But nobody thinks it's anything special, because people here die from lots of things.

Gavial:
Everyone looks after Oripathy patients like they're just regular sick people. All they know about the disease is you can catch it in the mines.

Gavial:
So very few people go into the mines. It's been that way for a long time.

Tomimi:
Gavial caught it when she saved me.

Gavial:
Yeah. When Tomimi was little, she snuck into the depths of the mines. I went to rescue her, and I got sick.

Gavial:
Lucky she didn't.

Tomimi:
If only I got it instead...

Gavial:
Don't you dare say that. Getting sick is a terrible thing. It's just bad luck.

Tomimi:
(Whimper)

Gavial:
You've asked that a couple of times, Doctor.

Gavial:
After I got sick, the other tribespeople wouldn't let me do anything. I couldn't hunt, I couldn't even go to a gathering.

Gavial:
And the little runt Tomimi here was the worst. She came over from her tribe and stuck to me like glue. She did everything for me, and I had nothing to do.

Gavial:
In the end, they wouldn't even let me join the ceremony.

Gavial:
Day after day, time after time, it was 'Oh no, Gavial, let me do that for you,' you know what I mean...? That's no life for me.

Tomimi:
Gavial didn't smile much after that...

Gavial:
I was so pissed off, I went to the ceremony anyway, and beat the tar out of everyone I saw on the way.

Tomimi:
*Sob*, I shouldn't have been so pushy, Gavial...

Gavial:
The reality is, around here, if you can't fight, you're nothing. A waste of space.

Gavial:
I'd rather you let me put myself in danger than take away my freedom to do anything.

Gavial:
Doctor, don't you think this is funny?

Gavial:
I think it's funny. Only after I left the tribe did I realize what kind of hatred people have for Oripathy sufferers.

Gavial:
It took me a long time to figure that out.

Gavial:
Tch, watch that tongue of yours, Doctor, or I'll rip it out.

Gavial:
But I know what you mean. Out there, discrimination is what you get as an Oripathy patient.

Gavial:
What I went through back then, though, that was still torture for me.

Gavial:
Hey, you got me off on a tangent there. This isn't what I wanted to talk about.

Gavial:
Hmm... What was I saying?

Gavial:
Oh, right.

Gavial:
Doctor, help me out here.

Gavial:
Oh, I got it.

Gavial:
Bullshit.

Gavial:
Oh, I got it.

Gavial:
I was thinking about how that great big monster of a machine must've taken a ton of iron ore to build.

Gavial:
Put that together with what Zumama was saying,  and we know she definitely sent her people down into the mines to get that ore.

Tomimi:
Now that you mention it, I have heard something like that.

Gavial:
Now I've got no problem with that, on its face. If she just had them digging around on the outside, no big deal.

Gavial:
But now people are getting sick, and I have to do something.

Gavial:
I don't care about her age of machines or whatever. If she's throwing away lives, she's earned a clobbering.

Gavial:
Thanks, Doctor.

Gavial:
Ooh, you've got that penetrating gaze, Doctor.

Gavial:
Hah, but of course.

Tomimi:
Gavial...

Tomimi:
......

Gavial:
Tomimi, where is Zumama's tribe?

Tomimi:
Um, I don't know.

Yogi:
Hey, Gavial, I'm really not interested in your hopes and dreams and ideals here. What's up with my brother?

Gavial:
Huh? You can understand our Sargonian?

Yogi:
Yes. The leader taught all of us.

Gavial:
...What is that Zumama up to?

Gavial:
Whatever. Anyway, Tomimi, get your minions to carry this one back to your tribe. Have Lancet-2 start treating him.

Yogi:
Hey, what are you doing?!

Gavial:
If you want your brother to live, you'll put your trust in me.

Tomimi:
...Okay then, I'll take him back with me.

Gavial:
Oh? You're not coming with me?

Tomimi:
Ah! N-No! Of course I want to go with you, Gavial. But I have a few things that need doing first. I'll catch up with you later!

Gavial:
What things? Need my help?

Tomimi:
N-No! I can take care of it myself!

Tomimi:
Gavial, do you remember the great waterfall? We'll meet up there!

Gavial:
Okay.

Yogi:
Alright. You're the one and only Gavial, I trust you. But I'm going with!

Gavial:
No, you won't be any help. And there's something I need you to do for me.

Yogi:
What?

Gavial:
Go tell Zumama we need to have a talk.
