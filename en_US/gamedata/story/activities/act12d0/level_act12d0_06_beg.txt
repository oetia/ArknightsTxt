Eunectes:
High Priest, how is it looking?

High Priest:
I have to say, that cannon was so astoundingly loud, I almost got blown out of the thing when it fired!

Eunectes:
I'm asking you about the Big, Ugly Thing.

High Priest:
I was just sharing my personal situation with you. It went exactly as we expected. Firing the cannon in succession caused it to overheat.

High Priest:
But it went very well. Yes, I have to say, it was very effective! Despite the fact that it gave me quite the scare!

High Priest:
In any case, we will have to fix it up after we get back.

Eunectes:
Yeah, the ceremony happened way too quickly. The Big Ugly wasn't ready yet.

Eunectes:
I was hoping to wait until we finished it before talking to the other tribes about the ceremony, but they'd already gone ahead with it.

High Priest:
It's okay. It all turned out fine!

High Priest:
I still remember how shocked everyone was when they first saw the Big, Ugly Thing! Haha, that was so funny!

Eunectes:
Yeah, we've accomplished our goal.

High Priest:
This will set in motion a new order! A new era! Yes, an age of machines! That has such a nice ring to it!

High Priest:
What do you think of the 'Age of Big Ugly'? Oh, maybe the 'Age of the High Priest' too. Yes, that sounds almost as cool as I do.

Eunectes:
Let's just call it the age of machines.

High Priest:
Sheesh, you have a lot going for you, but you're still behind the times. Now that you've learned what it's like outside, you should try to expand your horizons!

High Priest:
Here, check out my outfit. Don't you think it's trendy? Looks smart?

Eunectes:
You're so short, I can't even see it. What does trendy mean, anyway?

High Priest:
Argh, never mind. My mistake. I shouldn't have brought this up. But no matter. I'll pick out some clothes befitting you, our next Great Chief.

Eunectes:
I don't mind how I dress. Anyway, I just got word from the tribesmen who stayed behind. They managed to steal an engine.

High Priest:
What? Really?

Eunectes:
Yes, apparently they got it from the transport Gavial used to get here.

High Priest:
Wonderful! I can't wait to take a good look at it!

High Priest:
Oh, come to think of it, I can go check it out right now! I'll see you later!

Eunectes:
The High Priest's the same as ever.

Archosauria A:
Hey, who was the Liberi talking to the leader?

Archosauria B:
What, you new here? That's the High Priest! You know, the Big Ugly's pilot!

Archosauria A:
What? I want to pilot the Big Ugly!

Archosauria B:
Give it up. Before it was finished, that thing used to explode just about every day. So many hands got caught up in the explosions, in the end no one wanted to pilot it.

Archosauria B:
Then the High Priest came along, and he somehow managed to come back alive every time it blew up!

Archosauria A:
No kidding? He's that good? !

Archosauria B:
Yeah, I've got no idea what tribe he's from, but we all call him the High Priest now!

Archosauria A:
Hm? Isn't that Yogi over there? Hey, Yogi.

Yogi:
Oh, it's you two.

Archosauria A:
I thought you were taking care of your brother. Where is he?

Yogi:
Actually, I'm going to the leader to talk about that.

Archosauria A:
You idiot, she's the Great Chief now!

Yogi:
Oh, I'm going to the Great Chief.

Eunectes:
What's the matter?

Yogi:
Great Chief, my brother has caught the Stone Disease.

Eunectes:
Speak Sargonian.

Yogi:
Oh, yes, sorry. I'm not very good at speaking it yet.

Eunectes:
...How did he catch the disease?

Yogi:
He wanted to mine more ores and went deeper into the mine. He didn't even listen to me when I told him not to...

Eunectes:
That idiot! Didn't I tell you to stay away from the mine's depths?!

Eunectes:
Where is he now?

Yogi:
Gavial took him away for treatment.

Eunectes:
Gavial?

Yogi:
Yes, it looks like Gavial actually became a doctor. My brother was in a lot of pain, but he seemed much better after she patched him up a bit.

Eunectes:
...So she really meant it when she said she's a doctor now.

Yogi:
She wanted me to pass along a message too.

Eunectes:
What is it?

Yogi:
She said she was coming for you. She looked angry.

Archosauria A:
Hmph, I bet she's just upset our leader defeated her!

Archosauria B:
That's right, leader! What you did back there. That boom! That was amazing!

Archosauria A:
You didn't call her Great Chief!

Archosauria B:
You didn't either!

Archosauria A:
Get off my back, you moron! She'll always be our tribe leader!

Archosauria B:
Why don't you get off my back? I just haven't gotten used to calling her that yet!

Eunectes:
Gavial isn't like that.

Yogi:
Great Chief, I trust Gavial.

Eunectes:
Yes, I trust her too. Your brother will be fine. Where is he?

Yogi:
At Tomimi's tribe.

Eunectes:
Tomimi's... You should go get your brother later.

Yogi:
Understood.

High Priest:
I'm certain Gavial's here to get her engine back!

Eunectes:
...She'll have to go through me to get it.

Eunectes:
I'll admit that Gavial's strong, but she thinks her fists are everything.

Eunectes:
She's wrong.

Eunectes:
If she's here for her engine, then I'll give her another taste of the Big Ugly's might.

Eunectes:
...But I won't give it back to her. This engine is very important to our tribe, no, our future.

???:
Did you just mention Gavial?

Eunectes:
Flint, did you hear that?

Archosauria A:
Why don't you cry in your bed some more about the Great Chief?!

Archosauria B:
And why don't you go home to your mama and have her teach you what to call the Great Chief?!

Flint:
Knock it off, you two.

Archosauria A:
Gah!

Archosauria B:
You... Kemar?

Flint:
You don't want her to come, do you?

Eunectes:
If she comes, I'll defeat her.

Flint:
So you don't you want her here. Then I'll stop her.

Eunectes:
Very well.

Flint:
I'll be going, then.

Flint:
......

Eunectes:
Back already?

Flint:
Err, where is Gavial?

Blaze:
Tch, this rainforest's way too humid! I've barely hiked half a day and I'm already drenched in sweat! And I haven't seen a soul in the two days I've been here!

Blaze:
Thank goodness I wore my swimsuit underneath. What a lifesaver. I'm really getting my money's worth with it.

Blaze:
Really, though. Even when I climb the trees here, all I see is more trees! Just where's that ceremony Gavial was talking about?

Blaze:
Hey, is anyone here?!

Blaze:
Hey, Gavial, your tail's tiny!

Blaze:
Hey, Doctor, maybe it's time for you to change that hood of yours!

Blaze:
...Tsk, they aren't within earshot.

Blaze:
Ugh, if something happens to the Doctor, what am I supposed to tell Amiya?

Blaze:
I guess I shouldn't worry since Gavial said she'd take care of the Doctor, but... I'm not sure that's all that reassuring, knowing her.

Blaze:
Urgh, the more I think about it, the more worried I am. Maybe I should try knocking a few trees down to make some noise.

Flint:
...According to Yogi, I should find Gavial if I go this direction.

Blaze:
Whoa, finally! A person!

Blaze:
Hey there!

Flint:
I haven't seen clothes like that before. Who are you?

Blaze:
Huh? What are you saying?

Flint:
You don't understand me?

Blaze:
Urgh, is this for real? Gavial didn't tell me people here speak a different language!

Flint:
But it looks like you can hold your own in a fight.

Blaze:
Hey, c'mon! This how you people treat visitors?

Flint:
Just as I thought, you're strong.

Flint:
Before I take Gavial down, I'll have some fun with you first.

Blaze:
Hm? Did she just say Gavial?

Blaze:
Whatever, I'm in a pretty bad mood right now. If you want to fight, then bring it on!
