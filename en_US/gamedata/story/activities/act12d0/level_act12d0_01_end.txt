Archosauria A:
Cue. Titecuani! She... she's something.

Gavial:
Whaddaya know, you guys are pretty strong! Shame you had to run into me, Gavial!

Archosauria B:
Wait... wait, what did you say your name was?

Gavial:
Ga-vi-al!

Archosauria A:
Gavial? !

Archosauria B:
Wait! Look close! That face, that hair! You're Gavial, aren't you?!

Gavial:
I feel like I just said I was!

Archosauria A:
It-It's Gavial! Gavial's back!  Brothers! Go, hurry! Tell Clan Leader Eunectes!

Gavial:
What? Eunectes? Hey! Get back here!

Gavial:
Tch. Ran off.

Lancet-2:
Thank goodness! If you'd been just a little later, they would've taken me.

Gavial:
Where's our pilot guy? Uh, his name, uh, Dylan! Where's Dylan?

Lancet-2:
He tried to fight some of the Archosauria in the middle of it all. They knocked him out.

Ceobe:
Oh! Gavial, I found Dylan here!

Gavial:
Good. Drag him over. I'll take a look at the damage.

Ceobe:
Okay!

Gavial:
Say, Lancet-2, you can fix this aircraft, right?

Lancet-2:
Yes! Closure input lots of aircraft knowledge into me before we left.

Lancet-2:
In principle, following a successful emergency landing, the tools provided should be sufficient for a repair.

Lancet-2:
Only...

Gavial:
Kay, I asked you to drag him over, not to LITERALLY drag him over.

Ceobe:
Oh. Sorry.

Gavial:
...Looks like they didn't get any kills on us, huh? Wow, who knew this guy's underwear would be so gaudy... heh. Yeah, let him have his beauty sleep and he'll wake himself up.

Gavial:
Lancet-2, you were saying? Only what?

Lancet-2:
Only, the Archosauria we just met stole the engine.

Gavial:
Hah? The engine?

Lancet-2:
Correct. Before they noticed me, I sighted them from the deck. They found the aircraft's engine, pulled it out, and carried it away with them.

Lancet-2:
Come see for yourself.

Gavial:
Hoo, boy. Yeah, that's a hole. I don't really get how these things actually work, but, uh, I'm guessing this means it won't fly now?

Lancet-2:
Yes, it won't fly now.

Gavial:
Oh? Doctor, you don't look too good.

A short while back

Kal'tsit:
A letter?

Gavial:
Yeah. From my homeland. They're holding the Mahuizzotia again soon.

Kal'tsit:
'Mahuizzotia.' Strength and honor?

Gavial:
Huh, you know it? Yeah, it's what they call the ceremony where they choose the next Great Chief.

Kal'tsit:
I haven't heard anyone use that language in a long time.

Kal'tsit:
As I recall, though, you left your homeland and then came to Rhodes Island.

Gavial:
Yeah, but there’s this li’l kid I knew who still keeps in touch with me. She’s the one who sent the letter.

Kal'tsit:
I also recall you saying that you left because you were ostracized. If so, the election of the chief shouldn't concern you at all.

Gavial:
Yeah... hell, no, I'm not going out to be the next Great Chieftain. Just, the brat seems like she really wants me to come back for a bit, and I haven't been back in a bit, and...

Kal'tsit:
Homesickness?

Gavial:
Maybe a little, yeah.

Kal'tsit:
And why are you requesting to bring Dr. {@nickname}? From a biological standpoint, the Doctor couldn't pass for one of you.

Gavial:
The Doctor's been working so hard, y'know? I figured it'd be a nice little vacation.

Kal'tsit:
And what was the purpose of this aircraft requisition form, Blaze?

Blaze:
Gavial's old place is way out in the middle of nowhere Sargon! Who'd walk that far?

Kal'tsit:
So instead of walking, you want to use a low-altitude aircraft and risk detection by the Sargon authorities.

Blaze:
Wait, lemme explain! When I say nowhere, I mean we looked at the maps and Gavial's is one of the lest densely populated regions of Sargon. From the intel we've gathered, Sargon doesn't even station any forces there.

Kal'tsit:
You're correct that the region is Sargon's in name only. You've done your homework.

Kal'tsit:
And now, seeing as you've made all your plans, why have you come to me?

Blaze:
B-Because any and all paperwork passes through you...

Kal'tsit:
......

Gavial:
Are we good or not, Kal'tsit? If not, we'll forget it and move on.

Blaze:
(Quietly) Doctor, maybe we should just call it off. There's no way Kal'tsit's gonna agree...

Kal'tsit:
Fine. I've approved it.

Blaze:
Seriously? !

Kal'tsit:
Gavial, you've never properly introduced us to your hometown before.

Kal'tsit:
And considering your standing as a core member of Rhodes Island, and the initiative you showed in making this proposal, we can afford to grant Dr. {@nickname} this leave, given accompaniment by an elite operator.

Blaze:
That's what I like to hear!

Kal'tsit:
Further, I will treat this operation as an on-site field investigation. You may freely select any off-duty operators.

Kal'tsit:
Amiya has been very busy as of late. She is not allowed to go, whether she wants to or not. You will have to tell her this yourself.

Kal'tsit:
Keep in mind that you are technically entering Sargon territory. Rhodes Island has very few offices in Sargon. Don't make trouble for yourselves, or for Rhodes Island.

Kal'tsit:
Further, Rhodes Island's low-altitude aircraft are tremendously important to us, and Sargon is a rough environment. I trust you to bring the vehicle back safe and sound, Dr. {@nickname}.

Gavial:
Ohhh. Now that you mention it, yeah, that sounds about right.

Gavial:
Hey, relax, Doctor! This is my homeland. I know it like the back of my hand. Lancet-2, we've just gotta find the kiddos who stole the engine and steal it right back, yeah?

Lancet-2:
Yes... They definitely seemed to have some understanding of technology, at least. They hardly damaged anything else in the removal process.

Lancet-2:
In the event we do get the engine back, I should be able to guide you through reinstallation.

Lancet-2:
On that note, there's some emergency maintenance I must carry out before any of this ends up exploding. Please hold...

Gavial:
Huh? Them? Technology? First I've heard of any of us getting along with technology. We're all knuckleheads by nature.

Lancet-2:
Specifically, only enough to know how to pull out the pipes and cables, but...

Gavial:
...Wait, hold on. I bet if they're her minions...

Ceobe:
Gavial, I'm hungry!

Gavial:
All our food reserves should be fine, right?

Lancet-2:
They should be fine, yes.

Lancet-2:
But some systems were damaged by the emergency landing. The storage compartment is currently sealed. I'll need some time to unlock it again...

Gavial:
Hang in there a little longer, then, Kay.

Ceobe:
But I'm hungry nowww!

Gavial:
Fine, then. Let's go and...

???:
Gaaaaviiiiaaaaal!

Gavial:
Huh? Oh, crud. I know that voice.

???:
Wow, Gavial! You're actually here!

???:
Gavial, your hair's gotten long!

???:
Gavial, your clothes look really good!

???:
Gavial, you have a weapon now! How come? It doesn't look very good for hitting people!

Gavial:
Gurgh! Yes, Tomimi, it's me, you're not imagining it. Just let go of me first!

Tomimi:
Okay!

Tomimi:
Gavial, have you been eating okay out there?

Tomimi:
Did you really become a doctor?

Gavial:
...*Sigh* What are you doing here, Tomimi?

Tomimi:
So I saw a thing fall out of the sky, and I went to see what it was, and then I saw you!

Tomimi:
Oh, is your disease thing better yet?  I read that people outside can get Stone Disease really bad. Are you okay?

Gavial:
I'm fine, I'm fine. Never better.

Archosauria:
Gavial! You're really back!

Archosauria:
It's good to see you alive and well after all, Gavial!

Archosauria:
No mistake, you need to be our next Great Chief!

Gavial:
Dream on. I'm only on leave. Came back to see how things are going.

Gavial:
Yeah. Why?

Tomimi:
Gavial, who-who is this person?

Gavial:
Huh? Tomimi, you can speak standard Sargonian now? Pretty fluently too.

Tomimi:
Yep! I learned it just so I could speak with you, Gavial!

Gavial:
Not bad. I guess I'll write to you in Sargonian from now on, then.

Tomimi:
...So, um, Gavial, who are all these people?

Gavial:
Oh, this one's Dr. {@nickname}. Doctor, for short. Counts as my boss, I guess?

Gavial:
And then the rest are all friends from work.

Tomimi:
Gavial's boss... are you actually stronger than her?

Tomimi:
So how'd you get to be Gavial's boss, then?

Tomimi:
Gavial, this one looks pretty weak to me.

Tomimi:
No way!

Gavial:
I've got bigger problems, Tomimi. Zumama's people stole our aircraft engine after the crash. She's got minions now?

Tomimi:
What's an aircraft engine? Is it like one of those motory things? Wait, um... huh? Zumama?

Gavial:
What about her?

Tomimi:
Ah, um, Zumama's the chief of a tribe now. There's a lot of people who think she'll be the next Great Chief, too.

Gavial:
Aah... So that's how it is. Could've been her crew that took us down, too. She's the only one who was into those weird wacky gizmo weapons in the first place.

Tomimi:
...Yeah, yeah!  If you wanna find Zumama, the ceremony's starting tomorrow, and every aspiring Chief is gonna be at the Temple. Zumama'll be there for sure.

Gavial:
So all we gotta do to find her is head there, huh? Ha! Perfect.

Gavial:
Hey, didn't you say your cute little noggin wanted to compete for it too? Go on, show me how far you've come in all these years!

Tomimi:
(Quietly) I still want you to be the Chief, Gavial.

Gavial:
Huh? Whawazzat?

Tomimi:
N-Nothing!

Lancet-2:
Doctor, emergency maintenance has been completed. Are we setting off now?

Gavial:
Nice work, Lancet-2. Yeah, we're heading to the Temple next.

Tomimi:
Wowww! The machine talks!

Lancet-2:
I like to think I'm ready for it, but it still hurts my heart a little whenever I get that sort of reaction. Not that I technically have a heart...

Gavial:
Aircraft won't explode now, right?

Lancet-2:
It won't, but it's not exactly ideal to just leave it here...

Gavial:
Yeah, true. I don't want Kal'tsit giving me the death stare either.

Tomimi:
I-If I send, um, some of my people out to take it back to my tribe, would that help?

Gavial:
Your tribe? Huh? Hell, I didn't realize. So our little girl's a full-grown clan leader now, huh?

Tomimi:
Yes! It actually used to be your tribe, Gavial.

Gavial:
Well, damn. No wonder I recognized a couple of faces...

Tomimi:
Oh, also! Gavial, we changed the tribe's name now! 'Wilderness's Will' is now 'Gavial's Will'!

Gavial:
Hah?

Tomimi:
Because we all think you're the best, Gavial!

Gavial:
Uh—*cough* *cough*—okay, whatever. I'll leave you to it.

Tomimi:
Did everyone get that?

Archosauria:
Yeah!

Lancet-2:
Ah, in that case, I think Mr. Dylan and I will stay with the aircraft.

Lancet-2:
I understand you're going to meet a large number of people. I would only cause problems if I went.

Lancet-2:
And the aircraft does need guarding.

Gavial:
What? You're not gonna go see the ceremony? It's a hell of a treat.

Lancet-2:
Don't worry about it. I prefer the quieter side of things, anyway.

Gavial:
Suit yourself. I guess it'll be just me, the Doctor, and, uh, Kay going, then.

Tomimi:
And me! And I'll bring some of my people with us too!

Lancet-2:
Please wait a moment, Doctor. What about Kay?

Gavial:
What's up, Doctor?

Gavial:
Hm? Wait up. Where'd Kay go? !

Gavial:
Oh, huh. You're right, she was just here. Where'd that little rascal run off to?

Archosauria:
When you say Kay, do you mean the one jabbering away over there like she's half-possessed?

Ceobe:
I'm not gonna let you hurt the Doctor, Reunion!

Ceobe:
Nooo! Don't steal my honey biscuits! Get back here!

Lancet-2:
Kay appears to be fighting the air... Um, this could be a case of poison-induced hallucination.

Gavial:
Oh! Shit! I forgot to warn you! There's a hell of a lot of mushrooms and fruits growing wild along the road here, and more than most of them you can't eat. If you do, you end up like that.

Gavial:
Forgot the kid was even wilder than me. I bet she snuck off while we were busy talking and helped herself to the buffet.

Gavial:
Uh, damn it. Okay. Go tie her up and take her back with you, Lancet-2. She'll be fine after a while, probably.

Lancet-2:
Leave it to me~

Lancet-2:
Oh, one last friendly reminder. Our surroundings are quite hot, but such environments are prone to drastic nighttime temperature swings. Please bring the necessary supplies with you.

Gavial:
Oh, nice catch. Doctor, Tomimi, you two make sure you grab what you need from the aircraft.

Gavial:
It's a long way to the Temple from here, and the rainforest won't have anywhere decent to sleep. Get ready to spend the night in the open.
