Dylan:
Lancet-2, I have a serious question.

Lancet-2:
Go ahead.

Dylan:
Isn't your battery running low?

Lancet-2:
Oh, don't worry about that. Before we left, the lovely Ms. Closure fitted me with a brand new, extra long-lasting battery.

Lancet-2:
Theoretically, I could function for a week without needing a charge.

Lancet-2:
The aircraft is also carrying spare batteries, so you don't have to worry about me.

Dylan:
Okay.

Dylan:
Now where did Kay run off to? On our way back, the kiddo suddenly hopped to her feet and jetted away.

Lancet-2:
It's true, we should be concerned about Ceobe's condition, but considering her strength and constitution, we don't need to be too concerned.

Dylan:
That's true.

Dylan:
Hah, I'm bored.

Dylan:
We fixed up the aircraft, patched up the wounded Gavial sent over, and now we've got nothing to do.

Dylan:
That we can't speak the local language is just a cherry on top. I should've gone to that ceremony with the Doctor.

Lancet-2:
The aircraft is an important Rhodes Island asset, it's our responsibility to guard it well.

Dylan:
I'm just saying. I mean, I'm a pilot, I know the deal with the aircraft.

Dylan:
You're lucky, Lancet-2, you can just switch into sleep mode when you're bored. I was out for twelve hours yesterday, so I'm wide awake.

Lancet-2:
Well, actually, I have no ability to feel 'boredom'.

Lancet-2:
Although I do understand what this feeling is, Mr. Dylan. The lovely Ms. Closure complains about these things a lot. And it causes her to behave in strange ways.

Dylan:
...I think about this sometimes, Lancet-2, are we totally sure you and the other bots don't have a human crammed up in there anywhere?

Lancet-2:
We don't. My interior is a precisely-designed circuitry construct. Do you want to see?

Lancet-2:
Although, since I have been programmed with a female personality, I may act out in unexpected ways when presenting my body to the opposite sex.

Dylan:
Err, I'll pass.

Dylan:
If was going to see anything, I'd definitely prefer a swimsuit at a time like this.

Lancet-2:
A swimsuit?

Dylan:
Yeah, it's summertime. That's when you put on a swimsuit and go play in the water.

Lancet-2:
In that case, I'll play an audio recording of various sea sounds for you.

Dylan:
No thanks, it'd only make me feel worse.

Lancet-2:
...Then maybe... Mr. Dylan would like to see me in a swimsuit?

Dylan:
Definitely not!

Lancet-2:
Oh, sorry. I am only a robot, after all.

Dylan:
Err, I'm the one who's sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

Lancet-2:
Don't worry about it. By the way, have you seen the sea, Mr. Dylan?

Dylan:
Um, I have. I'm thinking it was that time we loaned Master SilverAsh an aircraft last summer after a schedule change mixed things up. I flew him there.

Dylan:
It turns out, the place was a major vacation spot. Master SilverAsh made me a VIP guest.

Dylan:
Man, that's when I realized how us poor folks could scarcely imagine what the rich live like.

Dylan:
Here, I've got the pictures with me.

Lancet-2:
You long for this kind of life, Mr. Dylan?

Dylan:
Hm? I mean... that was a really great couple of days, but if my whole life was like that, I don't think I'd ever get used to it.

Dylan:
I'm more of an instant-noodles-in-the-cockpit kind of guy. With an inverted sleep schedule to boot.

Lancet-2:
Oh you can't do that. Let me formulate a healthy lifestyle plan for you.

Dylan:
No thanks, I'm good!

Lancet-2:
Too bad. The lovely Ms. Closure created this feature for me, but no one uses it. Not her, not the Doctor.

Dylan:
Haha, sounds about right.

Dylan:
Oh, but that reminds me, the tribes here live so much better than I thought. They really want for nothing.

Lancet-2:
Yes, life here is less convenient and comfortable than the world we know, but not to any significant degree.

Lancet-2:
According to my records, your health has improved in the past two days.

Dylan:
Really?

Lancet-2:
Really.

Dylan:
Turns out returning to nature will do that for you. Heh. I guess this is the life that everyone came from.

Dylan:
Oh yeah, I just remembered, Gavial said something about a gigantic waterfall in the rainforest that way. I'd love to go there when the Doctor gets back.

Lancet-2:
They may have already gone that way.

Dylan:
The Doctor is a good boss. And I know our friends wouldn't abandon us to go play under the waterfall!

Lancet-2:
True. Then let's wait patiently.

? ??:
Is there a 'Dylan' here?

Dylan:
That's me!

Dylan:
Huh? You speak Sargonian?

Inam:
Yes. And you're here with the machine. Right, it must be you.

Inam:
The one called 'Doctor' asked me to give you this note.

Dylan:
Hm? Let's see here...

Dylan:
...Lancet-2, looks like we've got work to do.

Utage:
Wow! I could hear the roar of the water from so far away, I never knew waterfalls even got this big!

Gavial:
Hah, I didn't steer you wrong, did I?

Utage:
Sure enough. I guess I'll forgive you~

Blaze:
Haha! It really is an incredible waterfall.

Gavial:
Looks like Tomimi isn't here yet, so let's take a little break.

Utage:
Hooray! I can finally get some use out of my swimsuit~

Flint:
......

Blaze:
You got a lotta fight in you, squirt.

Flint:
......

Kemar, well aware of the language barrier, communicates with her stance, rather than words.

Blaze:
Heh. Seeing as I've got nothing else to do, we might as well go a few rounds.

Utage:
Blaze is really going at it hard with that girl over there.

Croissant:
Sure is.

Utage:
I don't see what's so fun about fighting.

Croissant:
...I heard you singin' a whole 'nother tune last time you was fightin', Utage.

Utage:
Ahahaha. I guess you're right.

Utage:
Hey, Croissant, that isn't a swimsuit, is it?

Croissant:
Ahahaha, ya got me. It's just some outdoorsy getup I snagged. Plenty waterproof, so we'n pretend it's a swimsuit.

Utage:
You're a real function over form kinda girl, huh?

Utage:
But hey, it may not be a beach, but playing around a waterfall is pretty great too! It's got that real 'back to nature' vibe. Too bad I didn't bring my camera.

Croissant:
Ya got that right. I ain't never been out in the wilds like this before. I'm havin' a ball!

Utage:
Hey...

Croissant:
Whassat?

Utage:
Am I seeing things?

Croissant:
Huh?

Utage:
Isn't that Kay?

Gavial:
How do you like the waterfall, Doctor?

Gavial:
Hah, I used to love coming here to bathe.

Gavial:
Looks like you've got a lot on your mind, Doctor.

Gavial:
You're cruisin' for a bruisin', Doctor.

Gavial:
From here it's just a short walk to Zumama's tribe.

Gavial:
When I got that letter from Tomimi, I never thought things would turn out like this.

Gavial:
...Oh, Doctor, there's one thing that's been really gnawing at my brain these past few days. We're friends, right? I wanna ask you about it.

Gavial:
Do you think...?

Utage:
Doooctooor!

Gavial:
What's happening? I'm trying to talk to the Doctor here.

Utage:
Look over there!

Gavial:
Is that... Kay?

Ceobe:
I found it! The Mushroom Sea!

Ceobe:
Bath time!

Gavial:
Looks like she's still off in la la land.

Utage:
But she's just so cute rolling around in the water like that.

Gavial:
Gah, stupid kid.

Gavial:
How about we just let her play for a while...?

Gavial:
Anyway, Doctor, what I wanted to ask wasâ€”

Gavial:
Do you think my tail's gotten fatter?

Gavial:
What? Really? I guess I'm going on a diet when we get back.

Gavial:
Come on, Doctor, don't look at me like that. An Archosauria's tail is her most prized asset! This is my life!

Gavial:
Pfft, I knew I shouldn't have asked you.

Gavial:
You don't know, Tomimi's tail wasn't always that fat. And I don't want mine to end up like hers.

Gavial:
Huh? What do I think about her?

Gavial:
I guess I think she's real tough, and she can make a helluva machine.

Gavial:


Gavial:
I had a feeling you'd be down with tails!

Tomimi:
Gavial!

Gavial:
There's Tomimi. You done with that thing?

Tomimi:
Yes!

Utage:
Hmmmmm?

Tomimi:
Wh-What?

Utage:
You're a cutie! Gavial, I never knew you had a friend like this. I thought you just hung around with other muscleheaded lunks like you.

Gavial:
That was uncalled for!

Utage:
She's got perfect skin, refined features, and a gothy outfit that really goes with her complexion.

Gavial:
Gothy? Is that in?

Utage:
Well, no. But it's popular with a certain crowd.

Tomimi:
I-I picked it up from a magazine. They said it's how they dress in the outside world.

Utage:
Oh, no, girl, honey. You've got a critically flawed understanding of fashion here. But that's okay. I mean, look at this place. I totally get why you'd come up with something like that.

Utage:
But don't worry, you just let Big Sister Utage fill you with her bottomless, extra-thick fashion wisdom!

Utage:
Gavial, I'm borrowing her!

Tomimi:
Wha? Whaaaaaaa?

Gavial:
Sure, knock yourself out.

Gavial:
Anyway, we're all here.

Gavial:
I'll see if I can get Kay to sober up...

Ceobe:
Break time's over! Kay is back in the fight!

Croissant:
Gavial, she's makin' a break for it again!

Gavial:
What?

Gavial:
Grr, everybody, get your clothes on! We're going after her!

Tomimi:
That direction... it's the way to Zumama's tribe...

Utage:
Hold on! Did you really change that fast?!

Utage:
Wait up!

Blaze:
Why bother changing? Just go!
