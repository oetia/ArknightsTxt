???:
Where are the others?

Clan Leader A:
The people of the Great Wood Tribe are gone. I heard that leader was defeated by an outsider.

Peta:
The Firestone and Thick Tail Tribes were defeated by an stranger carrying a pile of weapons on her back.

Clan Leader A:
Some of the tribes decided to join up with Zumama.

Clan Leader B:
The truth is Zumama's managed to drum up a formidable front. If I weren't with Gavial, I might have gone to Zumama myself.

???:
Doesn't matter.

???:
Your tribes will be enough.

Clan Leader B:
Hey, can we really challenge Zumama on our own?

???:
Yes.

???:
Gavial can definitely beat Zumama's giant machine. Then, I will become the Great Chief and force Gavial to stay.

Peta:
Peta thinks that is not a good idea.

???:
.......

???:
But this is the only way to make her stay.

???:
Don't forget why we formed 'Gavial's Will'!

???:
'Gavial's Will' is not just a tribe. It is an alliance dedicated to the vision of Gavial as the Great Chief!

Clan Leader B:
I agree with Tomimi. I'll only recognize Gavial as the Great Chief.

Clan Leader A:
That's right, Gavial should be the one to lead us!

Clan Leader C:
Hah, if I disagreed I wouldn't be here either!

Peta:
...Peta doesn't like it, but Peta will follow.

???:
Alright, you head over to Zumama's tribe and wait outside for me, got it?

Other Clan Leaders:
Yes.

???:
Right. This is all for Gavial.

Other Clan Leaders:
All for Gavial!

Blaze:
Doctor! Everyone! Great, I finally found you guys!

Blaze:
*Sigh*, Doctor, you had me worried.

Gavial:
Huh? Blaze, why are you wearing your swimsuit... and carrying some kid on your back?

Blaze:
I ran into this little girl on my way over here. She started hitting me for some reason.

Blaze:
I kicked her ass, of course, and beat down all her friends too.

Blaze:
Gotta hand it to her, she's not bad in a fight, didn't go down easy. So I brought her along. I figured you could help me ask why she wanted to fight me.

Gavial:
It's Kemar. She probably just thought you looked strong. She just loves fighting.

Blaze:
Hah. That means something, coming from you.

Gavial:
I don't love fighting. I'm just a hands-on problem solver.

Blaze:
Whatever.

Flint:
...Where... am I...?

Gavial:
Morning, Kemar.

Flint:
Gavial?! What are you doing here?

Gavial:
You bumped into my friend, fought her, and lost.

Blaze:
Heh, welcome back, kid.

Flint:
......

Blaze:
Hey, Gavial. What's she doing? What's with this bowing? !

Gavial:
Kemar, what gives?

Flint:
I felt a greater strength from her than anything I ever felt from Zumama.

Flint:
I'm not interested in you anymore, Gavial. Looks like you can talk to her, so please, ask her to teach me.

Gavial:
Oh, she wants you to teach her.

Blaze:
What?!

Gavial:
I guess she thinks you're strong, so she wants to become your disciple or something.

Blaze:
...Doctor, what do I do?! I've never been in a situation like this before!

Blaze:
Ugh, how about we just let her follow us for now?

Gavial:
Sure. Hey, Kemar, come with us.

Flint:
Okay.

Flint:
But call me Flint.

Blaze:
Come to think of it, what happened to the ceremony?

Gavial:
Doctor, why don't you explain it to Blaze?

Blaze:
She'll let her people get Oripathy just to build her machines?

Blaze:
I won't stand by and let that happen.

Blaze:
What are we waiting for, Doctor? Let's go!

Utage:
Wait, we still got somewhere to be!

Blaze:
Huh?
