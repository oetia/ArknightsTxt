Gavial:
Doctor, I took a quick stroll around. Didn't seem like there were any others.

Gavial:
Looks like we're gonna have to head back into the rainforest to look for her bunch after this.

Peta:
——! (Cry of victory)

Tomimi:
Oh, Peta won.

Gavial:
This Peta's pretty good. Makes me wanna rumble with him, actually.

Tomimi:
Mm-hm! He's one of my tribe's warriors.

Tomimi:
But he's definitely not as good as you, Gavial.

Gavial:
Haha, easy enough to say.

Tomimi:
Come on, Gavial! You already came so close to becoming Great Chief over when we were little!  Like you could lose to Peta!

Gavial:
Hmm? Oh, yeah, that one time.

Gavial:
I was super young. Thought the idea was so cool, I actually went in for the ceremony once.

Tomimi:
Yeah, and you were already so super strong by then!

Archosauria Warrior:
Gah...

Archosauria Champion:
So that's all you Wilderness's Wills amount to!

Tomimi:
S-Strong...

Archosauria A:
Pfeh. All our warriors taken down like nothing.

Archosauria B:
Let's go in together!

Archosauria A:
We can't. No number at once will be enough... Can we only give up...?

Archosauria Champion:
Who else wants to challenge me?! If you're all done, then it's just me versus the Great Chief!

Gavial:
I do!

Archosauria Champion:
And you're... Wilderness's Will's orphan, Gavial?

Archosauria Champion:
I hear you're a terror among the kids, but kids don't join the ceremony. Run back home and drink your milk. You've got a few more years.

Gavial:
Hmph! Let's see who wins first!

Archosauria Champion:
Hah! You really are an orphan. You don't fear death?!

Gavial:
My tribespeople are my family! Cut the crap! Do you wanna go or not?!

Archosauria Champion:
Heh! It's your funeral, brat!

Archosauria Champion:
Im... Impossible... Just two punches...

Tomimi:
Gavial's... so strong...

Gavial:
Hmph! I guess that's all, then!

Gavial:
Who else wants some?

Tomimi:
Didn't she ever tell you?

Gavial:
Didn't I?

Gavial:
Eh. I guess I didn't, but it's not like it was important enough to come up.

Gavial:
Dunno who my parents were, but that's not all that rare in these parts.

Gavial:
Doctor, it may not make sense to you, but death is pretty common out here.

Gavial:
It doesn't even take a Catastrophe—honestly, nobody here knows what Catastrophes are—a single cold or a bout of bad weather can kill off folks who would've lived otherwise.

Gavial:
I'd guess my parents just went like that.

Gavial:
Eugh. Let's quit this talk. All you need to know is the tribe raised me.

Tomimi:
Gavial...

Gavial:
You can quit it, Doctor. I don't really need the pity treatment.

Gavial:
I'm not the only orphan ever. Plenty of families around here that link up and raise a bunch of 'em together. It happens all the time.

Gavial:
Doctor, don't overthink it.

Gavial:
I didn't even know it was unusual until I left.

Gavial:
Actually, I guess you could say it's what made me decide to do medicine.

Gavial:
Haha. Yeah.

Gavial:
That one, uh...

???:
Found you, you goshdarned bounty hunter!

Peta:
Who's that?!

Gavial:
Huh? I know that voice...

Ceobe:
Give the Doctor back!

Peta:
What the hell are you talking about?

Gavial:
Kay?!

Gavial:
Tomimi, didn't we tell your people to tie her up and take her back to the tribe?

Tomimi:
Um, I thought we did?

Gavial:
She's real strong. Kid must've just plowed past everyone...

Ceobe:
Bounty hunter! Hand the Doctor over!

Ceobe:
Or else I'm gonna chase you to the end of the world, if I hafta!

Gavial:
Tch. Smartest girl ever. Looks like she still hasn't even sobered up.

Peta:
Gahhh!

Tomimi:
She sent Peta flying!

Archosauria A:
She finished Peta off!

Archosauria B:
She's insanely strong...

Archosauria C:
Where'd that weirdo come from?! Which tribe is she?!

Archosauria A:
No idea! I don't even understand what she's saying!

Archosauria B:
Forget it! All we gotta do is beat her, right?

Gavial:
Oh, damn it. Now they think Kay's the new challenger, don't they?

Tomimi:
Gavial, should we go in and help?

Gavial:
No, wait. The dumb little kid is way tougher than you'd think. She can handle this. If we go in, we're just gonna add to the body count.

Gavial:
But something tells me this might get messy. Doctor, see if you can help Tomimi's lackeys get this under control.
