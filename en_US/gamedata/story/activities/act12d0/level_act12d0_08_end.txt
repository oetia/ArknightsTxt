High Priest:
Waaaaahhhh! Ugh, hold on. I should do a different cry next time, I'm getting rather tired of this one...

Gavial:
Hey, is he alright?

Eunectes:
No need to worry, he'll be back in a minute.

Gavial:
Okay... is he like... a person? I've never heard of anyone like him before.

Eunectes:
No idea, the High Priest only told me he's lived here for a very long time.

Gavial:
Alright then. What else can we say...

Gavial:
Phew, he's really something...

Blaze:
Gavial, your head is bleeding. Are you okay?

Gavial:
It's fine, just a scratch. Tomimi, bring me my medical bag here.

Gavial:
Hm? Where did Tomimi go?

Utage:
Here's your bag. And Tomimi, I think I saw her running off somewhere right before we won the fight.

Gavial:
Thanks. She didn't get scared, did she? Anyway, let's patch ourselves up first.

Gavial:
You go check if anyone's injured, and bring them to me if they are. I'll take care of them.

Ceobe:
Leave it to me!

Blaze:
Haha, no problem.

Utage:
Ugh, what a pain. Fine.

Croissant:
Quit yer belly-achin'.

Gavial:
Doctor... hmm?

Eunectes:
The Big Ugly...

Gavial:
Sorry, Zumama. We had to take it apart.

Eunectes:
I know.

Eunectes:
I checked your engine, I think it's working fine. You can have it back.

Gavial:
Oh yeah? That's great!

Eunectes:
You really won't stay, Gavial?

Gavial:
Yeah, just like you, I've found my calling.

Eunectes:
To be a doctor?

Gavial:
That's it.

Eunectes:
Is doctoring fun?

Gavial:
Is building machines fun?

Eunectes:
It is.

Gavial:
Same here.

Eunectes:
But you still have to be the Great Chief.

Gavial:
Huh?

Eunectes:
Any way you slice it, you beat the Big, Ugly Thing. You won, Gavial.

Eunectes:
Look, everyone's here again. They're looking to you.

Gavial:
Tch. Doctor, what do we do?

Gavial:
You're not giving me anything here!

Gavial:
Doctor, I know you're awake! I'm a doctor!

Gavial:
Tch. Doctor, I really want to punch you right now.

Tomimi:
Gavial, are you hurt?!

Gavial:
Hm? I'm fine. Where did you run off to?

Tomimi:
Huh? Oh, that... I had to go pee!

Gavial:
Okay... Hm?

Tomimi:
What's wrong, Gavial? Why are you looking at me like that?

Gavial:
Hm... Haha, I've got it!

Gavial:
Everyone, listen up!

Gavial:
I beat the Big Ugly, so I'm going to be the Great Chief.

Gavial:
And so, my message to you is——

Gavial:
Your fists are everything!

Tomimi:
Eh? Gavial, are you staying here to be the Great Chief?

Gavial:
But!

Gavial:
I have something very important I must do, so I have to leave.

Gavial:
Worry not, though! When I'm gone, Tomimi will give orders on my behalf!

Gavial:
Just treat Tomimi as you would treat me!

Tomimi:
Eh, w-w-what?

Utage:
Is that really gonna fly? Don't these people worship strength over everything?

Eunectes:
Gavial is the Great Chief after all. She defeated everyone, so her word is law.

Gavial:
Haha. Zumama, machines are pretty cool, but I think I'll stick with my fists after all.

Eunectes:
Hmph. Don't forget, I still don't recognize you. I'll build an even greater machine and challenge you again.

Gavial:
Sure, I'll be waiting.

Gavial:
Oh, right. Before that, you need to come with me for a bit.

Eunectes:
Why?

Gavial:
You need to come with me to Rhodes Island to get an Oripathy checkup.

Eunectes:
Can I refuse? I still have to work on the Big Ugly...

Gavial:
You don't have a choice this time. Besides, until Tomimi takes over, I'm still the Great Chief. I'll bring you back even if I have to kidnap you.

Eunectes:
Fine.

Tomimi:
...Gavial, are you going to leave after all?

Gavial:
Yep, I'll probably be leaving right as soon as we get the engine back in the aircraft.

Tomimi:
......

Tomimi:
No.

Gavial:
Hm?

Tomimi:
I-I won't let you leave!
