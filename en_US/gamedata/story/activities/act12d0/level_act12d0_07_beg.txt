High Priest:
Wahhhhhhh!!!

Archosauria A:
Tch, another failure. He's flying in a nice arc this time though.

Archosauria B:
Where did he land?

Archosauria A:
No idea. He'll come running back after a while anyway. Let's keep going.

Archosauria A:
Okay, what does this tube connect to——

Archosauria A:
Haha, this looks like a good port, I'm plugging it in!

Archosauria A:
Hey, is it working?

Archosauria B:
No. Do you even know what you're doing?!

Archosauria A:
What are you yelling for? I've never seen an engine like this before, just let me experiment a bit!

Archosauria B:
I want to try!

Archosauria B:
I think this tube goes here. What does this button do then? Who cares, just press it.

Archosauria A:
You're the one who's messing around! It obviously goes here!

Archosauria C:
What are you two idiots doing? The gas pipe isn't even connected. Let me do it!

Archosauria C:
Hmm, what does the gas pipe go to... Never mind, this port looks bigger, this is probably it!

Archosauria C:
Hey, somebody try to start it!

High Priest:
I'm back!

High Priest:
Youngsters nowadays really have no respect for their elders. No one bothered to look for me after I got blasted away!

Archosauria A:
But, High Priest, you always come back safe. Everyone's gotten used to it!

Archosauria B:
Stop wasting time, let's get on with the testing!

High Priest:
Yeah, yeah, alright.

The Big, Ugly Thing:
————!

High Priest:
Big Ugly, my child, it's time to wake up!

Archosauria A:
Ohh! Great Chief, it's moving!

Archosauria B:
This wonderful engine sound! I've never heard anything so amazing!

Archosauria C:
Haha, told you I'd get it done!

Eunectes:
How did you do it?

Archosauria A:
Just as you saw, Great Chief, it moved just like that!

Archosauria B:
We plugged this tube here and that one there!

Archosauria C:
Just like how we built the Big Ugly!

Eunectes:
Good.

High Priest:
Ahh, the Big Ugly, once but a pile of scrap metal, is now truly majestic. I'm so moved. It makes me want to sing!

Eunectes:
But you're bad at singing.

High Priest:
I'm sorry?! Fine. I think I have a real talent for singing though... Terrible!

High Priest:
Oh? Maybe it's a style problem.

High Priest:
Yes, that's right. That has to be the reason. Next time, I'll try singing in bel canto!

Archosauria:
Great Chief, someone broke in!

Eunectes:
Is it Gavial? I...

Archosauria:
No! It's a weirdo carrying a pile of weapons!

Eunectes:
What?

Tomimi:
Zumama's tribe should be right ahead.

Gavial:
Damn, look what she's done to her own tribe.

Blaze:
It looks pretty cool!

Tomimi:
Eh? It seems pretty lively inside.

Gavial:
Huh? Why are they fighting?

Ceobe:
Damn Reunion, you're trying to steal Kay's name now! That's something even more precious than honey biscuits! You'll pay for this!

Archosauria A:
Gaaaaaaaah!

Archosauria B:
Where did this weirdo come from? She's too strong!

Archosauria C:
I can't understand what she's saying. What the hell's a Reunion?!

Utage:
Eh, isn't that Kay?

Tomimi:
Yes.

Blaze:
Sounds like Kay's making a ruckus in there.

Gavial:
Let's calm her down first!
