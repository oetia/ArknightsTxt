Archosauria A:
This weirdo's way too strong! She's beaten back so many of us already!

Archosauria B:
I still don't get what she's saying, but she's no joke!

Archosauria C:
I reckon she'd make a fine Great Chief!

Tomimi:
...Gavial, your friend's really strong.

Gavial:
She sure is a pain in the ass at times like this though.

Gavial:
I think we finally hit a lull. I'm gonna go up there and restrain her...

Ceobe:
You, Reunion! You're back!

Ceobe:
So you were the ones who took the Doctor!

Ceobe:
You won't get away!

Gavial:
Oh, you dumb... She's gonna escape again!

Gavial:
I'm going after her! Tomimi, you and the Doctor stay put! I'll come back and find you!

Tomimi:
Uh, okay!

Tomimi:
......

Tomimi:
Oh, there's another fight starting.

Tomimi:
...Doctor, could you tell me what Gavial is like on the outside?

Tomimi:
Is Gavial having a good life out there, then?

Tomimi:
......

Tomimi:
Maybe you don't know Gavial that well?

Tomimi:
That's great! ...Um, no, I was just thinking since Gavial came back with you, and she seemed to really like you, and it looks like you get along really well.

Tomimi:
But that's okay! Gavial's a really nice person! I think you can definitely get along with her!

Tomimi:
That's great! Even if she's a doctor, Gavial's still Gavial!

Tomimi:
That's good to know. Gavial hasn't changed. What a relief...

Tomimi:
So if Gavial decided to leave you one day, how would you feel?

Tomimi:
Mmm. I cried a lot when it happened, too...

Tomimi:
How... How could you be like that?! Gavial's such a good person! How could you care so little if she left?!

Tomimi:
You're incredible... I couldn't do that.

Tomimi:
I always hoped Gavial would come back.

Tomimi:
Doctor, um, about Gavial...! I-I'm not gonna let you take her from me!

Tomimi:
Um, that one...

Gavial:
Oh, what? You call me a kid, and this is all you've got?

Gavial:
Who else is gonna challenge me?!

Archosauria A:
She beat a lot of fighters more experienced than her...

Archosauria B:
Gavial, you rule!

Archosauria C:
It's wild to say, but could she be the next Great Chief?

???:
I'll take you on!

Gavial:
Oh, what the hell are you doing here, Zumama?

Gavial:
Weren't you busy building your machines? Every time I went looking for you, you ignored me.

Zumama:
...I decided to come and see, in the end.

Gavial:
See what?

Zumama:
See if my fists could beat you or not.

Gavial:
You say that like you wanna get killed dead.

Zumama:
Enough talk. I'm not losing to you today, Gavial.

Gavial:
Hey, you won't know until you've tried!

Tomimi:
They fought from noon until night without settling anything. No winner, no loser.

Tomimi:
They went until they'd used all their strength, and afterwards, both of them got dragged off by the others.

Tomimi:
That's the story of the first time Gavial joined the ceremony.

Tomimi:
Zumama was someone from a different tribe, but she was fairly close.

Tomimi:
Back when they were young, she and Gavial fought a lot. Gavial was stronger than her, but it wasn't like Zumama never won.

Tomimi:
But then Gavial said Zumama just stopped caring about fighting for some reason. She started researching machines instead.

Tomimi:
And I remember that day was the last time Zumama and Gavial ever fought.

Tomimi:
After that, Zumama barely even showed her face anywhere. Eventually, her tribe moved away, and I never saw her again.

Tomimi:
Not even at that final mess of a ceremony before Gavial left. She never came.

Gavial:
I'm back.

Tomimi:
Gavial! You're okay, right?

Gavial:
I'm fine. Tch. Kay's got a hell of a pair of legs. Just ran off and disappeared out of sight.

Gavial:
But knowing how well she can fend for herself, I'm not worried. Tomimi, did Zumama get here yet?

Tomimi:
Not yet.

Archosauria:
Who else will challenge me?!

???:
I will.

Gavial:
Hmm? Looks like I came back at just the right time.
