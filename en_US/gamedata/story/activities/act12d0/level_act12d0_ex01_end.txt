Dan:
The scorching sun, the wilds, the golden sand, and the warm breeze! Woohoo! I feel a new song coming on!

Frost:
（solo）

Aya:
Could the both of you quiet down?

Alty:
Please. It's not often we get such a peaceful environment with no one chasing us. Can't we just have a nice, quiet rest?

Aya:
But Alty, I can smell the sea from here. Are you sure we're safe?

Alty:
Aya, could you not spoil the mood for once?

Alty:
Nowhere in the world is truly safe, but we have to learn to let ourselves relax sometimes.

Aya:
Maybe you're right.

Aya:
So what's the next step? How are we going to broaden our path? We can't go back empty-handed.

Alty:
At least that doctor gave us an answer this time.

Alty looks at the 'key' in her hand.

Dan:
Really? That looks like something special. And she just gave it to you? What did you trade for it?

Alty:
Knowledge.

Dan:
And was that a fair trade?

Alty:
I'm not sure. But I think that doctor wants us to put this knowledge to use.

Aya:
Wouldn't she know?

Alty:
We know a lot, she should just...

Alty:
...If you think about it, the real trade was her using our curiosity to get us to act.

Dan:
So, that means she didn't pay anything?

Aya:
Hm...

Alty:
Hm...

Aya:
We've been cheated.

Alty:
More like baited.

Dan:
Directed?

Frost:
Guided.

Aya:
Is that doctor really so important?

Alty:
No. I think she's trying to tell us that her actions have no impact at all.

Alty:
What matters is what we think and what we do.

Aya:
Then what about the key? Should we go?

Dan:
Ugh, this sucks. Could we not go?

Alty:
I'm thinking it's sort of like music... Our power should not be to force change onto others, we should just be singing our own songs.

Aya:
Sing for them. If it sounds good—

Dan:
Then they'll sing too.

Frost:
（solo）

Alty:
Hah, then we will give even more knowledge, and the key, over to the one who is ready.

Aya:
And who will that be?

Alty:
I don't know.

Aya:
Maybe they haven't been born yet.

Dan:
That would be great!

Alty:
No it wouldn't, Dan. We... hm?

Aya:
What is it, Alty?

Alty:
The car's dead.

Aya:
Didn't you prep it?

Alty:
Yes, but we took that detour.

Alty:
And I have to admit, it's really easy to lose your heading in the middle of the wilderness with no roads or signs.

Aya:
So basically, we're lost?

Alty:
I'm not sure that's how I'd put it. It's not so much that we're off course as it is we're carving a new path.

Frost:
We're lost.

Dan:
We're lost! That's a pretty good theme.

Aya:
You know, Dan, I really wish I could learn some of your optimism. So what are we going to do?

Alty:
It looks like there's a rainforest over that way. Let's check it out.

Aya:
So, who's getting out to push?

Alty:
We could take turns.

Aya:
Alty。

Alty:
What?

Aya:
We've got a crowd here.

Alty:
Yes, we do.

Alty:
But I don't know what language they're speaking.

Aya:
So should we just let them follow us?

Alty:
Do you have a better idea?

Aya:
We could kill them all?

Alty:
You think you can get Frost and Dan to go along with that?

Frost:
(Strumming and singing)

Archosauria A:
&*......%$ ....& (W-What is this sound? And why do I like it so much? !)

Archosauria B:
&%......% (I've never heard anything like it...)

Dan:
Hey, how is everybody?!

Dan:
Can you tell me what language you're speaking?!

Dan:
Oh, but I guess even if you told me, I still wouldn't know.

Archosauria C:
......%&$ (Where did they come from?!)

Archosauria D:
$......&# (And why does this one look so weird? )

Aya:
Well, at least there are people here.

Alty:
I just hope there's a place we can resupply.

Aya:
Wishful thinking.

Eunectes:
You're outsiders?

Alty:
Huh? You speak Sargonian?

Eunectes:
Yes, it looks like you're definitely outsiders.

Eunectes:
What are you doing here?

Alty:
Our car died, so we're looking for someone with the Arts to recharge it.

Eunectes:
...Come with me.

Alty:
See, Aya, that was more than just wishful thinking.

Aya:
Fine. I guess the world is a magical place.

Dan:
Hey hey hey! What's this?!

Dan:
There's a village here in the middle of this primeval forest!

Frost:
(Humming)

Aya:
It's really amazing. You can see the influence of modern architecture on most of the buildings, but they still have that primitive beauty.

Alty:
It's odd, but very special.

Eunectes:
I am the leader of this tribe, Zumama. Most of my people can understand your language.

Eunectes:
I can have some of our priests recharge your vehicle, but there are terms.

Alty:
What terms?

Eunectes:
I want to look inside your vehicle, at its structure.

Alty:
...Is that all?

Eunectes:
Yes.

Aya:
Are you sure you won't break it?

Eunectes:
I'm pretty sure.

Aya:
Alty？

Alty:
It's not like we have a choice.

Eunectes:
So...?

Alty:
Agreed.

Eunectes:
Good.  High Priest...

High Priest:
I'm here! ...Oh?

High Priest:
Hmmmmm....?

High Priest:
I know of you...

Alty:
I know of you...

Alty:
I never expected to see your kind here.

High Priest:
Oh, honestly, I was thinking the exact same thing.

High Priest:
But I'm more interested in your vehicle than you!

Alty:
By all means.

Aya:
I said it before and I'll say it again. The world is a magical place.

Alty:
I have to say, I agree.

At the same time, Frost hooks her guitar up to the ceremonial speaker and improvises a solo.

Alty:
Nice, Frost.

Frost:
This village is inspiring me.

Dan:
Awesome, Frost, you really switched up the melody this time.

Frost:
Heat, repressed...

Frost:
I'll call this song... 'D'!

Archosauria A:
Where's that sound coming from?

Archosauria B:
What is it?I can feel it energizing me!

Archosauria C:
It must be the outsiders who just came! Let's go see!

Aya:
There are more of them, Alty...

Alty:
That's not good.

Frost:
These lives thirst for music! For energy! For...

Archosauria B:
What a voice!

Archosauria C:
Outsider, give us more music!

Aya:
Alty... I know it's unexpected, but I think the atmosphere here is actually really good.

Aya:
Why don't we get out the amps and play together?

Alty:
I guess that would be fine.

Dan:
Yeah, can't let Frost take all the glory!

Dan:
I gotta get in on such a badass track!

Alty:
Then let the locals feel the music of AUS!

Archosauria A:
It's just a few notes, but I'm too excited to sit still!

Archosauria B:
It might be like what the priests do, it's called 'music'?

Archosauria C:
I've never heard anything like it! Who are these people?!

Archosauria D:
I know, they must be 'Cuicayotl'!

Dan:
'Cuicayotl'?  What's that?

High Priest:
Oh, that's how you say 'one who sings' in their language.

High Priest:
But it's been a long time since they had a 'Cuicayotl' here, and you've won them over with your music.

High Priest:
And I must say, your music is vastly different from that of any other 'Cuicayotl' I've ever heard before!

High Priest:
But no matter. I find yours a lot more fun!

Archosauria E:
'Cuicayotl', give us another song!

Archosauria F:
I'll give you anything! Just one more song!

Aya:
What do we do, Alty?

Dan:
Let's stay here, Alty!

Alty:
Well, I can't let you forget our goal...

Alty:
But, fine. We've got time.

Aya:
I never imagined there would be a Messenger here.

Inam:
And I never thought AUS, from all the magazine covers, would show up here either.

Alty:
Where's Zumama?

Inam:
She's making the speaker system you asked for. So I'll be taking you.

Inam:
How long are you going to stay?

Alty:
Maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe a whole year.

Alty:
This place is doing it for us. I think we can have some fun here, at least.

Inam:
Then this is the right place for you to put on a show.

Dan:
So cool!

Alty:
It's... some kind of temple?

Inam:
That's right. This is where all the tribes used to gather for the 'Mahuizzotia', but it hasn't been used since Gavial left.

Aya:
'Mahuizzotia'?

Alty:
Gavial? That name came up at Rhodes Island... No, it's probably just a common name.

Inam:
You can perform here.

Frost:
We're going to give the people the best music they've ever heard.

Dan:
Yes, hahaha! Yes! We'll leave the mark of AUS right here!

Two months later...

Inam:
AUS is unbelievable...

Inam:
They actually did stay for two whole months.

Inam:
If Gavial ever comes back, she's going to be blown away by the music we have way out here now.

Inam:
The people fell in love with their rock and roll.

Inam:
So what are they going to perform for us today?

Inam:
...I wonder maybe if I'm their biggest fan.

Inam:
AUS...

Inam:
Huh?

The room is empty. All the toiletries and bedding are neat and tidy, with a piece of paper resting on the table in the center.

Inam:
They're gone?

Inam:
There's a note on the table. Let's see...

Inam:
'We left. Don't miss us. I hope you enjoyed the music. Also, we left all our records here for you. Have fun.  -AUS'

Inam:
...Heh, they really are unbelievable.

Alty:
I don't think I'll ever forget that Acahualla place.

Frost:
(Humming) It was definitely unforgettable.

Aya:
But the people there are really noisy, and wild.

Dan:
Yeah? I love them!

Aya:
Of course you do. I don't think you'd mind if we left you there.

Dan:
I was definitely thinking about it.

Dan:
Don't you think those people have a kind of natural, primal energy?

Dan:
Out of all the countries and cities we've been to, I've never seen people like that.

Dan:
I love 'em!

Aya:
Well, you're right about that much.

Frost:
They really get our music. They're the best audience we've ever had.

Alty:
I think Frost likes them too.

Alty:
But we can't just show up and flip a whole civilization upside-down. We should stick to singing.

Aya:
Sing for them. If it sounds good—

Dan:
Then they'll sing too.

Aya:
Didn't we say that before?

Alty:
Who knows? We might've said it a million times already.

Alty:
Let's go. Continue on our journey.

Alty:
If we sing to the world, will she listen?

A few of the bandmates joke around for a bit, until the car goes silent.

Alty looks at the key in her hand, 'Dr. Kal'tsit, can that Rhodes Island of yours give the world the answer it's looking for?'
