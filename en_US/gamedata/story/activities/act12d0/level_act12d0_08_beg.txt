Tomimi:
The buildings here are so different from the other tribes...

Ceobe:
Crappy houses!

Utage:
Hm, the architecture and decor is all pretty crude.

Croissant:
Got a lotta weird, broken gizmos all over the place too.

Gavial:
Zumama, you've got a very unique tribe here.

Gavial:
Looks like they enjoy fiddling around with machines just as much as you do.

Eunectes:
This is my people's masterpiece.

Eunectes:
Yes. They now know the charm of the machines, and they have built the tribe you see here on their passion alone.

Archosauria A:
Look, it's Gavial!

Archosauria B:
The Great Chief wasn't lying. She's planning to duel Gavial again with the Big Ugly.

Archosauria C:
What?! No way I can miss that!

Ceobe:
Wow, there's so many people!

Eunectes:
Many of them are from other tribes who've came here after the ceremony. They will be joining us.

Gavial:
So, what did you want to say?

Eunectes:
Gavial, if you just left without a fuss, I wouldn't have cared. But since you're standing before me once again, I will defeat you right here and now.

Gavial:
Why?

Eunectes:
Because you're too strong, Gavial.

Eunectes:
Do you still remember that day?

Gavial:
That day?

Eunectes:
Before that day, I was just like you. I believed the strength in my fists was everything.

Gavial:
Hah!

Eunectes:
Ahhhh!

Old Archosauria:
Gavial wins!

Gavial:
Haha, I win again.

Eunectes:
Hmph, another rematch! I'll definitely win this time!

Gavial:
Sure!

Eunectes:
Eh, why is the ground shaking?

Gavial:
Look over there!

Eunectes:
Wh- what's that?!

Gavial:
It's a big hunk of metal!

Old Archosauria:
That is a Sargon nomadic city...

Eunectes:
What's a Sargon?

Old Archosauria:
Sargon is our country.

Eunectes:
Then what's a nomadic city?

Old Archosauria:
A nomadic city is a very large tribe, with many people living in it.

Old Archosauria:
I visited once, when I was young.

Old Archosauria:
Don't be afraid. It won't come over here.

Old Archosauria:
It will never have anything to do with us.

Eunectes:
......

Gavial:
Zumama, what is it? Are you feeling sick?

Eunectes:
No. I'm going home.

Gavial:
Oh, I remember. A Sargon nomadic city was passing pretty close to us that day. You turned all weird after that.

Eunectes:
I think you're the weird one, Gavial.

Eunectes:
How could you not feel astonished after seeing something like that? How could you not be shocked? How could you not feel like a tiny speck of dust?

Gavial:
I mean, I guess I felt something like 'Wow, that's big.' But what's a big thing got to do with me?

Eunectes:
That's our Gavial.

Eunectes:
But that's the day I lost interest in fighting with you.

Eunectes:
I asked Inam to help me find books on machinery, and began studying Sargonian and mechanical engineering.

Eunectes:
Then I met the High Priest, and we began building the Big, Ugly Thing together.

Gavial:
I know. I did go to look for you after all.

Gavial:
Hm? Does that mean that the weirdo over there is your invisible friend?

High Priest:
That's right!

Utage:
Woah! When did you get here?!

Croissant:
This feller's got the same energy as my Baws, the Emperor...

High Priest:
Emperor? Are you talking about that penguin?

Croissant:
Sure am. Hold on a minute, you know the Baws?

High Priest:
Of course, of course I do. Though it's been a couple of decades since we last met... Eh, was it a few decades? Or a few centuries?  Doesn't matter. I can smell him on you.

Utage:
What's that about a few centuries...?

Croissant:
Lordy loo! Who'da thunk I'd meet a friend of the Baws out here!

Gavial:
So you really do exist. I always thought Zumama got messed up in the head and hallucinated you. I was even researching similar cases at Rhodes Island.

High Priest:
Oh, don't you know, Gavial? Whenever you came to look for Zumama, I was always there watching!

High Priest:
Just like this!

Gavial:
He disappeared!

High Priest:
Hahaha, I wouldn't normally show myself to you, but since I want to pilot the Big Ugly, I have no choice!

High Priest:
Building machines with the little ones is actually a lot of fun!

Utage:
Speaking of the Big Ugly, shouldn't somebody be driving it?  'cause I'm pretty sure it's about to crash into that house.

High Priest:
Huh? Oh, crap! Gotta go!

Utage:
Wow, he popped back into that thing quick. Badass.

Croissant:
He'n the Boss really are birds of a feather, huh...

Eunectes:
......

Gavial:
Oh, right, our conversation. Zumama, let's get to the point, if we're gonna fight anyway do we really have to talk about all this stuff?

Eunectes:
Yes.

Eunectes:
I have things to say to you, and to myself.

Eunectes:
Did you know, Gavial? You were always my biggest obstacle.

Gavial:
Huh? Really?

Eunectes:
Well, not just you, but people like you.

Eunectes:
I've tried so many times to teach people about the charm of the machines. But in the end, they're never interested.

Eunectes:
Because they look up to strong people, like you.

Eunectes:
You teach them that, in this place, you get what you want when you're strong.

Eunectes:
It's your strength that stands in the way of progress.

Eunectes:
So I decided to change the way they think. I'm going to use an even greater power to destroy this blind worship of strength that you created.

Utage:
Well, that makes sense to me. What do you think, Doctor?

Gavial:
Doctor, whose side are you on?!

Croissant:
Sounds like yer talkin' sense, but it still don't feel right, somehow...

Blaze:
Hell yeah! That big clanker's badass!

Gavial:
Honestly, I'm almost convinced myself.

Gavial:
But I never wanted to be anyone's role model. When I say fists solve problems, that's just me talking. It's got nothing to do with anyone else.

Eunectes:
I know, I'm not blaming you.

Eunectes:
Even so, Gavial, I want to defeat you with the power of the Big Ugly.

Eunectes:
Everyone, listen up!

Eunectes:
The Big Ugly will be dueling Gavial once again!

Eunectes:
This battle will decide who is the real Great Chief!

Eunectes:
High Priest, it's time to fight!

High Priest:
You got it!

Eunectes:
Are you ready, Gavial? Your friends can join the fight too!

Gavial:
Finally!

Gavial:
Step back, everybody. This one's mine.

Gavial:
Come at me!

High Priest:
Let's test its performance first!

High Priest:
Fire!

Gavial:
Heh, don't think you'll hit me a second time!

High Priest:
Ah, those are the reflexes I'd expect from Gavial! No problem. Have a taste of my great iron fist!

Gavial:
A test of strength, huh? Sounds good to me!

Ceobe:
Wow, Gavial's strong!

Croissant:
Crazy strong! She stopped its fist all by lonesome!

Utage:
I know I asked way back when I got my first physical, but why is she a medic again?

High Priest:
...You may be my opponent, but I can't help but cheer for you!

High Priest:
It's not over yet though! The Big Ugly has a max performance mode for just such an occasion!

High Priest:
Go!

Gavial:
What?!

Utage:
That big guy looks stronger!

Blaze:
And it's suppressing Gavial's strength?!

High Priest:
Oh, what a melodious sound...! Hm? Wait, these readings are strange... Whaaa?

Eunectes:
High Priest, what's going on?!

High Priest:
Waah, my butt's being cooked!

Eunectes:
I'm talking about the Big Ugly!

High Priest:
Oh, I was just sharing my status as well. I think the engine output is too high. I'm losing control of the Big Ugly!

High Priest:
It's actually quite exhilarating!

Eunectes:
Get out of there!

High Priest:
Aren't we fighting? Let's just fight like this! Come, Gavial, I'll finish this once and for all——

Eunectes:
High Priest!

High Priest:
Oh, fine. What a shame. Looks like I'll have to change tactics.

High Priest:
Zumama, don't worry about me, I'll do my best to stabilize it. You find a way to stop the Big Ugly in the meantime!

Eunectes:
...Gavial, you and your people get out of here. This isn't your business.

Gavial:
What are you talking about? Don't you want to beat me?

Eunectes:
I do. But not like this.

Gavial:
Come on. Of course I'm going to help. Right, Doctor?

Ceobe:
Fight the monster! I'll help!

Utage:
Eh, you want me to fight that big guy? Really? What a pain.

Croissant:
I'm gettin' overtime for this one, Baws! Triple rate!

Blaze:
Doctor, don't just sit there and enjoy the show! It's time to take command.

Gavial:
You are kind of a pain sometimes, Doctor.

Gavial:
Go and prepare to take command!
