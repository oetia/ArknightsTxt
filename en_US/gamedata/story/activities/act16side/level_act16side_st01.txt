Wasting Man:
She'll be back soon.

Quiet Woman:
The Legati spent so long preparing for this meeting. Of course she will.

Quiet Woman:
How long will you stay?

Wasting Man:
Until I finish what I must do.

Wasting Man:
For all I can accomplish here is the delivery of the Lateran people's souls.

Wasting Man:
......

Wasting Man:
I should go.

Quiet Woman:
Don't come back.

Cecelia:
Mamma, drink some hot water.

Sickly Mother:
Good girl, *cough* *cough*... Mamma's alright.

Cecelia:
Mamma... I'll read you a storybook.

Sickly Mother:
Cecelia, my darling Cecelia.

Sickly Mother:
Mamma really hates to leave you.

Cecelia:
Are you going to leave me, Mamma?

Sickly Mother:
No, *cough* *cough*... Mamma's never, ever wanted... to leave you...

Sickly Mother:
She's just got no choice...

Cecelia:
Where are you going, Mamma? Can I go with you too? Is that okay?

Sickly Mother:
You can't go where I'm about to go, Cecelia... It's very cold, very lonely, and so, so empty.

Cecelia:
I'll go with you, I'll be with you so you won't be lonely.

Sickly Mother:
...I'm sorry, Cecelia.

Sickly Mother:
Your childhood should have been so much more blessed...

Cecelia:
I HAVE been blessed. With you, Mamma.

Sickly Mother:
Cecelia... Cecelia. Listen now, listen.

Cecelia:
I'm listening, Mamma.

Sickly Mother:
I won't be able to look after you soon... Someone will come pick you up.

Sickly Mother:
Go with him. He'll take you to Papà.

Sickly Mother:
Papà will look after you for me, okay?

Cecelia:
Can't you come with me? I bet Papà really wants to see you...

Sickly Mother:
Mamma... has something important to do... So I can't go with you.

Sickly Mother:
Once you see Papà, tell him that your Mamma really misses him too.

Sickly Mother:
Also, tell him... I'm sorry. Okay?

Cecelia:
Mamma, what are you sorry for?

Sickly Mother:
Listen to me, listen to your Mamma, Cecelia!

Cecelia:
I will, Mamma... Don't cry...

Sickly Mother:
Cecelia, my poor Cecelia... Giving birth to you was the greatest blessing in my life. But what if you find it a lifelong curse... my child, my beloved daughter...

Sickly Mother:
Who will bless you? Who can?

Sickly Mother:
Cecelia, my darling Cecelia... Hide yourself. Don't let them find you...

Sickly Mother:
Run away... leave Laterano...

The mother holds her daughter's hands. Through her eyes flash myriad emotions, until finally all strength fades from them.

And they slowly, gently fall shut.

Cecelia:
Mamma...?

The Sankta girl does not know what's happened.

When she notices her mother's hands have turned cold, she clasps them together against her own chest, hoping to provide some warmth to her.

There's a knock on the door.

???:
Executor Federico of the Laterano Notarial Hall, on official business. Please open the door.

Cheery Legatus:
Sir, your check-in at the guesthouse has been taken care of.

Cheery Legatus:
The rest of your day is completely free! Might not be a bad idea to have a look around. You seemed quite eager the whole way.

Columbian Magnate:
Hmm—

Columbian Magnate:
Lateran City has some very distinct architecture.

Cheery Legatus:
You see? Wasn't it worth the trip?

Columbian Magnate:
I suppose it was.

Columbian Magnate:
What's the schedule for tomorrow?

Cheery Legatus:
Your meeting with His Holiness the Apostle, our Pope, is all set, so I'll be returning to the Basilica now. I'll fetch you tomorrow when it's time to meet him.

Cheery Legatus:
Please enjoy your stay in Laterano during the conference. No need to worry about expenses; it is our honor to host VIPs from the world over.

Columbian Magnate:
The world over... *sigh* I sure don't see how gathering all these foreigners in one place is gonna get anything done.

Columbian Magnate:
Still, how could I refuse such a generous invitation from His Holiness? Might as well take advantage of his hospitality while I'm here.

Cheery Legatus:
Excellent, now if you'll excuse me. Feel free to take Laterano by storm.

Columbian Magnate:
The architecture here sure is interesting. Columbia uses pillars like these too, but there're subtle differences...

Columbian Magnate:
Hmm. Seeing as I'm here...

Columbian Magnate:
Hm? What are they up to over there?

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
All set up?

Sedate Lateran Citizen:
I'm good. How's your end?

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
Done. Ezell, have we dispersed everyone in the area?

Ezell:
All the citizens likely to be directly affected, yes. Those in the secondary effect range are confirmed to be notified as well.

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
Shall we get started then?

Ezell:
Mm-hm... Current time is 10:22, on March 15th, 1099. The following act of demolition is carried out with Reserve Executor Ezell of the Notarial Hall as witness.

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
Alright. Here goes, three—

Columbian Magnate:
(What're those three Sankta doing standing around that pillar?)

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
Two—

Columbian Magnate:
You three are the only ones around here. What gives?

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
One, fire!—Huh, where'd you come from?!

Ezell:
?!

Columbian Magnate:
What?! What was that explosion?! ...Something's coming down!

Columbian Magnate:
Save me, save me! Eeeek—!

Ezell:
!

Ezell:
I have to... what? The pillar's falling a lot slower now...

Columbian Magnate:
Save—

???:
Cram it.

Columbian Magnate:
Eeek—

Columbian Magnate:
Huff... huff...

Columbian Magnate:
Th-That scared the skin off of me! What kind of crazy place is Laterano?! Whoever you are, Liberi, thank you for rescuing me.

Columbian Magnate:
What's your name? Find me at the Columbian Provisional Association, and I'll return the favor.

Mostima:
She's called Shimmering Vigil.

Shimmering Vigil:
......

Columbian Magnate:
Shimmering Vigil...? Lateran names sure do sound silly sometimes...

Shimmering Vigil:
That's not my name.

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
Hi... you're okay, right?!

Sedate Lateran Citizen:
Thanks, you two. That could've been a disaster.

Ezell:
Thank you for your aid.

The Liberi Formerly Known As Shimmering Vigil:
You're welcome.

Columbian Magnate:
Say, what's going on here though? Bombings in the middle of the day? Don't tell me you have extremists sneaking in?

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
Uh...

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
Something's been on my mind.

Sedate Lateran Citizen:
Go on.

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
Do you think this pillar is absolutely perfectly positioned, or no?

Sedate Lateran Citizen:
I would say so; it fully embodies Laterano's architectural aesthetics. So?

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
So... I can't help but wanna see what would happen if we blew it up.

Sedate Lateran Citizen:
Ahh—

Sedate? Lateran Citizen:
I have to admit, it's a fine idea.

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
But the conference is starting soon, right? I heard there'll be a lotta people from afar. I think His Holiness even said we should show some restraint for a while.

Sedate? Lateran Citizen:
He did.

Sedate?? Lateran Citizen:
However, he said 'show some restraint', not 'don't do anything'.

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
I get that His Holiness is hoping to give the visitors a good impression. But, my dear friend, what do you say to my humblest of opinions? I think a 'good impression' must be based on reality.

Not Very Sedate Lateran Citizen:
You couldn't be more correct, my friend.

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
So, we filed with the Notarial Hall, got our executor here to witness for us, and evacuated everyone nearby...

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
Before giving this beautiful pillar just the perfect blast...

Sedate Lateran Citizen:
Except, we never expected you to show up right at that moment.

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
We're so sorry, esteemed sir, for unwittingly doing you harm.

Columbian Magnate:
You... set off an explosion on a nomadic city street? And filed with the government... for an official witness?! Were you... you Laterans always this... uninhibited?

The Liberi Formerly Known As Shimmering Vigil:
Of course we abide by the Commandments and all relevant regulations.

The Liberi Formerly Known As Shimmering Vigil:
But if it's not explicitly forbidden, anything's fair game. And Lateran City values and protects every citizen's rights.

Ezell:
Don't worry, sir. Just your average everyday explosion, perfectly normal.

Columbian Magnate:
What if someone gets hurt...?

Ezell:
We know our limits. That said, I'd also like to extend my apologies to you for this accident.

Sedate Lateran Citizen:
Truly sorry, sir.

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
Maybe it hasn't quite sunk in for you yet, but believe me, stay long enough and you'll learn to love this city.

Columbian Magnate:
Er... I think I can live without that sinking in.

Mostima:
And there you have it.

Mostima:
Welcome to Laterano, sir.

???:
Tut-tut, if it isn't Mostima. Just what is her ability? Is she slowing down time, or merely tricking people into perceiving it that way?

???:
It blows my mind every time.

Reserved Legatus:
Oren, what's going on over there?

Oren:
Not much, just a normal day in my lovely hometown.

Oren:
Though I did get a better show than expected.

Reserved Legatus:
The others are waiting for us.

Oren:
I know. Let's go.

The Legati.

A special Messenger division established under the auspices of the incumbent Pope.

Laterano had previously held a detached position, maintaining neutrality among the central powers.

As such, Lateran officials were sometimes tasked by foreign powers with relaying critical information between different parties in the course of diplomacy.

This role was normalized and institutionalized with the establishment of the Legatus system. They have become a special force moving between the nations.

With Laterano's absolute neutrality as a foundation, the Legati aim to promote the circulation of important information between countries.

1098: via the Legati, the Pope sends an invitation to all nations of Terra:

'Gather for a conference at Laterano. I invite every nation to dispatch its envoys for a discussion regarding our collective security.'

1099: the Legatus system celebrates its thirtieth anniversary.

In March of that year, Legati from all across Terra proceed for Laterano together with the envoys of numerous nations.

Ezell:
One of those two just now seemed a lot like a Pontifica Cohors, and the other... was that a Legatus?

Ezell:
A strange combination.

Brisk Lateran Citizen:
Ezell, are you gonna stick around now that your witness work's done?

Sedate Lateran Citizen:
Don't worry, we'll rebuild the pillar as good as new, just like we wrote in our application.

Ezell:
Good, I'll leave you to it then. I'll be going now, I've still got quite a bit on my plate.

Ezell:
Er. Just to confirm, I'm looking for a will registered by someone who's... passed away?

Federico:
......

A typical single woman's residence, with no trace of any other occupants.

In the bedroom, her body lies serenely. No signs of poisoning, no signs of violence.

Federico:
Federico here.

Federico:
Female citizen's body discovered at 7-265 Via Thervatius, Pagus Stevonus.

Federico:
Preliminary determination of the cause of death: natural. Please notify the Ecclesia Requietum of the pagus to come and inter the remains.

Federico:
Preliminary search found no last will and testament. Please initiate new assignment: confirm deceased's identity, search for will according to any pre-registered information.

Federico:
Federico out.

Cecelia:
Mamma...

Don't go out.

Don't let anyone else find you.

Never, ever approach anyone in uniform.

That's what Mamma said.

Is the uniform man gone? Or still here?

It's alright. When someone visits, just take a nap on your little sofa, just like always. You can go back to Mamma when you wake up.

Don't panic... Cecelia. Why are you so worried?

Why can't you fall asleep?

It's okay, it's okay... you just need to wait for the stranger to leave.

It'll all be alright when you're with Mamma again.

Oren:
Seems things went pretty well in Sargon, huh? They sent out a whole bunch of envoys.

Reluctant Legatus:
Don't get me started. The pashas are all eager enough, but the problem is none of them can agree on anything.

Reluctant Legatus:
I'm already thanking Heaven they haven't started brawling yet.

Oren:
What about Kazimierz? Their military's sizeable, no matter how you slice it.

Calm Legatus:
The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi turned down our proposal, but the K.G.C.C. was actually very interested.

Calm Legatus:
One rep even sought me out.

Calm Legatus:
We had a long chat... he understood the international situation as well as any Legatus.

Calm Legatus:
He might even come in person, if he's not too busy.

Reluctant Legatus:
But enough about us. How about you, Oren?

Oren:
The situation in Victoria is anything but simple these days. I'm sure you've heard a thing or two.

Oren:
Duke Gododdin and I get along fine, but... it's less that he doesn't want to appoint anyone to be here, and more that he CAN'T.

Oren:
Everything's balanced on a knife's edge, more or less.

Reluctant Legatus:
Yan didn't dispatch anyone either. Not that they didn't send a stream of gifts 'conveying our thanks to His Holiness'... How very Yanese of them.

Calm Legatus:
Kjerag actually sent out a few, after rising to prominence these last two years... and every other nation's envoys are already here.

Reluctant Legatus:
To be honest, I never imagined this job would go so smoothly.

Oren:
Scared?

Reluctant Legatus:
A little bit.

Oren:
You haven't been a Legatus for too long, if I remember right.

Reluctant Legatus:
Less than four years, I guess.

Oren:
But our organization has been active for thirty years now.

Oren:
After all our efforts, I'd say every last one of us has earned these results.

Oren:
Besides, we're still a long way off from what we're hoping for—a true 'Summit of Nations', right?

Oren:
We need more than envoys showing up in the Lateran Basilica audience hall. We need the people in power, the ones who can actually change things.

Oren:
So save your nerves for the day we have to greet the big guns instead.

Reluctant Legatus:
Thanks for putting it like that—now I've got no idea if I should be excited or terrified.

Velliv:
I see you can't stop yourself from terrorizing the newbies, Oren.

Oren:
You wound me.

Velliv:
Nothing to get keyed up about, even if that day really comes.

Velliv:
That's what we're qualified for, aren't we?

Oren:
Maybe so.

Velliv:
So, are the acting Legati of each region all present?

Reluctant Legatus:
We're only missing Mostima.

Oren:
Mostima? Ooh, I just happened to see her.

Velliv:
What's she doing?

Oren:
Right now? Taking in her native air again.

Velliv:
Ah, forget her. We were never counting on her to come anyway.

Velliv:
She can report to His Holiness last and we're good, just like always.

Apostolic Knight:
Sanctitas advenit.

In a split second, the hall is silent and still.

All of the Messengers' gazes lie on one spot.

The teacher of all Laterano, their guide, their spiritual leader—

The Pope:
Good morning, children. Have you had breakfast yet?

Pious Sister:
Well?

Stoic Sister:
No sign of external force. It was likely due to illness.

Pious Sister:
A pitiable soul. May she not ail so on the other side.

Stoic Sister:
Dimming Sankta, your remains shall be conferred unto the Ecclesia Requietum, where you shall rest.

Pious Sister:
Here, this was hung on the bedroom wall. Hand it to a member of the Notarial Hall.

Cecelia:
Why did they take Mamma away...?

Cecelia:
What... do I do...?

Cecelia casts her gaze to the entrance.

You can't go out, you can't be found... or else you'll be in danger, Cecelia.

That's what Mamma said.

But if Mamma got taken away, will she be in danger too?

Mostima:
Fiammetta...

Fiammetta:
Wait, you're actually using my name for once? What gives?

Mostima:
Aw, you don't like it? More a fan of 'Shimmering Vigil', then? Or do you want a new one?

Fiammetta:
Fiammetta's fine, thanks. Seriously though, what is it?

Mostima:
Say... my lovely coworkers should be in the Lateran Basilica right about now, no? Reminiscing about me, maybe?

Fiammetta:
If you're aware, then maybe you should show your face for once.

Mostima:
Nah, forget it, I'll never get used to the ambience in there.

Mostima:
Besides, who'd want to see a living warning sign rock on in there? They'd just be uncomfortable.

Fiammetta:
Since when do you care if other people are uncomfortable?

Mostima:
I'm not so bored I'd make myself unwelcome just for fun.

Fiammetta:
Objection: case in point. I'll admit you're enjoying being back here a lot more than I expected, though.

Mostima:
Really?

Fiammetta:
'Welcome to Laterano' and all that.

Mostima:
Ah, I think I'm just in high spirits. Probably from coming home after so long.

Fiammetta:
Yeah right.

Mostima:
Hahah, sure, whatever, let's go.

Fiammetta:
Where to?

Mostima:
To see her, of course.

Mostima:
Oh, maybe she's in a different hospital now?

Fiammetta:
It's been ages since the last time you returned, after all.

Fiammetta:
Follow me.

Ezell:
I haven't been to this pagus too often. It seems not too far from the outskirts... I should be nearly there, right? 7-265, Via Thervatius...

Ezell:
Is that an... Ecclesia Requietum hearse stopped by that door?

Ezell:
Hello? Excuse me, Sister!

Stoic Sister:
Calm down, young executor.

Ezell:
Have you finished the inspection already?

Pious Sister:
Correct. There was a Sankta who departed us by illness.

Ezell:
May I quickly verify the remains?

Ezell:
Confirmation complete. The deceased is the homeowner Feoria La Porta.

Ezell:
My assignment mentioned no will was discovered nearby. May I ask if you noticed anything resembling one during your inspection?

Stoic Sister:
We did not. However, this is for you... the Notarial Hall would wish to reclaim it, correct?

Ezell:
Is this... her patron firearm? Understood, I'll take it back with me. Thank you both.

Pious Sister:
If you're done with the identity check and arms reclamation, please allow us to convey her to the Ecclesia Requietum.

Ezell:
Ah, very well. Thank you for your time.

Ezell:
Identity of the deceased confirmed. If I want to find any pre-registration of a will through the Notarial Hall system... Right, I can do a long-ranged search from my terminal...

Ezell:
Census addresses... homeowners...

Ezell:
Er, she didn't prepare a will?

Ezell:
The diagnosis record states...

Ezell:
Ah, given the illness, giving up on hospital treatment makes sense... but why wouldn't she leave a will...?

Ezell:
Hm...? Is that a neighbor's child? Why is she hiding from me...?

Ezell:
Watch out!

Ezell:
Wha—did she faint? But why? She only tripped...

Ezell:
Does anyone know who this child's parents are?! Does she live nearby?

Troubled Lateran Citizen:
I've never seen her before. Is she passed out...? What if she bumped her head when she fell?

Composed Lateran Citizen:
I've never seen her either. Maybe she just moved in? I can ask around at the neighborhood hall.

Ardent Lateran Citizen:
What for?! If she's hit her head, then we need to get her to the hospital!

Ardent Lateran Citizen:
You hurry and take her there, executor. We live just around here. If her parents come looking, we'll point them straight to the hospital to find you.

Ezell:
Perfect, thank you all!

Lateran Citizen?:
Grr... I didn't think Cecelia would run straight into a Notarial right outside her home...

Lateran Citizen?:
What now, Patia?

Patia:
What else? Follow them, make sure she's safe... and get her out of the Notarial Hall's hands!
