Sciurus:
I was treating this like a holiday in Laterano... Never thought something like this would happen.

Sciurus:
Kjerag is a theocracy too, so why couldn't we have done this?

Yucatan:
Laterano is much more influential. The Legati were all part of the Apostle's plan.

Yucatan:
We simply don't have that sort of foundation.

Sciurus:
Influence, eh? It's only after leaving Kjerag that I learned how troublesome influence can be.

Sciurus:
Pretty amazing how Enciodes managed to negotiate with our neighboring countries all on his own.

Yucatan:
The Saintess's influence is on the rise too. We have our own advantages.

Sciurus:
But do you really think what the Lateran Pope is talking about is possible?

Yucatan:
I don't know.

Yucatan:
I can't imagine a world where all the nations are so tightly entwined with one another. It sounds like a dream, or maybe a nightmare.

Yucatan:
But no one can ignore the miracle that happened that day, or the Pope's speech.

Yucatan:
Is Laterano really the blessed city?

Sciurus:
What do the Sankta think of all this, Ezell?

Ezell:
Huh? Well, er... it was stunning?

Sciurus:
Figured as much. Apparently, that bell has not rung for thousands of years.

Sciurus:
So what will happen to Laterano now?

Ezell:
Perhaps not all that much, from what I know of the Laterans. Or maybe it's the same everywhere.

Ezell:
Turning points in history don't always seem so important at the time.

Ezell:
But we do perceive that change is happening, and we'll take up our own duties and responsibilities.

Sciurus:
Well said, brother.

Sciurus:
You can leave us here. We have a car on the way.

Yucatan:
Thank you.

Ezell:
No problem. Cardinal Velliv is at a hospital not far from here. I'll be reporting back to her directly.

Sciurus:
Please give her our thanks.

Ezell:
As long as you're satisfied. Those were her instructions.

Sciurus:
Nothing gets past her, huh?

Sciurus:
Say, can you take a photo of me and my husband?

Ezell:
Sure.

Ezell:
How is that?

Sciurus:
You're a pretty good photographer.

Yucatan:
Thanks.

Ezell:
You're welcome.

Mostima:
Say, Fiammetta, do you feel like your steps are heavier than usual?

Fiammetta:
Where's this coming from?

Mostima:
You don't feel a weight on your shoulders, after what His Holiness said?

Fiammetta:
Get to the point.

Mostima:
Well, I'm thinking I'm due for a career change. I'm not really cut out for a job with too much responsibility.

Mostima:
And you seem like just the girl to take myâ€”

Fiammetta:
In your dreams.

Ezell:
Good afternoon.

Mostima:
Long time no see, Ezell.

Ezell:
It's only been two weeks...

Fiammetta:
Are you on a mission?

Ezell:
An errand on behalf of Cardinal Velliv. I was just about to report back to her.

Ezell:
This is my final task in Laterano.

Mostima:
Not bad. Once you've seen the world, you'll realize how boring this place is.

Mostima:
There aren't as many great desserts out there, but... life is about more than just enjoyment, don't you think?

Fiammetta:
So you're going to meet with Velliv? Where is she?

Ezell:
Stevonus Central Hospital.

Fiammetta:
......

Mostima:
Let's go together then. We're headed the same way.

Velliv:
Have you made up your mind?

Lemuen:
Yes, I have.

Velliv:
I thought you'd need to mull it over a little longer.

Lemuen:
I just felt that I can't be the only one standing still, while everyone else has already taken the next step.

Velliv:
Then I have nothing to add. I'm glad you accepted.

Velliv:
It's wonderful to have someone like you join us, times being what they are.

Mostima:
I knew you'd be here, Velliv.

Velliv:
How did you...?

Fiammetta:
We ran into Ezell.

Ezell:
The emissaries from Kjerag have reached their destination.

Velliv:
Good work.

Velliv:
But don't leave just yet. I've got another task I could use your presence for.

Ezell:
Understood.

Velliv:
See you next week, Lemuen.

Lemuen:
See you.

Fiammetta:
Have you decided to join the Seventh Tribunal, Lemuen?

Lemuen:
Already on the job.

Fiammetta:
Hm, it won't be easy over there, after this conference.

Lemuen:
Don't you think we're a match made in heaven though?

Fiammetta:
I suppose.

Lemuen:
You've all chosen your paths. It's about time for me to think about what I can do too.

Mostima:
Speaking of, I was just talking to Fiammetta about quitting my job as a Legata.

Lemuen:
Too much trouble?

Mostima:
I mean, with the old man? I can already see the trouble waiting in the future.

Lemuen:
But you're not getting away that easily, Mostima. You answer to me now.

Mostima:
Oh.

Lemuen:
Here's your first job: bring this letter to El.

Mostima:
Can I say no?

Lemuen:
Nope.

Lemuen:
Deliver it to her personally.

Mostima:
Unemployment is sounding more appealing by the second.

Fiammetta:
Quit it with the lame excuses.

Mostima:
And there's my old taskmaster.

Fiammetta:
You won't give up.

Mostima:
How can you be so sure?

Fiammetta:
Don't pretend that you don't need this job.

Fiammetta:
You're looking for an answer, aren't you?

Mostima:
I'm not Andoain.

Fiammetta:
I didn't say you were.

Fiammetta:
But you have a choice to make, about who you are.

Fiammetta:
And to find that answer... one must have journeyed far enough.

Mostima:
......

Lemuen:
So how does it feel to be seen right through, Mostima? Sounds like you don't even need a halo to.

Mostima:
This is my own path, then. You shouldn't follow me, Fiammetta.

Fiammetta:
You think the world revolves around you? We just happen to be taking the same road.

Fiammetta:
I have his gun.

Fiammetta:
If he still sees himself as Sankta, he'll be back for it.

Fiammetta:
Then he'll pay for what he did!

Fiammetta:
And you'll help me.

Mostima:
Fine...

Lemuen:
By the way, the Astray that were caught in the city have been set free.

Fiammetta:
Is that His Holiness's will?

Lemuen:
Uh-huh.

Fiammetta:
His mercy is none of my business.

Lemuen:
I thought you might say something like that.

Lemuen:
Oh, and you'll be dispatched to Rhodes Island under the agreement with the Notarial Hall, through the Fifth Tribunal.

Fiammetta:
Er, you mean the pharmaceutical company that Mostima and Lemuel work part-time at?

Fiammetta:
Where's this coming from?

Lemuen:
Velliv wants to deepen our cooperation. You're as good as anyone for the role.

Lemuen:
Plus, we have a good track record with them. You should be well-supported.

Fiammetta:
Alright.

Lemuen:
Oh, by the way, I have some really good news for you!

Lemuen:
You get to choose from one of three code names for your next mission!

Fiammetta:
Do we really have to keep up this farce, now that you're our liaison?

Fiammetta:
We only used a temporary name in the first place because there's no clear role for keeping tabs on her.

Fiammetta:
I've had enough of these monthly name changes!

Mostima:
Didn't you like Shimmering Vigil? What was it that you said... 'they've finally come up with a decent name'?

Fiammetta:
Shut up.

Mostima:
Hey, nice flowers.

Lemuen:
Hate to break it to you, but the tradition of changing your title has become a rule unto itself. Just accept it.

Lemuen:
Here are your choices: Void Gourmet, Wasteland Pilot, or Dawn Destroyer.

Fiammetta:
...Dawn Destroyer.

Mostima:
Man, your tastes are so easy to guess.

Fiammetta:
I told you to shut up already!

Oren:
*exhales*...

Velliv:
You're awake?

Oren:
Luck has really not been on my side lately.

Velliv:
What's wrong? Getting bedsores from too much lying down?

Oren:
No, forget I said anything.

Oren:
Huh? Ezell?

Velliv:
I wanted him to see what happens to those who come close to betraying Laterano.

Ezell:
Er...

Oren:
Stop bullying the kid, Velliv.

Velliv:
Are you implying that I'm not young myself?

Oren:
Sorry.

Velliv:
You're no longer a Legatus.

Oren:
If that's the price I must pay, then...

Velliv:
But you're still my subordinate.

Oren:
...it's a heavy one.

Velliv:
You talk a big talk, Oren. Let's see what you learned in Victoria.

Oren:
Does that mean you need me to do things my way?

Velliv:
Remember that question you asked? I can answer it now.

Velliv:
I have no interest in being a woman of integrity.

Velliv:
But I respect those who have worked hard to earn the title.

Oren:
Well... I can't argue with that.

Ezell:
Was that intended for me as well?

Velliv:
Of course.

Velliv:
Treasure the opportunity you've been given with Cecelia. Don't ever let me know what... influence she will have on Laterano.

Ezell:
You don't want her returning here?

Velliv:
If I didn't, why would I waste time crafting an identity for her?

Velliv:
Other than, well, compassion. And the fact that she still has potential value that outweighs her risks.

Ezell:
......

Oren:
Trust me, there's no harm in getting this sort of candid promise.

Ezell:
I understand.

Velliv:
No need to be nervous. I'm simply expressing Laterano's sincerity.

Velliv:
If you two ever get tired of traveling, Laterano will be here.

Velliv:
Her doors will be open.

Velliv:
Come in.

Ezell:
Federico?

Federico:
Cardinal Velliv, here are the past two years of records regarding the activities of the former Legatus, Oren Argiolas.

Velliv:
Thank you, Executor Federico.

Oren:
Er...

Velliv:
Just in case.

Federico:
There is reason to believe that Executor Richele may be his accomplice. Should I summon him?

Velliv:
No need. He'll only claim to have been tricked by an old classmate, now won't he, Oren?

Oren:
Remind me never to pick a fight with you again.

Velliv:
I'll let Richele be. For now.

Velliv:
But I would like to speak with him through you, when it's convenient. You don't have a problem with that, do you?

Oren:
N-No, not at all.

Velliv:
Then the two of them have been dealt with for the moment, Executor Federico.

Oren:
......

Oren:
Hold on, Federico.

Federico:
What is it?

Oren:
I've been thinking. It couldn't have been easy to deduce that it was Feoria who met with the Sarkaz, just from a few sentences in a journal.

Oren:
Why were you so obsessed?

Oren:
Who were you seeking?

Federico:
...Arturia.

Oren:
Arturia... huh? Arturia?

Velliv:
The wanted criminal?

Oren:
What exactly is your relationship with her?

Federico:
A distant relative.

Oren:
Hahahaha!

Oren:
Seriously, man.

Oren:
If I could stand right now, I'd be dragging you to the nearest bar.

Federico:
I don't have time.

Oren:
You do, because I happened to run into an infamous fugitive a few years back. By the name of Arturia.

Velliv:
......

Oren:
Wait! Calm down, Velliv!

Oren:
I wasn't looking for her! It was a coincidence!

Oren:
Seriously, I like to think of myself as a veteran, but just thinking back on that experience sends a shiver down my spine.

Federico:
Where did you see her?

Oren:
Three years ago, in Leithanien.

Cecelia:
Mister Ezell!

Ezell:
Cecelia!

Ezell:
Richele...

Richele:
The paperwork is in order. She's now free to leave Laterano.

Ezell:
Thank you, Richele.

Richele:
Just doing my job.

Richele:
You know where you're going, right?

Ezell:
Well, we'll meet up with Federico and join a company by the name of Rhodes Island under a cooperation agreement. Apparently, it's more convenient this way, since we'll be spending a lot of time outside.

Richele:
Good. I've already contacted them.

Richele:
But you're still an executor of the Notarial Hall. Missions will be issued to you through Rhodes Island when it's inconvenient for you to return.

Richele:
That said, I have a hunch that your journey with her will go smoothly. You might find what you're looking for sooner rather than later.

Richele:
And my hunches are usually right.

Ezell:
Er, thanks?

Richele:
I'll be going, then. Goodbye, Cecelia.

Cecelia:
Bye-bye, Mister Richele.

Richele:
Ah-choo!

Richele:
Yikes. I'm getting a hunch that something bad's gonna happen...

Ezell:
Richele is an eccentric one too.

Ezell:
Hey, wait, how did he know that we're looking for something?

Cecelia:
What's wrong, Mister Ezell?

Ezell:
Nothing.

Ezell:
Is there anything else you want to say before we go?

Cecelia:
......

The girl lets go of the young Sankta's hand and walks to the center of the flower field.

Cecelia:
(I'm leaving Laterano, Mamma.)

Cecelia:
(But I'm not running away.)

Cecelia:
(I'm gonna find PapÃ  on my own, and tell him what you said.)

Cecelia:
(I wanna see the outside world for myself... I wanna see Kazdel.)

Cecelia:
(I'm happy, Mamma. Now, just like before...)

Cecelia:
(Please, watch over me.)

Cecelia:
Can I pick a white flower?

Sister:
Of course.

Cecelia:
Thank you!

Ezell:
You want to take this flower?

Cecelia:
Uh-huh.

Ezell:
Fresh flowers won't last long. I can press it for you.

Cecelia:
Will you teach me? I wanna learn for myself.

Cecelia:
Thanks, Mister Ezell.

Ezell:
Huh?

Ezell:
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

Cecelia:
Eh? Is that...?

Andoain:
Patia, are you really coming with me?

Patia:
Of course.

Andoain:
I was thinking you could stay here.

Patia:
Laterano doesn't have what I'm looking for.

Patia:
...?

Andoain:
What is it, Patia?

Patia:
Excuse me, that was out of line.

Patia:
But... did you just smile?

Patia:
Not to say that you don't normallyâ€”it's just that, well, something seems different.

Andoain:
Hmm...

Andoain:
For many years, I thought we walked alone in the wilderness. I was arrogant and immature.

Andoain:
Did you hear the old man's speech?

Patia:
I heard the second half when it woke me up. It was being broadcast all over the city. Loudly.

Andoain:
Yvangelista, the Patron Saint of Sacrifice and Unity. Perhaps he will go even further than the ten who took that name before him.

Andoain:
What a grand, yet fragile vision.

Andoain:
But one upon which I offer my blessings.

Patia:
What did you learn that day?

Andoain:
It's not important, Patia. Not so important, anyway.

Andoain:
Even if there is no reward waiting at the end of the journey, the act of continuing onward is, in itself, carrying the torch. Therefore, I will continue onward.

Andoain:
We do not trade for blessings, nor for pity. We walk the path that we believe in.

Andoain:
Because... it is the only way to live with dignity, is it not?

Rosella:
We should depart, Guide, before the sun sets.

Andoain:
Let us go, my brothers and sisters.

Ezell:
What are you looking at, Cecelia?

Cecelia:
No, nothing.

Cecelia:
The sunset is beautiful.
