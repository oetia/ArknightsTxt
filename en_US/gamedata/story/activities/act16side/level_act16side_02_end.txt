Ezell:
We're almost there... Cecelia, do you know these streets?

Cecelia:
Um... I've seen these houses before... but there's a lot of the same houses...

Ezell:
Did you just move here recently?

Cecelia:
Move? I don't remember moving...

Ezell:
Huh?

Cecelia:
Sorry, Mister Ezell, Mamma always took me outside at night. The roads look different in the dark.

Cecelia:
But I like to sneak peeks out the window to see what it's like outside... so I think I can do it! I'll try...

Ezell:
......

Ezell:
It's okay, Cecelia, we'll find it. We haven't reached the place I met you yet.

Cecelia:
Eyah!

Cecelia:
Sorry... I was looking at the houses, I didn't see you.

Ardent Lateran Citizen:
Hm? Aren't you that girl who fainted and went to the hospital this morning? Are you alright now?

Ezell:
Oh, it's you! Um, she's... she's fine.

Ezell:
Say, did anyone come looking for her?

Ardent Lateran Citizen:
I stayed on watch until noon! But nobody showed up. It's strange. What are her parents up to?

Ezell:
Cecelia says she lives right around here. You're sure you've never seen her?

Ardent Lateran Citizen:
I'd definitely remember seeing such an adorable little girl! I suppose I don't need to stand around here worrying my head off anymore.

Ardent Lateran Citizen:
Actually, going to talk to the neighborhood hall isn't the worst idea. If her family's just moved in here, then they'll be sure to have records.

Ardent Lateran Citizen:
Ooh, lucky, that's Paula right there!

Ardent Lateran Citizen:
Seniora Paula! Over here!

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
Hm, what's the matter? I'm running back to the hall right now, so let's walk and talk.

Ardent Lateran Citizen:
Have we had any new households move in recently?

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
Of course we have... but how recently are you talking?

Ardent Lateran Citizen:
Do you remember roughly when you moved in, little miss?

Cecelia:
...didn't just move... been living here a really long time...

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
Huh? Little lady, can I have your name?

Cecelia:
I'm Cecelia...

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
Hm... that doesn't make sense. I've been working here for over a decade. If you moved in a long time ago...

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
Cecelia, do you know your mama and papa's names?

Cecelia:
Mamma's name is... Feoria.

Ezell:
!!!!!

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
Wha-Wh-What? Feoria, the one on Via Thervatius? Doesn't Feoria live alone? Where did she get a child as big as you?

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
But looking at you... you do bear a strong resemblance.

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
That's odd... illegitimate, really? Cecelia, when you say you've been living here long, you mean your mama?

Cecelia:
Yes...

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
Are you looking for your mama?

Cecelia:
Yeah, I want to find Mamma...

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
Well, then, senior, you must be... Feoria's relative or the like? Have you been fostering this girl out in the country? You've brought her to see her mother?

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
Never saw this coming. No wonder she'd always avoid any introductions... Such a grown child, all this time.

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
Excuse me, senior? Um? Are you alright?

Ezell:
......

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
We just about made it while we were talking. Feoria's house is right there. Should I knock on the door for you?

Ezell:
...7-265, Via Thervatius.

Intellectual Lateran Citizen:
Huh? Oh, you know the address, then.

Ezell:
Yes. I do.

Cecelia:
Mister Ezell, what's wrong? That look on your face...

Ezell:
I'm fine, Cecelia.... Let's get our—you—um, home for now.

Ezell:
Come on, let's go.

The name.

Ever since finding Cecelia, the surprises have come so fast, it slipped my mind to even ask her 'what's your mama's name?'

The name...

An ill mother, white-clothed executor, people in gowns...

......

How do I tell Cecelia?

Where do I take her to find her mama, now?

......

Fiammetta:
You're a Liberi. Why are you out to abduct a Sankta girl?

Patia:
You're a Liberi. Why are you PROTECTING a Sankta girl?

Fiammetta:
I'm protecting the Commandments of Laterano.

Patia:
Commandments? When have the Sankta's commandments ever actually applied to Liberi?

Patia:
Fiammetta, do you seriously believe Lateran Liberi are a part of Laterano?

Fiammetta:
What makes us not? I was born here. I grew up here.

Fiammetta:
Listen. Do you know what you're even saying, Patia?

Patia:
Of course I know...

Patia:
You're the one who hasn't got it straight.

Patia:
The Liberi living in Laterano all take the Lateran Commandments as guiding principles, we believe in the 'Lateran teachings', we see Sankta as... living miracles!

Patia:
Firearms, commandments, halos, empathy...

Patia:
Suppose they're all Sankta miracles, sure! But do they have a single thing to do with Lateran Liberi?!

Patia:
Why do the Liberi have to believe in a miracle that will never, ever come to us?!

Patia:
All of Laterano, all of the Lateran Church, belongs to nobody except the Sankta! Do you still not understand, Fiammetta?!

Patia:
Do you seriously believe you've become a part of them?

Fiammetta:
......

Patia:
Too easy!

Fiammetta:
Ugh...

Patia:
Looks like you're not so staunch after all.

Patia:
Fiammetta, Fiammetta. Think it over, carefully, I'm begging you...

Patia:
I told you before I came from Iberia... do you know what it's like there? I can tell you, a lot of Iberians are even more devout than the Laterans.

Patia:
But what did they get for it?

Patia:
The people of Iberia have their fantasies of Laterano, thousands of miles away... That, I can understand.

Patia:
But why are the Lateran Liberi right there within reach, and still so delighted to give their lives for this bunch of Sankta partying about in their own closed-off golden age of forever?

Patia:
Why, Fiammetta?! Tell me!

Fiammetta:
......

Patia:
You...

Fiammetta:
Get out of the way.

Patia:
I'm wasting my breath, aren't I?

Fiammetta:
You have your views, Patia.

Fiammetta:
And I have mine.

Patia:
Then tell me!

Patia:
Explain it! Why... would you rather chase something you know you'll never reach? Why aren't you willing to give even... one look behind?

Fiammetta:
I don't know what you're talking about.

Fiammetta:
Besides, is a smattering of words from me really going to change your mind?

Fiammetta:
If a someone's views are so easy to change, then they can't be worth that much to begin with.

Patia:
......

Fiammetta:
Get out of the way.

Fiammetta:
I know you're only here to stall me.

Fiammetta:
But you know you can't hold me.

Fiammetta:
We both have work to do.

Fiammetta:
Your companions are... practically no different from any civilian. Do you want them paying the price for you?

Fiammetta:
You don't, Patia. So get out of the way, and save us both the effort.

Ezell:
We're home, Cecelia.

Cecelia:
Um... I don't have the key, I can't get in... Mister Ezell, can you...

Cecelia:
Are you really okay? Do you feel bad...? You've been looking down for a while.

Ezell:
I'm fine. Let me get the door open...

Cecelia:
Why did the lady just now say you actually knew our address?

Ezell:
......

Ezell:
Cecelia, do you recognize this firearm?

Cecelia:
Is this—Mamma's guardian gun?

Cecelia:
Mister Ezell... why do you have Mamma's gun...?

Ezell:
I'm sorry, Cecelia...

Cecelia:
Sorry for what...?

Cecelia:
I don't really understand.

Cecelia:
You... You know where Mamma is, don't you?

Ezell:
Yes, I do... I'm sorry, Cecelia.

Ezell:
I'm sorry... I don't know why I'm apologizing, either... I'm sorry.

Ezell:
Cecelia—your mother—passed away.

Ezell:
She's not here anymore.

Cecelia:
If she's not here, where is she then? What does... 'passed away' mean?

Cecelia:
I remember, this morning, Mamma said she was going somewhere, and she couldn't take me with her... Did you go there with her, Mister Ezell?

Cecelia:
Can you... take me there too? Just once, just for a little bit?

Cecelia:
I—I won't be selfish, and I'll listen to Mamma, and I won't stay there and say I won't leave... so... so...

Cecelia:
Can you let me see Mamma one more time?

Cecelia:
I haven't said goodbye to her yet.

Ezell:
......

Oren:
Uh, what's happening? Why is she crying, Ezell? Just what did you do to a poor little girl?

Ezell:
Who are you? Hold on, that uniform... You're a Legatus?

Oren:
Very sharp eyes, Senior Ezell.

Oren:
By order of His Holiness the Pope, I'm here to take Cecelia to the Basilica.

Ezell:
..................

Oren:
Whoops, forgot to introduce myself. My name's Oren Argiolas. If you want to check my identity, no harm in using your regulation terminal from the Hall there.

Oren:
Oh, no, forgot that too. You turned it off, didn't you?

Ezell:
How did you find this place, then?

Oren:
Senior Ezell, you underestimate a Legatus. You thought your movements would be hard to track? Or did you think you were so thorough, you left zero trace along the way?

Ezell:
Your Excellency... If you're going to take Cecelia away, can I at least ask you a few questions first?

Oren:
Hahah, you're funny, senior. You think I have to answer what you ask?

Oren:
But I'm not such a cruel man... so shoot.

Ezell:
Just who is Cecelia?

Ezell:
Was she... born a fallen angel?

Oren:
Colorful imagination, Ezell.

Oren:
But it's not as mysterious as you think.

Oren:
Cecelia's mixed-blood, that's all.

Ezell:
What? That's not possible... A Sankta's mixed-blood child can't be a Sankta!

Ezell:
There are very few cases of Sankta mixing blood with other races... but it's not rare enough to alarm the Lateran Church...

Oren:
You know the reason perfectly well, then.

Oren:
Offspring of Sankta and other races don't become Sankta.

Oren:
A Sankta and Feline's child turns out Feline, a Sankta and Forte's child turns out Forte.

Oren:
Mixed Sankta offspring don't get their halo and wings of light when they say their first word, and they can't empathetically sense other Sankta.

Oren:
To put it simply, they won't have any of the Sankta's distinguishing features. Without exception...

Oren:
That's the generally accepted wisdom, anyway.

Ezell:
Cecelia is an exception.

Oren:
She's a Sankta who shouldn't have turned out as one.

Ezell:
My second question is, should Cecelia is taken to the Basilica, how the Lateran will... treat her?

Oren:
I don't know.

Oren:
Don't give me that look, Ezell. If I was going to lie to you, I'd feed you a much kinder one, no problem.

Oren:
But the reality's what you see. Cecelia is an 'exception.' I couldn't tell you how the Pope is going to handle this.

Oren:
But this Holy Father of ours... I don't know what impression you have of him, but, well.

Oren:
At least, as I'm given to understand, he's not known to use extreme methods.

Oren:
And look at how cute Cecelia is. How hardhearted would someone have to be to harm her, right?

Ezell:
Third question.

Ezell:
I cannot entirely trust your answers... I wish to accompany Cecelia to the Basilica.

Oren:
Um, is that a question?

Oren:
Sorry, but that's the one 'question' you'll have to forgive my answer on...

???:
Oren, what are you doing here?

Oren:
......
