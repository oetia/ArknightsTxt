Fiammetta:
So you're able to move around without your wheelchair now?

Lemuen:
Yes, I've been rehabilitating pretty well.

Lemuen:
Last year, they had a wheelchair rapid-firing contest, which I won... and then the doctors banned me from competing again.

Fiammetta:
We'd have to look for a Gun-Knight to beat your firing skills, I think.

Lemuen:
Aww, that's nice to hear.

Lemuen:
I'd be even happier if SOMEONE learned how to say a few nice words to the sick, like my darling Fiammetta here.

Fiammetta:
Mostima, are you just going to stand there pretending you're the curtains?

Mostima:
You know I'm not the type, Lemuen.

Lemuen:
What type? This is your first time back in two or three years. My memory's not that good.

Mostima:
Fine. Lemuen fires better than anyone I know. Her skills are incredible.

Lemuen:
Mm-hm, that's more like it.

Lemuen:
Is El doing alright in Lungmen?

Mostima:
I saw her recently. She's doing great.

Mostima:
You'd better worry about yourself before her.

Lemuen:
And I'll copy those words right back at you.

Lemuen:
How long are you going to stay this time?

Mostima:
Dunno, really. But it'll be at least until the conference's over, Wednesday after next, I think?

Fiammetta:
Tuesday after.

Mostima:
Oh, Tuesday. Otherwise, it's up to how that old weirdo feels. Who knows if he'll send me on some weird and wacky assignment again.

Fiammetta:
Did you just call His Holiness...?

Mostima:
He's not gonna mind, Fiammetta.

Lemuen:
If you want to stay for a bit longer, I could help you there.

Mostima:
That so.

Lemuen:
Did you figure it out already?

Fiammetta:
Figure what out? What are you two talking about?

Mostima:
Did you really not realize, Fiammetta?

Mostima:
Who we've been handing our reports to for the last half year?

Lemuen:
Was it that obvious?

Fiammetta:
Wh-What...? Wait, Lemuen... you got a job at the Lateran Church? While you're still in rehab...?

Lemuen:
Don't worry, it's just some secretary work.

Mostima:
How long will you stick with it?

Lemuen:
I'm not sure yet.

Fiammetta:
Will you return to the Guard?

Lemuen:
Little chance of that now.

Fiammetta:
Your marksmanship, overlooked just like that... it's a mind-boggling waste.

Lemuen:
You judge me so highly, Fiammetta, even though I messed it all up.

Fiammetta:
......

Fiammetta:
That wasn't your fault.

Lemuen:
And it wasn't yours either.

Lemuen:
Don't stretch yourself too thin.

Fiammetta:
The day will come when I settle the matter with him.

Lemuen:
Oh, well. Mostima...

Lemuen:
Can I rub your horns?

Mostima:
No.

Lemuen:
Spoilsport.

Lemuen gazes out the window as Mostima stands beside it, idly playing with the flowers in her hands.

In a flash, Fiammetta returns to a time before.

The sun shines ever bright and beautiful during a Lateran springtime, and a hint of chill rides the air.

Through the window, she spots the roofs of church buildings large and small. Here and there, now and then, fowlbeasts streak across the sky.

Lemuen is peaceful in any ordinary time, occasionally uttering a remark or two. Around her, the atmosphere softens.

The standoffish Mostima relaxes without realizing, unable to sense the smile she lets slip.

......

Just as always.

As if none of it ever happened.

But it's only an illusion.

After that night, not a night more could she soundly sleep.

Fiammetta:
Lemuen...

Mostima:
Something's on my mind, Lemuen.

Mostima:
Does this hospital have all that many volunteers?

Lemuen:
Hm? I suppose.

Lemuen:
Come in.

Conscientious Doctor:
Seniora Lemuen, I want you to look at this...

Conscientious Doctor:
Oh, you have visitors?

Lemuen:
It's alright, they're old war buddies of mine.

Conscientious Doctor:
War buddies... you don't mean—!

Lemuen:
That's right.

Conscientious Doctor:
In that case, maybe all three of you could take a look at these test results...

Velliv:
Oren, do you know what you're doing?

Oren:
Maybe you'll be kind enough to tell me?

Velliv:
She's not going to think of your methods as just 'personal conduct.'

Oren:
She'll be thinking we're going out of our way to exhibit 'the Lateran stance.'

Velliv:
Slip up for a moment and this becomes a diplomatic incident.

Oren:
Isn't that exactly what you want?

Oren:
Conflict leads to issues, issues require resolution, resolution needs a channel.

Oren:
Laterano's providing a whole new way to resolve issues.

Velliv:
And we provide this method under two prerequisites—what we say has to carry enough weight, and what we say has to be 'appropriate'.

Oren:
Right, Laterano needs to have an 'appropriate stance.' If all we brought to the table was an ordinary roll of the dice, who'd need Laterano?

Oren:
—Wouldn't you say, Your Holiness?

The Pope:
Do you agree with him, Vel?

Velliv:
He's pretending to be smart.

Velliv:
The reason Laterano stands upon this land, and the reason the Legati can cross all borders, is that Laterano possesses faith.

Oren:
No, it's because of Laterano itself that the Legati are given passage, Your Eminence.

Oren:
We all know clear as day that the true Lateran faith can't reach beyond the Sankta. I'm sorry, but it might let you down if you count on it to get things done.

Velliv:
Oren, if you seek death, you can apply through the proper channels.

The Pope:
Truthfully, I've never understood how you two manage to fight so much.

Oren:
When I set out on my way back from Victoria to Laterano, Duke Gododdin asked me a question, and I believe it's not one I'm equipped to answer.

Oren:
He asked: 'Does anywhere in Laterano suffice to draw me there?'

Velliv:
......

Oren:
Your Holiness, when we're sat at the playing table, will the cards in our hand be enough?

Apostolic Knight:
Your Holiness, Mostima wishes to speak with you.

Apostolic Knight:
She states that what she must report cannot be heard by any other.

Oren:
Then we'll step outta your hair.

The Pope:
You may go.

The Pope:
Put her through.

Apostolic Knight:
Understood.

Mostima:
Time sure does fly, Your Holiness.

The Pope:
A good while, my child. Is Lemuen well?

Mostima:
No hiding anything from you.

Mostima:
We've seen something interesting here at this hospital.

The Pope:
Go on.

Mostima:
I saw the results of a physical checkup, and some of the signs look verrrry familiar.

The Pope:
Say no more before you return to the Basilica, Mostima.

Mostima:
Understood. Fiammetta'll go find the person these results belong to.

Oren:
I know the hospital Lemuen's recovering at is in... Pagus Stevonus.

Oren:
Stevonus.

Oren:
Something that'd make Mostima use a dedicated line...

Oren:
......

Oren:
Oh, quit messing with me.

Amiable Hospital Attendant:
Cecelia, do you feel alright?

Cecelia:
My head really hurt before... It's a bit better now.

Amiable Hospital Attendant:
In that case, I'll carry you out.

Cecelia:
Out...? Who are you?

Patia:
We're your companions, Cecelia. There's someone waiting for you.

Cecelia:
Mamma?

Patia:
I'm afraid it's not her.

Patia:
Your mother won't come back, Cecelia.

Cecelia:
Why?

Patia:
I'm sorry, I can't explain it to you.

Patia:
But someone can. I'll take you to see him.

Cecelia:
I'm sorry, Miss, but I want to find Mamma first.

Patia:
I'm really not good with kids. Sorry, Cecelia, whether you want to or not, I have to bring you away. You aren't safe here.

Ezell:
Cecelia!

Patia:
Grr, too quick...

Ezell:
Who are you? What are you doing with Cecelia?

Patia:
Not for you to know, Sankta.

Patia:
Cecelia was a companion of ours from the start. You're the one stealing her away.

Ezell:
In that case, please tell me her parents' family name, her home address, identity number, and your blood or legal relationship to her.

Patia:
Ugh, Notarial Hall brainrot.

Ezell:
If you have proper grounds to leave with Cecelia, you can tell me, and I'll take it into account in my decision.

Patia:
If you were a Liberi, I'd consider it. But Sankta like you... no chance.

Ezell:
You bear the Lateran symbol. You're a Liberi of Laterano yourself. Why hate the Sankta?

Patia:
Lemme tell you something, you Notarial Hall scumbag.

Patia:
The thing I hate second most in my life is when people like you—selfishly assume—it has to be a law of nature that every Liberi who lives in Laterano gets along great with Sankta!

Ezell:
If you don't plan on elucidating your grounds, I won't let you take Cecelia.

Patia:
Not your call.

Patia:
I'll hold him off. You take Cecelia.

Amiable Hospital Attendant:
Right.

Amiable Hospital Attendant:
Sorry, Cecelia. Just bear with it.

Cecelia:
...I don't want to.

Patia:
What's happening?! What was that explosion? And the smoke?!

Amiable Hospital Attendant:
The window...! It must've been when...

Ezell:
There was a strong gust of wind just now. I'll close the window, in case she'd catch a cold.

Patia:
Goddamned executor!

Patia:
I'll give you a word of advice! If you truly care about Cecelia, then don't give her up to the Notarial Hall or the Lateran Church! Or else, you'll regret it!

Ezell:
......

Ezell:
Cecelia, hold on tight.

Cecelia:
Right...

Ezell:
Are you alright?

Cecelia:
Yes.

Ezell:
Good. We need to break free of them, then.

Amiable Hospital Attendant:
Is he going to listen...?

Patia:
Of course he won't. Sankta are a bunch of happy-go-lucky idiots, but the ones at the Notarial Hall don't even get the 'happy-go-lucky' part.

Patia:
Whether he listens or not, we need to ensure Cecelia is... in our hands before we can proceed.

Amiable Hospital Attendant:
Then we need to notify the others ASAP.

Patia:
Already done.

Amiable Hospital Attendant:
Huh?

Patia:
While I was talking to him just now.

Amiable Hospital Attendant:
Ooh—you wanted to hold him up so you could send word out...

Patia:
He can't outrun us.

Fiammetta:
Why was the door to this ward open?

Fiammetta:
Wh... Is that you, Patia?

Patia:
......

Fiammetta:
Was there an eight-year-old Sankta girl staying in this ward?

Patia:
No.

Fiammetta:
I heard an explosion on the way here. Did you have something to do with that?

Patia:
What's so weird about explosions in Laterano?

Fiammetta:
Are you really the Patia I know?

Patia:
Fiammetta. The girl you're looking for's already out of hospital.

Fiammetta:
(She's definitely not here...)

Fiammetta:
Why are you here?

Patia:
What, you get to show up in Stevonus Central Hospital, but I don't?

Fiammetta:
Are the Guard looking for this girl too? Where'd you get this information?

Patia:
I left the Pontifica Cohors long ago. Weren't you off being a Legatus's bodyguard? What, now you're back in Laterano again looking for some Sankta girl?

Patia:
Don't you just love being surrounded by Sankta?

Patia:
Liberi like you are all...

Fiammetta:
Patia. What's happened to you since I left?

Patia:
Don't ask that like you actually care.

Fiammetta:
Enough. You don't need to talk to me like that.

Fiammetta:
If the girl's not here, I don't need to waste any more time with you either.

Patia:
Forget what happened to me. You should be wondering just what you're doing, Fiammetta... Miss Veteran.

???:
Tsk-tsk, Patia. Here I thought you loved your precious Fiammetta. Here you are with her again of all the things, and this is how cruel you treat her?

Patia:
What's it to you? And what about the Notarial Hall kid? What's your plan?

???:
Don't get so gruff, Patia. I might have an even better solution.

???:
But I'll need another small favor from you.
