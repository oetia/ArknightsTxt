Sciurus:
Yucatan... doesn't Lateran food bug you at least, like, a little...?

Yucatan:
Tastes here definitely lean on the sugary side, compared to Kjerag.

Yucatan:
Don't you like sweet, though, Rus?

Sciurus:
That doesn't mean I can take everything sweet!

Sciurus:
*Sigh* I'm starting to miss Kjerag now.

Sciurus:
It's that bitch Ratatos's fault, all blah blah 'grab every opportunity to reestablish our clan's status'... and she didn’t even come herself, throwing me under the sleigh out here.

Yucatan:
It's a show of the Matriarch's trust in you. After that incident put us on the brink, it was your joint efforts with her that ensured the Browntails held on.

Sciurus:
And you got tossed off to the side. You just love living behind the scenes, don't you?

Yucatan:
Personally speaking, getting to see you shine is more than enough satisfaction for me, Rus.

Sciurus:
Ooh, when did you learn to talk so smooth?

Yucatan:
That aside, Madame, this conference may turn out more fruitful than we expected.

Yucatan:
We didn't think so many countries would be here. It seems we might've underestimated Laterano's influence.

Sciurus:
Yeah, that does sound about right... but don't you change the subject!

Scathing Leithanian:
(Leithanian) Ugh, do you not have eyes?!

Sciurus:
(Leithanian) You bumped into me, I think.

Scathing Leithanian:
Your Leithanian is an embarrassment. What corner of the hinterland did you scurry out of?

Sciurus:
I come from Kjerag, and it's certainly not the 'hinterland.'

Scathing Leithanian:
Kjerag?

Scathing Leithanian:
What kind of place is Kjerag?

Cheery Legatus:
Lady Sharon, Kjerag is the nation of the Snow Realm in the buffer zone between Victoria, Columbia, and Kazimierz.

Scathing Leithanian:
There's a country in those mountains? Hah, the very definition of hinterland!

Scathing Leithanian:
You think an envoy of a trifling glacial state has the standing to be flippant with me, a duchess?

Sciurus:
Madame, first, I have to stress again, Kjerag isn't some 'hinterland' like you keep saying. You can probably thank your own narrow mind that you've never heard of my country.

Sciurus:
Second, you're the one who bumped into me. You owe me an apology.

Scathing Leithanian:
You dare!

Cheery Legatus:
Lady Sharon, we're in the Basilica...

Oren:
Lady Sharon, permit I remind you, you currently stand in Laterano, and not your Leithanian domain.

Scathing Leithanian:
And who are you?

Oren:
A Lateran Legatus.

Scathing Leithanian:
What are you trying to tell me, Legatus? This is the Basilica? What, do you intend to declare that as the host, Laterano sides with this provincial creature?

Oren:
Laterano sides with order. Therefore, Lady Sharon, you should apologize to Madame Sciurus.

Sciurus:
You know my name?

Oren:
You'd expect me to know the names of all the diplomatic envoys, wouldn't you?

Scathing Leithanian:
Oh? Then you must be well aware of who I am.

Oren:
Of course, Duchess Francis of Leithanien.

Oren:
But permit I remind you again, this is Laterano, Duchess.

Oren:
In Laterano, you are asked to honor the Commandments and orderly abide the rule of law. No matter what privileges you enjoy in Leithanien, they do not exist nor apply in Laterano.

Scathing Leithanian:
This is how Laterano treats its guests?

Oren:
If you're willing to be a 'guest of Laterano,' Laterano will wholeheartedly treat you in kind.

Velliv:
—Oren, when did you start standing for Laterano, huh?

Oren:
As a Lateran Legatus, do I not have the right?

Velliv:
Not in the Basilica.

Velliv:
Lady Sharon, please quell your anger.

Scathing Leithanian:
Hmph. Don't you think it's a little late to be pacifying me, cardinal?

Velliv:
Your Grace, I beg your understanding. The Legatus who contradicted you will be given an appropriate punishment. And rest assured of the Laterano's goodwill during your stay in the guesthouse.

Velliv:
Madame Sciurus, I beg your pardon as well. This fault for this minor misunderstanding lies with our shortcomings. If you would be willing to magnanimously accept my apologies, I hope to invite you in a short while to the side rooms for a talk.

Sciurus looks at Yucatan, and Yucatan gives a subtle nod.

Scathing Leithanian:
Hah, Laterans. My, my.

Velliv:
Alessoe, Mattina, please look after these three most important guests in my stead.

Velliv:
Oren, come with me.

Oren:
Here comes the punishment. Alright, alright...

Ezell:
Yes, the deceased in Pagus Stevonus did not leave behind a will nor any prior registration of one. I'll return to the Notarial Hall in a bit and submit for double-checking.

Ezell:
Currently? I'm at Pagus Stevonus Central Hospital... No, no, I'm alright, I just found a girl injured in a fall, I'm taking her to be examined right now...

Ezell:
No, I wasn't in a traffic accident...

Ezell:
No, the parents aren't with her. She's still unconscious, and for the time being we can't confirm her family circumstances. Once she wakes up, I'll bring her back to her guardians.

Ezell:
Right, and if she doesn't wake up soon, I might need to use Notarial Hall privileges to...

Ezell:
...Pardon? I can consider this one of my practical assignments...? Alright, I'll fill in all the documents after it's over.

Ezell:
Ah... sorry for that, I'm finished.

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
It's alright! The doc's physical checkup is done. No wounds anywhere, nothing on her head, so it probably wasn't a knock on the brain.

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
But the girl does have a small fever. Odds are she was ill. She'll still need a few more tests before we're sure what caused her to pass out, but it won't be anything too bad.

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
Doc's set her up in Ward 2127. You can wait there for the examination results.

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
Is she your sister? Are you on duty? Why are you bringing your little sister on an executor shift? I barely ever see executors here in Stevonus!

Ezell:
She's not my sister.

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
So why did you bring her here? Is she your target? Oh, Heavens, are executors really that ruthless? You'd execute a little girl like that? What did she do?

Ezell:
I only came across her in the street. She's not my target. She just lives in the vicinity, in all likelihood.

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
Really? She must be new around here, then.

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
This is the only hospital in Stevonus, so all the kids come here for checkups when they're sick... you should see the sight of the consulting room at Pediatrics whenever the seasons change. It's exhausting!

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
Lucky I'm on shift at Recovery next week. Have you heard of our Recovery department? It's famous!

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
The wheelchair rapid-fire competition last year there, oh, heavens me, I've never seen guns blaze that fast before, I still suspect that must've been a Gun-Knight... a little bit young for it, though.

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
What's that look for? Didn't I tell you Recovery was famous? We have multiple people from the Basilica all recuperating here!

Ezell:
Did you just say... the girl I brought here was newly moved into Stevonus?

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
I've never seen her before, that's why. If she's not your sister, then a kid that small can't have come scampering from another pagus, can she?

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
Well, obviously, there's the possibility I've just never seen her by pure chance. But I can tell a girl like her falls ill day in and day out... I've seen too many of them!

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
Where was I? Consulting in Pediatrics? Listen, last week...

Serious Nurse:
Here you are gossiping with the family again, Elisa. The doctor wants you at the test center to pick up the results.

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
On it—

Ezell:
......

Conscientious Doctor:
You're sure you fetched the right report?

Blabbermouth Hospital Attendant:
Yyyes. Is there a problem?

Conscientious Doctor:
I've never seen a blood analysis this strange before.

Conscientious Doctor:
Once it's photocopied, send the original to the head doctor's office, along with this note from me.

Conscientious Doctor:
I need to pay a visit to Recovery.

Lateran Citizen?:
Hmph, that attendant's headed for the head doctor's office. So what now, Patia?

Patia:
Allocate two to hold the report-deliverer back. Don't go big. Just hold things off, win a little time, and we're fine.

Patia:
What about that doctor?

Lateran Citizen?:
It looks like he's gone for Recovery. But not the end Cecelia's in.

Patia:
Hm? That works. This way, the executor'll still be in the dark for now.

Patia:
Everyone else, with me. We'll draw the executor away, and get Cecelia out before the hospital's people reach her.

Patia:
Remember, move quick, but don't be rough with Cecelia.

Patia:
She's our companion.

Patia:
Don't make her hate us.

Cecelia:
Unnh... nnh....

Cecelia:
Mamma...

Ezell:
You're awake!

Cecelia:
Who... Where am I...?

Ezell:
You're in the hospital, Miss. You fainted in the street, and I took you here since I couldn't find your parents.

Cecelia:
Hospital... is this a hospital?

Cecelia:
No... you—you're wearing a uniform, Mamma said...

Cecelia:
......

Ezell:
Has your mama been telling you things?

Ezell:
(Come to think of it, when I first saw her, wasn't she hiding from me...?)

Ezell:
It's alright, Miss, I can take you to find your mama. I'm a good guy.

Cecelia:
You can help me find Mamma? Ma—Mamma got taken away by people in gowns!

Ezell:
(This might just be a kidnapping case! Is that why she was all alone there?)

Ezell:
Okay, little Miss, stay calm. I'm a Notarial Hall executor. I'll help you find your mama. How did she get taken away?

Cecelia:
You're a Notarial Hall...

Ezell:
That's right, I'm from the Notarial Hall. My name's Ezell. Look, here's my name tag.

Cecelia:
......

Cecelia:
Will you really help me find Mamma?

Ezell:
Of course. What's your name?

Cecelia:
...I'm Cecelia.

Cecelia:
...Nngh...

Ezell:
Huh?! What's wrong with... your halo...?

Ezell:
(What is this about...? Even in the most downcast moods, Sankta halos don't dim like this.)

Ezell:
(Unless...)

Ezell:
(But a child this small wouldn't even have a patron firearm yet. What could explain this...?)

Cecelia:
...Nnnh...

Ezell:
(No. Beyond that...)

Ezell:
Cecelia, how do you feel? Is your halo...?

Cecelia:
Sometimes... it goes like this... Mamma says I'm ill... it'll be fine soon...

Ezell:
......

Ezell has realized something.

Amidst her current pain, Cecelia is anxious about her missing mother too.

But he cannot sense any of her pain, nor anxiety, relayed from her.

Cecelia... is without a doubt a Sankta.

How could this be possible?

Ezell:
Cecelia, are you...

Reserved Hospital Attendant:
Are you this girl's relative?

Ezell:
Functionally.

Reserved Hospital Attendant:
Come with me. She's got somewhat special circumstances, and the doctor said he needs to talk with you in private.

Ezell:
......

Ezell:
There was a strong gust of wind just now. I'll close the window, in case she'd catch a cold.

Reserved Hospital Attendant:
Hm? Of course.

Ezell:
Alright. Cecelia, just get some rest, I'll be right back.

Amiable Hospital Attendant:
Don't worry, Cecelia. We'll keep you company.

Ezell:
......

Ezell:
The rooftop.

Ezell:
You said Cecelia's circumstances were special. Special how?

Reserved Hospital Attendant:
Well... we can't be exactly sure yet. We'll need to wait for the diagnosis. The doctor will be here shortly. Just hold on, and we'll see what he has to say.

Ezell:
I've already reported Cecelia's situation to the Notarial Hall. My colleagues are fast on their way.

Reserved Hospital Attendant:
What?!

Ezell:
Tell me who you are.

Reserved Hospital Attendant:
I'm an attendant, right? What are you talking about? The doctor will be here momentarily.

Ezell:
Would a normal hospital attendant get nervous hearing the words 'Notarial Hall?'

Reserved Hospital Attendant:
So you suckered me... I only needed to keep you here for a short while anyway. If I were you, I wouldn't be giving myself trouble.

Reserved Hospital Attendant:
Patia said to be more gentle with Cecelia... but not with you.

Ezell:
'Patia,' was it?

Reserved Hospital Attendant:
You'd do well to forget that one.

Reserved Hospital Attendant:
Come on out. Let's give our Notarial Hall man some break time.
