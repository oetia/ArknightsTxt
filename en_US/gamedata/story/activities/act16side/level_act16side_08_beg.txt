The Pope:
Sigh...

The Pope:
Forget it, I'll pay for it myself. The repairs here cost too much.

The Pope:
We'll just have to cut back on the afternoon tea and sweets.

Apostolic Knight:
Your Holiness! I heard the sound of fighting coming from the Basilica! Are you alright?

Apostolic Knight:
What... You were attacked by heretics?! I'm sorry! I failed in my duties!

The Pope:
Fret not, Paolario. Did you forget who won the Basilica's last arm wrestling tournament?

Apostolic Knight:
You did.

The Pope:
I was just exercising my wrist a bit, and ended up causing a bit of an accident.

The Pope:
The unrest within the city has already subsided.

Apostolic Knight:
Yes, they've dispersed. I didn't even get a chance to grill––

???:
Excuse me, can I come in?

Apostolic Knight:
Ahem, my apologies. Your Holiness, I'm making a fool of myself.

Apostolic Knight:
What I meant was, the ones you asked for are here.

The Pope:
Please come in, my children.

Ezell:
Salutations, Your Holiness...

Cecelia:
Good day, Your Holiness. I am Cecelia.

The Pope:
Ah, welcome. You'll have to forgive me for the mess here.

The Pope:
As for you two...

The Pope:
What sweets do you like with tea?

Cecelia:
Do you... need me to make something?

The Pope:
Hmm, let me think...

The Pope:
Maybe add a few cubes of sugar into your teacup?

The Pope:
Ezell, perhaps you should add a few more. Some sweetness will mellow out your nerves.

Ezell:
Ah! Y-Yes...

Cecelia:
Your Holiness, if I... wanted to leave Laterano, would you let me go?

The Pope:
If I said no, would you obey me?

Cecelia:
Maybe not.

The Pope:
Then go.

Ezell:
...Your Holiness?

The Pope:
I'm just a poor old man whose greatest wish is to spend the rest of his life in a soft rocking chair. How could I muster the effort to manage a young girl's travel plans?

Ezell:
But, Cecelia is...

The Pope:
Is what? Do you still think she's some hybrid of angel and devil, a saint who will usher in the Revelation?

The Pope:
Cecelia is just a little girl who wants to go outside and see the world, is she not?

Ezell:
......

The Pope:
You're still carrying your mama's guardian gun, right?

Cecelia:
Ah, I'm sorry! Should I leave it with Mister Ezell?

Cecelia:
But...

The Pope:
It's fine, my child.

The Pope:
The acquisition of a patron firearm is a solemn affair. It is supposed to require a grand ceremony, the presence of a guardian, the approval of a mentor, as well as lots of troublesome paperwork...

The Pope:
But, you aren't even of age to obtain a guardian gun. So, just take it with you quietly.

Cecelia:
Is that really okay?

The Pope:
I wouldn't dare say call this my boon to you. Each and every gun is a valuable asset to Laterano.

The Pope:
But, if this is the only keepsake a child has of her mother, I'm sure no one could oppose that.

The Pope:
Take it with you, my child. You may not have the physical ability to pull the trigger and take out a bad guy... but it will always remind you that wherever you go, your journey began in Laterano.

Cecelia:
...Okay, thank you, Your Holiness.

The Pope:
Ezell, go with her. Call it your long-term field mission.

The Pope:
Just remember to stop by every now and then.

Ezell:
......

Ezell:
Do I... really have the right to do that?

The Pope:
Of course you do. Is this not the choice that you made?

Ezell:
I will do everything in my power to fulfill this mission.

The Pope:
Look after Cecelia well.

The Pope:
Alright, now be on your way. Time waits for no man. When you get to be my age, all you think about is taking your next nap.

Cecelia:
Mister Pope...

Cecelia:
I promise to follow this path to the very end.

The Pope:
Oh?

The Pope:
In that case, I will pray for you.

Velliv:
Your Holiness, are you satisfied with this outcome?

The Pope:
I got to enjoy some sweets with them. I am satisfied with that.

Velliv:
The man has left, just as you instructed.

The Pope:
Should I have kept him around a bit longer? Maybe a piece of chocolate would've cheered him up?

Velliv:
Your Holiness... you're too soft-hearted.

The Pope:
No, Velliv, the dream of becoming torches in the cold night is doomed to failure. For all of us.

The Pope:
But, serving a functionary a hot cup of tea... that's something we can always do.

The Pope:
'This world is hostile to beauty...' May those who reject this aphorism find success.

The Pope:
It is time for us to move on to our next task as well. Now that the riots have subsided, let's convene the foreign envoys.

The Pope:
The Revelation is clear, I will do what I must.

Mostima:
That's not true, Fiammetta. You don't have to shoulder anyone's burden.

Fiammetta:
No, that is my choice.

Fiammetta:
I don't care what power he was lusting after, what secrets he was trying to uncover, what answers he was trying to find.

Fiammetta:
I don't care about his ideals, his lofty cause, who he redeemed, or who he guided.

Fiammetta:
I will not forgive him.

Fiammetta:
Not because of my beliefs, not because of Laterano, not because of the Pontifica Cohors, and not even the time that I've lost...

Fiammetta:
I will not forgive him, because––

Fiammetta:
Andoain, you betrayed the people who trusted you.

Andoain:
My old friends.

Fiammetta:
How come you're here in one piece?

Fiammetta:
How come even His Holiness can't...

Andoain:
How come...?

Andoain:
How come... you're asking me that again... The path was never there in the first place. What good does it do groping around in the nothingness?

Mostima:
Is this your penitence?

Andoain:
Penitence? No, I have nothing to repent... Where can I repent? There is no light, no path. Those who suffer must continue to suffer, those who grieve must continue to grieve.

Andoain:
There is no salvation, no paradise. This is Laterano, and it is the only thing that belongs to us.

Andoain:
If the light has always been a lie... No, not a lie... It's real, but not as we wished...

Andoain:
There has never been a light... let alone illumination...

Fiammetta:
What are you babbling about, Andoain?

Andoain:
Have I given up? Why would I be here if I had given up?

Andoain:
With a barrier this thick, how am I supposed to embrace them? How am I supposed to embrace them?

Andoain:
Maybe I am nothing more than a swindler peddling false hope... who deceived myself into believing it...

Andoain:
I don't understand. What is Its judgment? Where does It want me to go? Its very presence has already blocked my path...

Andoain:
Where shall I find my path?

Fiammetta:
Andoain! Wake up! Look who's standing in front of you!

Andoain:
Who... Ahh... Fiammetta...

Fiammetta:
Why are you losing your mind again?! Where did your honey tongue go, your righteous air? Have you lost your spine?!

Fiammetta:
How am I supposed to convict a husk of a madman? Take a good look at who's standing in front of you!

Andoain:
...I'm in Laterano, Fiammetta. I'm above the Basilica.

Andoain:
I'm glad to see you all again... No, I'm not glad at all.

Andoain:
......

Fiammetta:
Are you trying to get in the way?

Fiammetta:
You still dare to get in my way?!

Andoain:
......

Fiammetta:
Apologize, Andoain.

Fiammetta:
Right now. Get on your knees and apologize to Mostima and Lemuen!

Andoain:
......

Fiammetta:
Do you think you did nothing wrong?!

Andoain:
I have made countless mistakes.

Fiammetta:
You're still pretty damned smug, aren't you?!

Andoain:
God forbid.

Fiammetta:
Listen up, Andoain. I don't give a damn what your beliefs are, nor do I care if all your beliefs have gone to shit.

Fiammetta:
Lemuen forgave you. Mostima forgave you. Yvangelista XI forgave you. Even if all of Laterano forgives you... I will not.

Andoain:
I'm so sorry, Fiammetta.

Fiammetta:
I'm not the one you should be apologizing to.

Andoain:
If I had the chance, I'd probably do the same thing all over again.

Mostima:
Are you for real? You'd say that in front of Fiammetta?

Mostima:
And right now, you're not...

Fiammetta:
Very good, Andoain.

Fiammetta:
Take out your gun.

Andoain:
You know that won't accomplish anything.

Fiammetta:
You think I care about accomplishing something?! I in malam crucem! You think that if I kill you right here, Lemuen gets eight years of her life back?! Or that Mostima gets the whole rest of hers?!

Fiammetta:
Pedicabo ego te et irrumabo! Accomplishing something!

Fiammetta:
I want revenge for the sake of getting my goddamned revenge! Do you get that, Andoain?

Andoain:
Are you so completely obsessed, Fiammetta?

Fiammetta:
So what if I am?

Fiammetta:
I'll say it one more time, Andoain–– Take out your gun!
