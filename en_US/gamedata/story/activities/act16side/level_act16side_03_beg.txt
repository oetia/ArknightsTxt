Oren:
Oh, Fiammetta... Hm? Seems like you're in a bit of a mess.

Fiammetta:
None of your business.

Oren:
No need to get worked up. Care to sit down for a cup of tea?

Fiammetta:
Enough of your jokes. Why are you here? Mostima never mentioned you were our support.

Oren:
Well, Velliv didn't give me an official order either.

Oren:
And personally, I'm more than willing to help, yeah?

Oren:
Mostima says there's another group after the little girl, and you've already run into them. Is that right?

Fiammetta:
More or less.

Oren:
After I heard from the Notarial Hall that Ezell cut his signal, I figured you might get intercepted. If you were to get caught out by the enemy, we'd end up losing the girl, no?

Oren:
I don't know why Mostima isn't here to help you, but if she's pinned down, I figure I'll be doing her a favor.

Oren:
After all, it's not every day I get the opportunity to have the two of you in my debt.

Fiammetta:
A few hopeless stragglers can't stop me.

Oren:
'A cautious crew sails for ten thousand years,' Fiammetta. Velliv's going to have a hold over you at this rate.

Oren:
Oh, that's a Yanese proverb. In other words, safety is born of caution.

Fiammetta:
Stop trying to show off, Oren. You're so annoying when you talk like that.

Oren:
I'm not kidding. I at least got to express my goodwill. The rest is up to you.

Oren:
Or, do you perhaps need me to escort you, my sweet Fiammetta?

Fiammetta:
No need. Goodbye, Oren.

Fiammetta:
Executor Ezell, hand over the girl.

Fiammetta:
It is in your best interest to comply.

Ezell:
......

Ezell:
Your name is Fiammetta, right? Seniora Fiammetta, I have a request.

Fiammetta:
Let's hear it then.

Fiammetta:
No sudden movements. There's no telling how I might react.

Ezell:
I know it was suspicious of me to go against Richele's orders and turn off my terminal, but...

Ezell:
Believe me, I haven't betrayed Laterano.

Ezell:
The reason I didn't follow the Hall's exact orders was because I didn't want anything to happen to Cecelia... And, I made a promise to her.

Fiammetta:
And how is that my problem?

Ezell:
Please just let me accompany you to the Basilica with Cecelia. If the Lateran wants an explanation for this situation, wouldn't it be more convenient to have me around?

Fiammetta:
You're getting ahead of yourself. If you think you'll be able to influence how the Curia will handle this situation–– You'll want to disabuse yourself of that.

Fiammetta:
Going one step further... If you're thinking you could take the girl away if you don't like what the Lateran plans to do with her...

Fiammetta:
Not gonna happen. Not in your wildest dreams.

Ezell:
I wouldn't dare. I'm well aware of the Basilica's Gun-Knights.

Ezell:
I am a Lateran executor, after all. I was concerned before because I didn't know what was happening with Cecelia, or exactly who was after her...

Ezell:
Now that I understand, I will comply with your arrangements.

Fiammetta:
Alright.

Fiammetta:
Um... Your name is Cecelia? Can you walk?

Cecelia:
Ezell...

Ezell:
Cecelia, I can carry you, if you're too tired.

Fiammetta:
I'll carry her. You're too slow.

Cecelia:
(*whispers*) Mister Ezell, I...

Ezell:
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

Velliv:
Executor Ezell Pastore went to 7-265 Via Thervatius in Pagus Stevonus this morning to verify an identity, record a will, and retrieve a patron firearm.

Velliv:
Around noon, Ezell appeared in Stevonus Central Hospital, taking in an eight-year-old Sankta girl and departing in an unusual manner.

Velliv:
The resident of 7-265 Via Thervatius, Pagus Stevonus, Feoria La Porta, died of illness this morning and the body was moved to the Ecclesia Requietum.

Velliv:
Only one individual is registered to 7-265 Via Thervatius, and the census pagus also records only one individual residing there.

Velliv:
An investigation of twenty years of maintenance records at 7-265 Via Thervatius revealed that a basement had been added seven years ago, with contractor documents indicating that the space would be for storage.

Velliv:
This is a file photo of Feoria La Porta and surveillance footage of the girl that Ezell took to the hospital.

Velliv:
You must've already reached a conclusion about where the girl came from.

Velliv:
Additionally, according to the report submitted by Ezell this morning, Feoria La Porta did not leave a will or an advance directive. The reason is quite clear: she hoped to avoid contact with the Notarial Hall.

Velliv:
It is reasonable to infer that Feoria La Porta knew her time was short and sought to secure a future for her daughter.

Velliv:
It is currently impossible to determine whether Ezell is the object of Feoria La Porta's entrustment, but based on Ezell's background, the probability is low.

Velliv:
Combined with the information sent back by Fiammetta, the more likely trustee should be...

Velliv:
Astray.

Velliv:
Mostima, is this the reason you stayed behind in the Basilica?

Mostima:
Just temporarily.

The Pope:
Don't be so uptight, Vel. Cream puff?

Oren:
Phew. Luckily, we went for the more conservative option.

Oren:
It would've been awkward if Fiammetta walked in on me getting rid of the Notarial Hall's men.

Patia:
Enough of your excuses. I'd avoid saying too much to that executor, if I were you. Cecelia's already on the Guide's side.

Oren:
That's just one executor, Patia. Things haven't gotten so out of hand that I need to get personally involved.

Oren:
Plus, I think that executor's concerns are simple enough. He found the pity within him to cause his heart to waver, and couldn't bear to see a sweet little girl suffer.

Oren:
Now that we understand him, it's only a matter of time until he comes over, no violence necessary.

Oren:
If only Fiammetta hadn't shown up so soon...

Oren:
That is to say it's your fault for not stopping Fiammetta, Patia.

Patia:
I...

Oren:
Just kidding.

Oren:
But, I do take pity on that one's luck. What was a little old thing is now very complicated... That's what happens when you get ahead of yourself.

Oren:
Is this, too, a trial given to us by the great and mighty Lateran?

Patia:
Are you a believer again?

Oren:
A true believer wouldn't say something like that. Those sorts, who treat hardships as trials, they turn it all into... a blessing from fate?

Oren:
There are quite a lot of believers like that around the two of you, aren't there?

Patia:
I'd take them over self-serving Sankta like you any day.

Patia:
So, what's the plan now? Once Cecelia gets to the Basilica, is she going to come out again? Do we have some way to take her?

Oren:
One step at a time, Patia. If we're talking about not wanting Cecelia to step foot in the Basilica, I'm even less inclined than you.

Oren:
But, we haven't played all our cards, have we?

Oren:
Go tail Fiammetta, but not too closely.

Patia:
What about you?

Oren:
I've got plenty on my plate. Just found out that someone's looking for me too. Popularity isn't all it's made out to be, you know.

Patia:
Don't go inviting trouble for me.

Richele:
Alright, looks like the next clue of the chain is clear. What do you plan to do?

Federico:
I will go to him.

Richele:
Even though I have no doubts about your, uh, strength... you're dealing with a well-connected Legatus. It'll look pretty bad if you make something out of nothing.

Federico:
He is involved in this incident.

Richele:
We have to look into this precisely because he's involved, right? Sometimes, I envy the way you see things.

Richele:
But what if he doesn't know anything?

Federico:
I need to investigate to be clear.

Richele:
That's true. In any case, the fact that a Legatus is involved at all warrants looking into.

Richele:
What I didn't expect is that Feoria, an ordinary and reclusive Sankta, would provide us with so many leads. An undocumented girl, a Legatus...

Richele:
And... a Sarkaz.

Richele:
Hmm, you're leaving? Not even going to say goodbye?

Richele:
Well, alright then...

Richele:
Now that you're gone...

Richele:
Don't blame me, Oren. I can't stop Federico.

Richele:
I'll put in a report for you. That's about all I can do.

Fiammetta:
She's asleep.

Ezell:
She's exhausted.

Fiammetta:
You mentioned that you made her a promise. What was it?

Ezell:
That I'd help her find her mother.

Fiammetta:
Her mother? Wait, didn't Mostima say in the message that her mother is...

Ezell:
Yes, dead. Saw the body with my own eyes in the back of the Ecclesia Requietum's hearse.

Fiammetta:
Then, why'd you promise her that?

Ezell:
I didn't know, at the time.

Fiammetta:
And then? Did you tell her?

Ezell:
I did. But at her age, I'm not sure she understands the concepts of 'passing on' or 'death.'

Fiammetta:
Must've been tough for you.

Fiammetta:
And... don't look so upset. I don't think the Pope... will treat the girl too harshly.

Ezell:
Her name is Cecelia.

Ezell:
Seniora Fiammetta...

Fiammetta:
Just Fiammetta is fine.

Ezell:
Miss Fiammetta... I was thinking, after Cecelia goes to the Basilica, will she ever come out again...?

Fiammetta:
I can't promise you anything. But the way I see things, all else aside, she has a halo. That makes her a Sankta.

Fiammetta:
And when dealing with a Sankta, all must obey the Commandments, be it the Lateran Curia or the Notarial Hall. At least that's what I believe.

Fiammetta:
Even if she's undocumented.

Ezell:
Uhh... is that really the main issue?

Fiammetta:
Who knows? Might be possible to get her registered retroactively.

Ezell:
......

Ezell:
But, there's... something wrong with Cecelia's halo.

Ezell:
I'm not entirely sure how serious this whole mixed-blood Sankta issue gets... But at least the Legatus implied that Cecelia would be fine.

Ezell:
A lot of foreign envoys have been gathering in Laterano lately, right?

Ezell:
His Holiness has been preparing a major summit... I can't help but worry that Cecelia will be a target for someone trying to stir up trouble.

Fiammetta:
Sounds like you've really thought this one through.

Ezell:
Coming from the other angle, what would the Lateran Curia do to prevent that from happening?

Ezell:
Miss Fiammetta, I don't know if I should even be thinking about these things.

Ezell:
But I can't just not think.

Fiammetta:
You'll have to pardon me for being blunt.

Fiammetta:
But what's the point of worrying about all this? Is there any part of it you can actually control?

Fiammetta:
If you know that Cecelia is in danger, then you should also understand that for Cecelia, the Basilica is the safest place.

Ezell:
You're right.

Cecelia:
Nngh...

Cecelia:
Sorry, I fell asleep...

Ezell:
Did we wake you?

Cecelia:
N-No, I just...

Fiammetta:
Ezell, is that your stomach growling?

Cecelia:
......

Ezell:
Want me to buy you a donut, Cecelia?

Cecelia:
D-Donut? Okay! Thank you, Mister Ezell...

Fiammetta:
Don't worry, I'll go for it. I need a break, my arms are sore from carrying her around.

Fiammetta:
(*whispers*) There's no way I can handle her long-term, alright?

Fiammetta:
But don't do anything stupid, Ezell. I've got my eye on you.

Ezell:
You still don't trust me?

Fiammetta:
Oh, and turn on your terminal. You're not allowed to have it off.

Ezell:
Yeah, I know.

Cecelia:
(*whispers*) Mister Ezell, that lady was so mean to you before... I'm scared.

Ezell:
Don't worry, Cecelia. She's not a bad person.

Cecelia:
Mister Ezell... can't I go see Mamma? Can't I even say goodbye to her?

Ezell:
Um... Well, we need to take you somewhere else first, so you can be safe.

Ezell:
As for your mama... I'll tell you about her later. Let me... think about it first. Is that okay, Cecelia?

Cecelia:
Um...

Cecelia:
Do you hear that?

Ezell:
Hear what?

Cecelia:
Someone is singing...

Ezell:
Let's see... Oh, you're right! It seems to be coming from that cotton candy cart... But I'm surprised you could hear it with all the noise on the street. You have really good hearing, Cecelia.

Cecelia:
It's because I recognize that song!

Cecelia:
Mamma taught it to me!

Cecelia:
Um... I can't go off on my own, right?

Ezell:
It's okay. We can't go over there, but I can get the cotton candy cart to come over here.

Ezell:
Excuse me––

Serene Peddler:
Is someone calling us?

Merry Peddler:
Hum hum hum~♪

Serene Peddler:
You really like that song, don't you...? Hey, there really is someone hailing us. Let's head over there. If we can't get any info, let's at least make some money.

Merry Peddler:
All~ righty~♪

Cecelia:
Hello...

Merry Peddler:
Oh hello, little girl, would you like some cotton candy?

Cecelia:
Yes...

Ezell:
We'll get two, or actually, three sticks. This flavor here, this one here, and then the swirl. Is that alright?

Merry Peddler:
No problem.

Serene Peddler:
Three sticks, coming right up.

Cecelia:
Um, excuse me... What's the name of that song you were singing earlier?

Cecelia:
Mamma taught me the same song, but never told me what it's called...

Merry Peddler:
Huh? Your mama... taught you this song?

Cecelia:
Um, excuse me, the cotton candy! The cotton candy is coming out!

Merry Peddler:
Ahh, I'm so very sorry, just give me a moment––

Ezell:
Hold on, the compartment's about to overflow! Let me help you...

Merry Peddler:
Sorry, sorry!

Serene Peddler:
(*whispers*) Your hat!!! Your hat's caught!

Merry Peddler:
*rip*––

Ezell:
......

Serene Peddler:
W-Wait, don't get the wrong idea, she's a Caprinae...

Cecelia:
Miss!

Cecelia:
Your horns look just like Papà's...

Cecelia:
Are you also a Sarkaz?

Ezell:
––––––

Serene Peddler:
(*whispers*) Put it back on!!

Merry Peddler:
I, no, I'm... Little missy, you, you've got it all wrong...

Ezell:
......

Ezell:
A Sarkaz infiltrating Laterano... Are you also after Cecelia?

Fiammetta:
What happened, Ezell?

Ezell:
Miss Fiammetta, this particular individual... is a Sarkaz.

But there's another sentence that I dare not say.

Serene Peddler:
Tch... Guess we have no choice, now that it's come to this...

Fiammetta:
You've got guts, I'll give you that...
