Mayer:
Silence, you alright?

Silence:
I'm alright.

Silence:
Why are you over here now?

Mayer:
Cause you've been over here for ages. Just checking in.

Mayer:
Eep. That wine bottle there... you're drinking now?

Silence:
Just a little.

Silence:
Director Muelsyse?

Mayer:
She's still back there waiting for us.

Silence:
Where are you in the story?

Mayer:
Up until Anthony started trusting Kafka to help him. She also told me some stuff about what went down between Control and Saria.

Silence:
Did she now?

Mayer:
Want me to tell you?

Silence:
No. Not necessary for the time being.

Mayer:
You look like you're doing terrible. Was it some bad crap Director Muelsyse told you about?

Silence:
No... though it was, in a sense.

Silence:
I'm... I can't put it straight.

Silence:
My mind is in disarray. I have some regrets. I feel as though I may have done something I am not equipped to do.

Mayer:
You mean this whole breakout?

Silence:
Yes.

Silence:
I should apologize to you, Mayer.

Mayer:
What for?

Silence:
I shouldn't have gotten you involved. I was too cowardly. I couldn't bear it, and I told you about all this. I made you assume responsibility with me.

Mayer:
Whoa, I don't really mind, y'know. The fact you could trust me makes me pretty freakin' happy, Silence.

Mayer:
And I mean, really, all I've done is take a trip back to Columbia with you.

Silence:
Actually, there's something I haven't told you.

Mayer:
What is it?

Silence:
Behind this incident, behind HydeBro, is the Energy Section.

Mayer:
Huh? Energy?!

Silence:
You and the rest of Engineering are so closely tied with Energy, I'd been unsure whether I should tell you.

Mayer:
Oh... Hm, I'm fine, really. We're pretty tied up work-wise with Energy, yeah, but honestly, I'm not the world's biggest fan of their section.

Mayer:
Or more I'm, like, kinda terrified of Energy's director...

Silence:
What's the Director of Energy like?

Mayer:
Nngh? Haven't met more than a few times, but sometimes he comes over to our end just to see. He'll drop in on our meetings, too.

Mayer:
He opens his mouth and you go 'wow, he's a big, smart cookie,' but he gives off this kinda feeling like...

Mayer:
I don't know how to capture it. He, like, cares more about what our stuff can be used to make, or what it can be exchanged for, things like that.

Silence:
I see...

Mayer:
And, like, since Saria took all the blame and resigned, it feels like us and the Energy Section got, like, even more tied up in each other.

Mayer:
All these times some kinda weird work got scheduled and I couldn't even do any of my own crap.

Mayer:
And that's why I wanted a chance to send myself off to Rhodes Island.

Mayer:
Even if Closure's a little weird too, I'm way happier just doing my work at Rhodes.

Silence:
So that's it...

Mayer:
Anyways, don't worry about me too much, Silence. In fact, I feel like you've done something good. Right?

Silence:
Something good...

Kal'tsit:
This intel and analysis you have provided is extremely valuable. It compels me to note your viewpoint strongly, Operator Silence.

Silence:
In that case...

Kal'tsit:
But first of all, this intel's origins are clearly internal to Rhine Lab. Divulging internal intelligence to third parties without permission inspires me not to place trust in you.

Kal'tsit:
However, from your behavior, I can trust you are in no way an imprudent person. Therefore, I require an explanation.

Silence:
This is intel I arrived at through collection and analysis via my own personal channels. It has no direct relation to Rhine Lab.

Kal'tsit:
But your discovery of a matter like this should've prompted submission to internal channels, to be dealt with there. Rhodes Island has no capacity to adjudicate this incident.

Silence:
No. I had no expectation that Rhodes Island would be able to.

Silence:
I simply wanted to aid this person. I wanted to hear your viewpoint.

Kal'tsit:
Why mine? Or should I say, why Rhodes Island?

Silence:
As of now, I trust Rhodes Island more than I do Rhine Lab.

Kal'tsit:
What of Rhine Lab are you skeptical about?

Silence:
I don't know. I don't even know what it is I'm skeptical of.

Silence:
But I've come to work here for a very long while, now. I've seen with my own eyes what Rhodes Island is doing. I, at the least, KNOW what Rhodes Island is doing.

Kal'tsit:
What you see may not be what you get, Operator Silence.

Kal'tsit:
Moreover, it may be that you haven't noticed, but from your intel, it is very likely this Feline named Anthony was only immediately arrested the next state over as a setup by his father.

Kal'tsit:
In all likelihood, a situation they'd arranged long beforehand.

Silence:
But Anthony still hasn't been released to this day. He's already been stewing in that prison for six years. It's all the more likely he'll be in there forever.

Kal'tsit:
Why are you placing such importance on a person who has nothing to do with you?

Silence:
Because I want to see clearly, once and for all, just what kind of company the Rhine Lab I've served all this time is.

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
You may be disappointed.

Silence:
But it'll be far better than knowing nothing.

Kal'tsit:
You are greatly persuasive, Operator Silence.

Kal'tsit:
Rhodes Island cannot provide you any outward assistance whatsoever, but I can, from a personal standpoint, provide you my viewpoint.

Kal'tsit:
I hope you are able to maintain your notion from start to finish.

Silence:
What notion?

Kal'tsit:
The notion that you are doing something good.

Silence:
I'm starting to have some doubts. Is this truly something good I've done?

Mayer:
Huh? Why?

Silence:
I'm starting to worry, Mayer.

Mayer:
About what?

Silence:
In the past, I always believed that as long as I gave my effort to any problem, it'd always be answerable.

Silence:
But this time, I fear I've run against a problem I have no way to answer.

Mayer:
Because you can't solve it?

Silence:
Not that I can't solve it. It's that I don't dare to. I don't dare to pull it apart.

Silence:
Mayer, did Kafka ever tell you how she and I know each other?

Mayer:
Hm? Didja forget? She remembers she even mentioned it while talking to Mina.

Kafka:
Mina.

Mina:
Mm-hm.

Kafka:
Phew. Finally found a chance to talk to you. How's your results?

Mina:
Following what you said, I've been spendin' this whole time ascertainin' this prison's structure on the down-low. Already got a general grasp of it now.

Mina:
Helps the prison turnkeys're lax, but structure's tight. I feel like gettin' out's a pretty tall order...

Kafka:
No problem, Boblem. There's always a way.

Mina:
How's about your end, then?

Kafka:
I'm tapped in with Anthony. Turns out he had an idea for leaving in the first place, so we'll be following PLAN-A operations, helpin' him break out.

Kafka:
We'll treat the clinic as our secret base from here on. I told Dr. Domma there about you. Just head right over, and you'll be good.

Mina:
So that's it...

Kafka:
What? You're a snap away from meeting the big guy who's been on your brain. Why d'ya look so flat?

Mina:
I'm not. I've seen him from far away a bunch of times. I feel like the big guy's kind of different to the one who saved my family once.

Kafka:
Huh, I see. What did he used to be like?

Mina:
He used to be... a little more, ermm... cool?

Kafka:
That's a way to phrase it.

Mina:
Once after I learned he saved 'em all, I went to see him all secret. He was plenty more cheery 'n' open than he is now.

Kafka:
What way? Was he that kinda big, splashy guy? The kid with like ten or so bodyguards fannin' from his heels?

Mina:
No, no... um... he was like, a bit more... I'm not sure how you describe it...

Kafka:
I'm gonna say he was the rich kid then.

Mina:
Whatever, now he's really silent, I feel like, and he's never showin' emotion. It feels someways sad lookin' at him...

Kafka:
He got slammed in here for six years, after all. It'd do a number like that on even the cheeriest kid.

Mina:
I s'pose so...

Kafka:
So we just need to help him escape, and he'll be back to the way he was before, for sure.

Kafka:
More or less, right? Eh, I'd pass on him becoming a rich kid again, though!

Mina:
I think it'd be swell.

Kafka:
Okay, okay. You lost me now.

Mina:
If you wanna put it like that, you're losing me. You said you only came to help Anthony 'cause a friend trusted you to. Why would you go so far to help your Silence friend?

Kafka:
Because I think Silence is a good person.

Mina:
What kind of reason is that?

Kafka:
Mmnnn... me and Silence know each other from one time she went out to do field work.

Kafka:
Me, I was used to pretty grubby methods to do my stuff. So happened I bumped into her.

Kafka:
Guess I made some pretty un-small trouble for her back then. I drove her an inch from giving up her business there.

Kafka:
But things worked out. And in the end, I got to know her. Can't knock 'em until you knock 'em, right? Do they say that?

Kafka:
Anyways, after that, she'd show me some work pretty often. Felt like she was hoping I'd do things proper like she did.

Mina:
She sounds like a real good person.

Kafka:
Sure as heck is. Always felt Silence saw this world a little too rosy, though.

Kafka:
Turns out there's a lotta things people who think like her can't ever make headway on.

Kafka:
Okay, maybe Silence is a little naive. But she's so smart. And she ain't stubborn. So I've always felt she's fine the way she is. I wanna be friends with her.

Kafka:
I may have plenty of friends, but I only got one like Silence. I really cherish her, y'know.

Mina:
So that's why you went to prison to help her?

Kafka:
Eh. That's not all of it.

Kafka:
Another part's I once heard about this prison. Definitely been curious about this place.

Kafka:
Another 'nother part's... 'cause Silence kinda changed this time.

Mina:
You mean her gettin' you to help someone jailbreak?

Kafka:
Mmm. And she begged me to help her get all this corporate intel together. I picture how Silence used to be and it doesn't fit with her doing this kinda stuff.

Mina:
Hm... did somethin' happen to her, you think?

Kafka:
I dunno... ever since she left Columbia and went to some shop called Rhodes Island, I never saw her again. Been stuck with pen-palling.

Kafka:
Never really made clear why she left Columbia either... but, yeah, I guess something musta happened.

Kafka:
In any case, Silence seems real dead-set on this, so I figure I'll help her out proper for once.

Mina:
Kafka. Hear me out. You might be a real good person yourself?

Kafka:
Eh? You're saying you saw me as some stinker?

Mina:
I seem to remember you good-Kafka-bad-Kafkain' me straight into prison with you, y'know...

Kafka:
Ahah. Imagine if I asked a stranger outta nowhere 'hey, let's get locked up together.' Don't matter how I ask, they'd think I was going nuts, right. So I needed a little more of an approach, yannow?

Mina:
Yep. I cannot out-words you. Forget it.

Kafka:
Heehee. No, but anyways, I just don't think this is really a 'good or bad' kinda thing.

Kafka:
It's like how you're going all neck or nothing for the guy who once saved your family, but what you're actually doing is breaking him outta jail.

Kafka:
If saying it's for a friend makes it kind for sure, then maybe more of my friends are good people than the ones who just put on the looks.

Kafka:
But people who do bad stuff even though they have good intentions... how do you call them good people, huh?

Mina:
Hm... I think you have a point.

Kafka:
They coulda just admitted they were bad people from the start, probably.

Jailer:
......

Kafka:
Oop, here come the jailers. Work's 'boutta start. Catch you at the clinic later.

Kafka:
You'd better hustle. Who knows, these people might get scrappy again soon.

Mina:
Mm-hm. Kafka, you take care too.
