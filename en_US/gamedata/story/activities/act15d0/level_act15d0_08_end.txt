Anthony:
Son of a...!

Jesselton:
It's no use, Anthony.

Jesselton:
Ms. Robin, I'm afraid I've underestimated your fighting prowess. I must say, I'm taking a liking to you more and more by the minute.

Jesselton:
How about it? Help me now, and I will forgive all that you've done.

Robin:
How about no?!

Kafka:
What's with this guy's hand? It's got so hard after it turned black!

Jesselton:
Oh, let me introduce you to my Originium Arts. I can control iron. And I've also received a few modifications to my body.

Jesselton:
When you attacked just now, it felt as though you hit an iron plate, didn't it?

Jesselton:
That isn't just my Originium Arts at work.

Jesselton:
Beneath my skin, I have what I suppose you can aptly call the crystallization of technology, courtesy of Rhine Lab—a tiny metal plating.

Jesselton:
Well, I'm afraid I don't know what its proper name is, but it's strong enough to greatly reduce the impact of your attacks.

Kafka:
Hold on, you're from Rhine Lab?!

Jesselton:
Unfortunately, I'm not.

Jesselton:
In any case, I'm surprised you're able to put up such a fight despite those shackles.

Jesselton:
Looks like it's time to get serious.

Robin:
His hand... turned into a blade...

Jesselton:
Did you know, Mr. Anthony?

Jesselton:
Ever since I arrived at the prison, ever since I first laid my eyes on you, I've felt a sort of mismatch.

Jesselton:
You are doing your damnedest to control yourself, to make yourself seem harmless, and to make yourself look well-mannered.

Jesselton:
But you're strength incarnate.

Jesselton:
From that moment onward, I've been waiting for this to happen.

Jesselton:
So that I can tear off that well-mannered facade of yours and unleash the violence hidden underneath—

Anthony:
I'm sure I didn't disappoint.

Jesselton:
Not at all. You opened my eyes.

Anthony:
You have no right to judge who I am!!! *Roar*!!!

Jesselton:
I'm not here to judge. What I'm trying to say is you're much less of an eyesore now.

Jesselton:
Using your teeth too, huh? Tsk, tsk.

Jesselton:
I'm sorry to say your teeth won't be able to tear into me.

Anthony:
...Dammit! Dammit!

Jesselton:
Anthony, my friend, is there really all that much you can accomplish outside?

Jesselton:
Will you be able to save your parents? Your family?

Jesselton:
Let me tell you. You'll have nothing once you step out there.

Jesselton:
You're living quite the life here in prison. Even the warden has to kowtow to you.

Jesselton:
I may have said I could've killed you long ago, but it wouldn't have been a walk in the park if you didn't go on this little excursion.

Jesselton:
Why go through all that trouble? Isn't life in prison plenty comfortable?

Anthony:
On July 24th six years ago, I was heading to a dinner party when, all of a sudden, a bodyguard told me something had happened back home and my father told me to run.

Anthony:
I had no idea what had happened. I didn't even had the chance to say goodbye to my parents before I went on the run.

Anthony:
I was arrested when I made it to Ironforge.

Anthony:
I thought that was all there was to it, but it didn't take long after I was put in prison for me to find out that wasn't the case.

Anthony:
The way I'm treated here is not how criminals are usually treated. I realized right away that my father probably arranged for my imprisonment.

Jesselton:
Well, what a coincidence. I think so too. But if that's what you think, wouldn't you say that's all the more reason not to betray your father's wishes?

Anthony:
My father's wishes?

Anthony:
Looks like you really enjoy looking down on people and trying to plot them out, Jesselton.

Anthony:
Has anyone ever told you how petty you are?

Jesselton:
I've been told that before, indeed.

Jesselton:
But I'm afraid how petty I am has nothing to do with your prison break.

Anthony:
I could live a comfortable life here. I could even turn it into my own little kingdom.

Anthony:
But what would that get me? It would only make me the prisoner with the most freedom.

Anthony:
I've lived here for six years, and there was nary a moment when I didn't want to step outside.

Anthony:
I want to leave not because I want to prove how amazing I am. I want to leave because I need to figure out just what had happened back home. I need to tell the ones responsible for my family's downfall that we're not done yet!

Jesselton:
To tell the truth, that impassioned speech is really rubbing me the wrong way.

Jesselton:
But no big deal. Whatever the case may be, you aren't getting out of this place alive.

Jesselton:
I may not be able to take you down, but I've stalled you long enough. The other guards should be here soon as the lockdown ends, too.

Jesselton:
You did well. Your friends did, too. This isn't your fault.

Jesselton:
It's just that most of life in this world ends up unsatisfactory.

Jesselton:
Unfortunately, this is as far as you go.

Jesselton:
Listen. Here comes the reaper.

Robin:
So this is it...?

Kafka:
Tsk, what should we do...?

???:
Sorry to disappoint, but the reaper isn't coming just yet.

???:
On a different note, Anthony, you are way too loud. I could hear you on my way here.

Jesselton:
Who... are you?

Jesselton:
Hm? You...

???:
I have to hand it to you. Even I was a little surprised by your plan.

???:
It took me a good while to stop those other guards.

Kafka:
Huh? Where've I seen you before...?

Jesselton:
Hold on, you...

Jesselton:
Rhine Lab Defense Director, Saria!

Saria:
Right, I remember you, Jesselton.

Jesselton:
I'm honored to be remembered by someone as esteemed as you.

Saria:
Not a lot of resumes make it to my desk.

Jesselton:
I remember the moment you told me I didn't get the job too.

Jesselton:
But first, I'm curious. What is Her Highness the Defense Director doing here in a prison?

Saria:
You needn't worry about that.

Saria:
All you need to know is that this is where it all ends for you.

Jesselton:
Where it ends for me?

Jesselton:
No, no, no. It seems you're mistaken about something, Director Saria, or should I say just Saria?

Jesselton:
I heard your ability isn't all that dissimilar to mine, but before I even had the chance to find out, you'd already slammed the door in my face.

Jesselton:
For all these years, I've wondered whether you're actually stronger than me.

Jesselton:
Looks like we have the chance to find out now.

Saria:
Hmph.

Kafka:
Her hand changed color too!

Robin:
It's so white... beautiful...

Saria:
You're right. Your Arts are rather similar to mine.

Saria:
However...

Saria:
I've told you before, Jesselton.

Saria:
You're too fixated on the moment and you lack perseverance. I don't need anyone like that working for me.

Jesselton:
......

Saria:
You're too small-minded.

Jesselton:
Dammit...

Saria:
If this is how you are, there's no way I could accept your application.

Saria:
Out of the way.

Jesselton:
Saria!!!

Saria:
I told you to get out of the way.

Jesselton:
Sa...ri...a...

Kafka:
S-So strong...

Kafka:
I heard the Defense Director was pretty badass, but this is on another level...

Kafka:
Thank God I've never crossed her.

Anthony:
Thank you very much, M-Ms. Saria.

Saria:
It's okay. If you can still walk, now's the time to do it.

Saria:
Before that, I have a question I need to ask you, Anthony Simon.

Anthony:
Please. Go ahead.

Saria:
Have you heard the name Ferdinand before?

Anthony:
Ferdinand... I heard that name from my father.

Saria:
So it was you, Ferdinand.
