Barton:
Urgh, god dammit, where in the world did my card key go...

Barton:
Did I flush it while taking a dump?

Jailer A:
Chief Barton, what's wrong?

Barton:
Mind your own business!

Jailer A:
Y-Yes, sir!

Jailer A:
Tsk, stuck-up asshole...

Jailer B:
I'm guessing... someone probably pissed him off.

Jailer A:
Heh, probably Anthony.

Jailer A:
I don't really know what's going on, but it seems like someone's trying to kill him.

Jailer A:
Barton likes to brag about how perfect the prison is. This is gonna keep him on tenterhooks.

Jailer B:
We're prison guards, you know.

Jailer A:
Eh, it's not someone getting killed that I'm happy about. I just like seeing him so peeved.

Jailer A:
Besides, let's be honest. We've seen Randal and Barton do so much dirty work over the years.

Jailer A:
If you ask me, I think Randal knows who sent these hitmen in here. He's just turning a blind eye because he's in their pocket.

Jailer B:
Maybe.

Robin:
Gah...

Anthony:
Don't move, Robin.

Anthony:
Don't make me kill you.

Robin:
......

Kafka:
Well, damn, Robin. You're good. Even I didn't have you pegged for a spy.

Kafka:
I think you just might have a gift for this gig.

Anthony:
Wait a minute. What are you holding?

Kafka:
Whoa, that a bomb switch?!

Anthony:
Kafka, lower the tower right now!

Kafka:
Whoa! It's burning!

Anthony:
Hurry!

Kafka:
I forgot which one's which!

Kafka:
And I kinda get the feeling these probably aren't gonna work anymore!

Kafka:
Oh, there we go! Should be this one!

Kafka:
Please! Please work!

Kafka:
There!

Kafka:
It's not moving! Is the thing broken?!

Anthony:
Robin, why are you doing this?

Robin:
I...

Kafka:
It's going down!

Barton:
Dagnabbit!

Barton:
Whatever, I don't even remember when was the last time I was up there.

Barton:
Just need to have Randal make me a new one.

Barton:
Tsk.

Jailer A:
Chief Barton, you...

Barton:
What?

Jailer A:
What are you doing?

Barton:
I'm heading upstairs to see how those damned fools are doing with the clean-up work!

Jailer A:
What... What happened here?!

Barton:
What in the name of... What's going on here?!

Anthony:
Hold onto something, Kafka!

Kafka:
Anthony, over there! Robin's gonna get thrown into the elevator!

Anthony:
......

Anthony:
Hold on tight, Robin!

Robin:
Why...

Anthony:
Save it for later!

Anthony:
Get ready!

Kafka:
Anthony, you and Robin okay?

Anthony:
I'm fine. I got Robin.

Anthony:
Seems like the whole prison's power went out. It's pitch dark here.

Anthony:
This is an opportunity for us.

Kafka:
Yes.

Kafka:
It feels like the tower crashed straight through the floor.

Kafka:
We're probably at the second floor basement. Still some distance away from the clinic.

Anthony:
Right, we should get going before the jailers get here.

Anthony:
Robin, are you okay?

Robin:
......

Robin:
I-Is it really a good thing that I'm okay?

Anthony:
It is.

Anthony:
Don't let it get to you.

Anthony:
I did tell you before you could keep trying to kill me.

Anthony:
If you think you betrayed me for what you did, let me tell you this—

Anthony:
I'm afraid none of us are close enough to talk about trust just yet.

Kafka:
Heh, not even me?

Anthony:
Not even you.

Kafka:
Oh, come on, that's cold.

Anthony:
Wouldn't you say it's more problematic to completely trust a person after just a few months?

Anthony:
Of course, I am a little disappointed, but that's all.

Anthony:
Nonetheless, I'm curious. I can tell you weren't acting when we were working together. You can't fake those emotions.

Anthony:
Why did you do this, Robin?

Robin:
......

Robin:
My father. He made lots of money, and he was nice to me. I'm proud of him.

Robin:
But one day, his company went bankrupt.

Robin:
And he's been a failure ever since.

Robin:
So he changed. He started drinking a lot, and he got angry. He hated everything around him.

Robin:
My mother left him. He was heavily in debt, and in the end, went into the hospital with liver problems, and so many other complications I don't even get the details of.

Robin:
My mother tried to talk me into moving in with her.

Robin:
But I never forgot how well my father used to treat me.

Robin:
I wanted to do something for him. So I gave up my hobbies. I tried taking on all kinds of jobs, but the medical bills kept coming.

Robin:
Then, one day, someone came to me. He said he could give me lots of money. I just had to kill someone for him.

Anthony:
And I'm the target.

Anthony:
I see. I can't offer you anything, and that's why you made this choice.

Robin:
No, he's been watching you here, dressed as a jailer. His name is Jesselton.

Robin:
After you made me the offer, he found me and told me—

Robin:
The very last thing that the Simons did was destroy my father's company.

Anthony:
My goodness.

Anthony:
In that case, not only should I not hold this against you, I must apologize.

Robin:
No, don't apologize. That isn't what I'm trying to say.

Robin:
It's not like that, Anthony.

Robin:
I knew I was doin' wrong. I knew I shouldn't do it.

Robin:
But I gave up.

Robin:
I didn't know what I was supposed to do, otherwise. I just didn't know.

Robin:
I'm tired. My mother wanted me to make a choice, my father wanted me to make a choice, life wanted me to make a choice, Jesselton wanted me to make a choice, and even you wanted me to make a choice.

Robin:
I don't wanna make any choices. I don't wanna judge what's right or what's wrong, good or bad. I just don't want to.

Robin:
I'm sick of it! Why do I have to choose?!

Anthony:
But, you know, Robin, you can't just hand off your decisions.

Anthony:
You have to think everything through and make your own choices. Then, you need to take responsibility for each of those choices.

Anthony:
Otherwise, you'll never be able to take your fate into your own hands.

Anthony:
This is the most important thing I've learned during my years here in prison.

Anthony:
Strength is important, and so is intelligence, but the most important trait of all is courage. The courage to make your own decisions and pay the price for them.

Anthony:
I'm afraid of making wrong decisions myself, but I can't let that get in the way of making decisions at all.

Anthony:
I used to think I had no one to rely on because I hadn't found anyone reliable, but I've come to realize there is no one we can truly rely on anywhere in this world.

Anthony:
No one but ourselves.

Robin:
......

Anthony:
I'm sorry I didn't notice your pain in time, Robin.

Anthony:
I must reiterate. What you've done almost ruined my escape plan. That's why I won't forgive you so easily.

Anthony:
Nonetheless, as someone who has suffered a similar situation, I hope you can forget about all this for the time being.

Anthony:
You must scrutinize yourself and think about what it is that you want to do.

Robin:
What it is... that I want to do...

Anthony:
Domma's room is right up ahead. You have all the time you need to think.

Robin:
I understand if you don't completely trust me, but I told Jesselton everything about your plan. He's definitely waiting for you somewhere up ahead.

Anthony:
I know.

???:
Oh, you don't hafta worry about finding me. I've been waiting for you right here.

Anthony:
?!

Robin:
It's coming from Domma's room!

Anthony:
You don't mean...?!
