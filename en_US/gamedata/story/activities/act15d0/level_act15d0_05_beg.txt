Silence:
I'm back.

Muelsyse:
You alrightie, Ms. Silence?

Silence:
I'm alright. In fact, perhaps I should thank you.

Muelsyse:
What for?

Silence:
Not much.

Muelsyse:
Alright. Well, then, shall we continue?

Silence:
Where did you leave off?

Muelsyse:
Anthony offering Robin the olive branch.

Muelsyse:
I was just talking with Ms. Mayer about how excellent his methods are.

Silence:
I feel you may simply be overthinking it.

Silence:
Perhaps he didn't think so hard about it at the time, wanting to give Robin his pure goodwill?

Muelsyse:
Hmm. Honestly, I can't deny that sort of possibility.

Muelsyse:
But if he was just a simple, kindhearted person, he'd have no way of living through this world, Ms. Silence.

Silence:
Forget it, I shouldn't be discussing this with you. Where did Mayer leave you?

Muelsyse:
Once Kafka and Anthony wrapped up talks, Anthony finally decided to break out.

Muelsyse:
We got to Robin waking up in the clinic, and Anthony inviting her onto the jailbreak team.

Muelsyse:
I have to say, Ms. Silence, I'm genuinely curious as to where you got this lead on Anthony from.

Silence:
From my mentor's things.

Muelsyse:
Hm? Really, Director Parvis got stuck into this too?

Silence:
No, it's been an age since I had any direct contact with him.

Silence:
Moreover, I'm afraid he may not even know about this.

Silence:
Ever since I left Rhine Lab, I've sorted through a great deal of intel I'd never once cared about before.

Silence:
And within that, I caught onto the Simons' tail.

Muelsyse:
Oh?

Silence:
This family's destruction was very rapid. Moreover, some data were camouflaged very well, so to many people's eyes, it'd seem as though there was no change in the figures at all.

Silence:
But camouflage always tends to leave a trace. A statistical form here, a stray datum there. As long as you compare in detail, you'll find the problem that arises within.

Silence:
I was only giving those figures a try at first, just to see, and never expected I'd come across anything like this.

Muelsyse:
You only realized by chance... no, I guess it was inevitable.

Muelsyse:
But why the sudden interest in sorting out all that data?

Silence:
Because my trust in Rhine Lab, and my mentor, has started to wane.

Muelsyse:
The 'Diαbolic Crisis?'

Silence:
No, not just that.

Silence:
The 'Diαbolic Crisis' precipitated Saria's departure. What happened after that, I presume you understand even better than I do, Director Muelsyse.

Muelsyse:
I see, now.

Muelsyse:
Wowie, I was just asking without thinking. Should you really have come out with all of this?

Silence:
Isn't it what you wanted to hear?

Silence:
I'm not good at covering things up, Director Muelsyse. So once I thought it through, I decided to be candid with you.

Silence:
I may not be fond of my mentor at all, but he said something that stuck in my mind ever since—

Silence:
What makes the schemers sweat is open talk.

Muelsyse:
......

Muelsyse:
Seems like I'm the villain here, huh.

Silence:
No. My time living at Rhodes Island has taught me one thing, and it's that not everyone who goes against you should be considered an enemy.

Silence:
I believe that you're no villain... and neither is Saria.

Silence:
It is only that, you and I, and Saria, have no way to reach a mutual understanding.

Muelsyse:
Ahah. Maybe, yeah.

Silence:
Director Muelsyse, do you still want to hear more?

Muelsyse:
Of course! We were just getting to the good part.

Muelsyse:
Aww, but the story's pretty much nearing the end here, isn't it?

Muelsyse:
I mean, at that point, Anthony's whole jailbreak crew was more or less in place, right?

Muelsyse:
Anthony himself, Domma the mortician, Kafka, temp worker Mina.

Muelsyse:
Add in Robin, and everyone pulls together to kick ass and pull a prison break, right?

Silence:
No. Things aren't that simple.

Muelsyse:
Eh?

Silence:
No-one said Robin joined Anthony's team.

Muelsyse:
Eh?

Silence:
It's true that after that, Kafka, Domma and Anthony started working out how to pull off the jailbreak, and Robin was even included in it.

Silence:
But things were not that simple.

Muelsyse:
What happened?

Silence:
Do you still remember the helper you mentioned HydeBro sought out?

Muelsyse:
I do. What about him?

Silence:
He found Robin.
