B-Zone Prisoner B:
......

B-Zone Prisoner B:
Hmph!

B-Zone Prisoner B:
!

A-Zone Prisoner:
Euggh...

Robin:
(This prisoner's fierce! Knocked all the others down in just a few hits.)

B-Zone Prisoner B:
...Go to hell.

Jailer B:
......

Robin:
(This jailer's a mighty one too. She's just guarding, though, seems like. I wonder why...)

B-Zone Prisoner B:
Heagh!

Jailer B:
...Hm.

Robin:
(Crud, the jailer's down...)

Robin:
(Just me left. But if I end up fighting with him here, it's gonna be a mess to explain after.)

B-Zone Prisoner B:
And you.

Robin:
(Think, c'mon. Is my only option to throw fists?)

B-Zone Prisoner B:
......

Anthony:
Hmph.

B-Zone Prisoner B:
You're fast.

Robin:
(Anthony... rescued me?)

Anthony:
I might not know who you are, but you shouldn't be doing this. Not this, right in front of my eyes.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Heh heh, death's knocking and you still care about other folk. You're a real gentleman, Mr. Anthony.

Robin:
(When did he—?!)

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Heheh. Here, miss. Don't be scared of me. Just blame it on your rotten luck.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Relax. Asides from Anthony, we don't wanna kill nobody. You just take a lie-down.

Robin:
(Shit!)

Robin:
Guh...

Robin:
(He got me...)

Robin:
(I can't—think clear...)

B-Zone Prisoner A:
...let's...you a warm welcome...Anthony...

Anthony:
...dead...

Muelsyse:
I didn't expect you to be this good of a cook. Wow.

Mayer:
Hm-hmm! Betcha didn't.

Muelsyse:
Anyway, she got caught up in another assassin's attempt and lost consciousness, then...?

Muelsyse:
That must've sucked.

Mayer:
Yeah, unlucky her.

Muelsyse:
So how'd this assassination pan out?

Muelsyse:
We know Anthony must've won, but this was an attempt on his life in a prison. Couldn't have gone without comment.

Mayer:
Yup. But because Robin was out during that time, we have to go from Kafka's side.

Muelsyse:
Ooh, but didn't Kafka get knocked out by that convict too?

Mayer:
Oh, she sandbagged that one. So she says.

Muelsyse:
Ah... okay, that adds up. It does seem like her style, yep.

Anthony:
Talk. Whose people sent you?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Heh... heh... you wouldn't... know.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
......

Anthony:
...He's out.

Anthony:
These people really were...

Anthony:
...Fine. Thinking about it now won't do anything. Let's see how these prisoners are first.

Prisoners:
......

Robin:
......

Anthony:
Looks like none of them crossed the river.

Kafka:
......

Anthony:
And then this girl...

Anthony:
I don't know who you are, but you helped me back there...

Anthony:
Thank you, girl stranger.

Kafka:
You can call me Kafka.

Anthony:
Hm? You're not out?

Kafka:
Uh. Don't move. Just shift a bit to the right. Block the monitors.

Anthony:
Is this okay?

Kafka:
Golden. Surveillance shouldn't see me now.

Kafka:
Lucky for me, I checked around while I was cleaning the rooms.

Anthony:
Who are you?

Kafka:
I told you, call me Kafka. I'm here to help you.

Kafka:
But this is a real snafu. I was gonna leave you a slip of paper and call it there. Didn't expect those guys to suddenly go off.

Anthony:
What in the world is happening?

Kafka:
Not the right place to talk about that. Know anywhere good?

Anthony:
...The jailers should be coming over to see what the ruckus was. We can go to the clinic. That'll work.

Barton:
What in blue blazes?! Anthony, what the hell are you doing?!

Anthony:
That's what I'd like to ask, Barton.

Anthony:
These prisoners snuck in with the intent to kill me.

Anthony:
What the hell are you doing?

Barton:
What?!

Jailer B:
It's the truth, Superintendent Barton. I witnessed Mr. Anthony fight off two inmates.

Barton:
What? Weren't you watching them?!

Jailer B:
The two of them knocked me out. They were quite... no, very strong.

Barton:
Rgh. Good for nothing.

Barton:
How do you want me to explain all this to the Warden?!

Anthony:
Let's get a grip on the present first, Barton.

Anthony:
These two are the assassins. You can deal with them.

Barton:
A—hem. Right, but Mr. Anthony, you see, we can't just take you at your word for all of this...

Anthony:
I know.

Anthony:
I've suffered minor injuries. I need a trip to the clinic first. They knocked everyone else unconscious. It might behoove you to send them all to the clinic too.

Anthony:
Once we're there, I will explain things in fine detail.

Barton:
Alright, alright.

Barton:
What are you bunch navel-gazing for? Throw these two bodies in the morgue, and drag all of THEM with you!

Jailer:
Y-Yes, sir!

Jailer:
Sir!

Domma:
The jailers're all gone, Anthony.

Domma:
What happened? I saw them all looking perturbed some.

Anthony:
I'd like to know too.

Anthony:
Alright. This place is safe, young Kafka.

Anthony:
Domma is my friend. If I could call anyone in this prison trustworthy, it'd be her.

Kafka:
First off, drop that 'young.' I'm just some random li'l shortie.

Anthony:
Apologies, Miss Kafka.

Kafka:
Man, okay, you. For a prisoner, you're politer than all the people outside.

Domma:
This's how Anthony is. He don't hold back courtesy for anyone.

Kafka:
Yeah, I get it. You look like a haymaker, but you've got manners for days too. Not surprising everyone else in here thinks you're a juggernaut.

Anthony:
You flatter me.

Anthony:
Well, then. My turn to ask the questions. You're apparently here to aid me. That means you know where my assassins came from, I suppose?

Kafka:
Uhh... before that, I need to ask you something first.

Anthony:
Please do.

Kafka:
You know what your family—or I guess your dad is the one Simon Co.'s named after—anyway, do you know exactly what happened there?

Kafka:
As long as you do, I can explain things a lot simpler.

Anthony:
My father was detained on more than ten charges. I know the circumstances couldn't have been simple, but I've had no time to find out concretely.

Kafka:
Okay, you know, yeah. That's good enough for me. Um, Simon Co., uh... thanks to ille... il... whawazzit?

Anthony:
Do you mean, 'illicit?'

Kafka:
Yeah, that! Illicit, smuggling, of Originium, goods! Anyway, the company got shut down, and the core members all went to prison.

Kafka:
So your whole family's serving in Bunkerhill City right now.

Anthony:
......

Domma:
Anthony...

Anthony:
...I'm alright.

Anthony:
I prepared myself to hear this a long time ago.

Anthony:
I'm already happier than you could believe, knowing they're not dead.

Anthony:
Alright. Who sent them?

Kafka:
HydeBro.

Anthony:
HydeBro. So it was you.

Kafka:
Lemme just think. What did Silence say... Right, your family. The Simons. Were competing with them across some kind of line.

Kafka:
You were camping 50% of the profits each over this. And there was plenty of friction. So they always wanted to just camp your share too.

Kafka:
And then they did it. Pretty simple.

Anthony:
...HydeBro.

Anthony:
I heard my father mention that name often. I even visited their company as a guest once.

Domma:
They did all of this over a bit of selfishness...

Anthony:
I'd heard of similar events before. I just never expected it'd happen around me.

Domma:
Anthony. Are you alright? Need me to use my Arts, settle your mind some?

Anthony:
No, thank you, Domma.

Anthony:
I told you, I prepared myself for this long ago. I didn't expect the reality to come so sudden, that's all.

Anthony:
I believe you, Miss Kafka. I think there's no reason you'd have to deceive me about this.

Anthony:
Seeing how things are, those assassins ought to be from HydeBro. Why only come at this point?

Kafka:
That, I have no idea at all. But judging by my experience, that wasn't the last of them just now.

Kafka:
They've sent a whole bunch of people in to take you out for sure, so, uh, we should probably call this the very beginning.

Anthony:
......

Anthony:
How about you? I presume you're not here just to help fend these killers off for me, are you? What's your objective, Miss Kafka?

Kafka:
Me? Mmm... it's kinda tough to explain fast, but let's say this: someone trusts me to help you break outta here.

Anthony:
......

Kafka:
You do wanna get out and take revenge, right?

Kafka:
You got a life sentence. And it's the kind without parole.

Kafka:
If you wanna leave this place, then you've got one choice, and that's—jailbreak.

Kafka:
And that's why I'm here to help.

Kafka:
Obviously, if you don't wanna peace out and you're gonna stay here forever, it's not like I'm gonna force you to go.

Domma:
Jailbreak... but no soul has ever made a clean escape from this prison.

Kafka:
Eyy. Say that if you want. But you can't knock it till you try it, right?

Anthony:
...You've been in this prison for a good while now, Miss Kafka.

Kafka:
Hm? Yeah, sure have.

Anthony:
Then you should have heard some things about me.

Kafka:
Yup. They all say you're the most powerful prisoner, and the most free. Pretty much everyone thinks you're strong as heck.

Kafka:
I think you're pretty strong too, right now. Staying calm in times like these.

Anthony:
But fact is, that's not what's happening.

Anthony:
Even with all this supposed 'charisma' I have, as a prisoner, I can't bend the jailers, let alone the warden. I should never have earned my current standing.

Kafka:
Eh, that's true enough. But you earned it now, so hey.

Anthony:
In reality, what I've earned is the turnkeys' favor.

Anthony:
At least, what little I know is that the warden himself said it. He told them to be 'slightly nicer' with me.

Anthony:
All these years, I've had suspicions. After I reached Ironforge City, I was arrested. Then I came to this prison. Did my father arrange for this from the start?

Anthony:
Foreseeing something, and sending me here in advance.

Anthony:
Such things have always spun in my mind.

Kafka:
Oh, Silence mentioned that too. She said it was just one possibility, though.

Anthony:
Silence. Is that the name of your backer?

Kafka:
Uh... whelp, whatever. Yeah, it is.

Anthony:
I'll be sure to thank this friend afterwards.

Anthony:
Anyway, it's just one possibility as you say. If I want to know the reason for sure, I'll need to get out. This is something only I can shine a light on.

Domma:
Anthony, is it really alright to tell her this?

Anthony:
It's fine. I believe you for the moment, Miss Kafka. Thus, I'm willing to level with you.

Anthony:
Even if you didn't show up—even if I'd long since gotten used to life in this prison—I've still yearned, incessantly, to leave here.

Anthony:
I can obtain most of what I want in here. But not since the beginning have I found the faintest outline of how to get out.

Anthony:
So in truth, I should be the one asking you, Miss Kafka.

Anthony:
Please, help me break out.
