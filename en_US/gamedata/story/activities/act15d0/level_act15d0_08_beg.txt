Jesselton:
Mighty big ruckus you've caused, Mr. Anthony.

Jesselton:
Had I not known all about your plan in advance, I'm afraid not even I could've stopped you.

Anthony:
You're Jesselton?

Jesselton:
That's right. I'm Jesselton.

Jesselton:
I'm sure you've noticed we've passed by each other in the prison a couple times, but allow me to introduce myself again.

Jesselton:
My name is Jesselton Miller, the very last obstacle to your prison break charade.

Anthony:
Where's Domma?

Jesselton:
Right here.

Prisoner A:
......

Domma:
Anthony, I'm sorry.

Domma:
I was waitin' here for you. I didn't expect this guy to barge into the clinic with the prisoners...

Kafka:
Domma...

Jesselton:
This is such a gloomy place. It would be unbecoming of me to let a beautiful lady wait here all by herself.

Jesselton:
That's why I figured I'd offer her my protection.

Robin:
Mr. Jesselton...

Jesselton:
Oh, Ms. Robin, it looks like I was expecting a little too much from you. What a disappointment.

Jesselton:
Or perhaps you never tried to kill him in the first place?

Robin:
I...

Anthony:
She failed, and your lackeys couldn't hurt me.

Jesselton:
Yet you spared her life. I must say, you are a fine gentleman, Mr. Anthony.

Anthony:
Save it.

Jesselton:
Very well. Let us get straight to the point.

Jesselton:
Mr. Anthony, if you don't want this young lady to die, please step over here.

Kafka:
......

Jesselton:
Ms. Kafka, I would appreciate it if you would stay right there.

Jesselton:
I can tell you're the opportunistic kind. Please try not to do anything that would put Ms. Domma in harm's way.

Kafka:
Hmph.

Anthony:
......

Jesselton:
Yes, just stand right there.

Jesselton:
All of you, surround him.

Domma:
Anthony, don't listen to him!

Anthony:
It's okay, Domma. We are going to save you.

Jesselton:
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Anthony. It's admirable that you are able to stay calm even in such a precarious situation.

Jesselton:
I'm sure you know what it is that I want, and you also know that I won't spare you out of compassion.

Jesselton:
Here's my suggestion. Abandon the lady, abandon your affectations, and come fight me.

Anthony:
You're wasting your breath.

Jesselton:
I wonder how long you can keep this up.

Jesselton:
And you, Ms. Robin.

Robin:
Eh?

Jesselton:
I would like you to kill Mr. Anthony. After all, you still have a job to do.

Jesselton:
It doesn't matter what kind of agreement you've made with Mr. Anthony or if you've had a change of heart, for whatever reason.

Jesselton:
If you want the money, and if you want to save your father, then this is your last, best hope.

Robin:
......

Robin:
I...

Jesselton:
Why the hesitation? Did Anthony promise you a blank check? Or have you grown soft on him after all this time?

Jesselton:
Last chance, Ms. Robin.

Robin:
I... I...

Jesselton:
Think of your father. Think of how your life is in tatters. Think of your future, your wish.

Jesselton:
If I were you, I wouldn't hesitate.

Anthony:
What are you trying to do?

Jesselton:
What am I trying to do?

Jesselton:
Isn't it obvious? If all I wanted was to kill you, I've had plenty of chances here.

Jesselton:
But that would be a li'l bit boring, wouldn't it?

Jesselton:
I've never found killing someone all that much fun, Mr. Anthony.

Jesselton:
But I really enjoy those moments when a person is faced with no choice but to abandon their past.

Jesselton:
That is why I lured Ms. Robin here. I long to see her change. I crave for her fall.

Jesselton:
And I thirst for your change as well. I thirst for the moment you finally lose your cool and bare your fangs, all for the sake of your family, your goals!

Jesselton:
I mean it, Mr. Anthony. Take off your gentleman's facade.

Jesselton:
Think of your family. Think of all you've been through, the humiliations you've faced. Think of the reason you're breaking out of this prison.

Jesselton:
Do you really want to die here?

Jesselton:
Do you really want to throw your life away for a woman you've only known a few years?

Jesselton:
Stand up, Mr. Anthony. Push Ms. Robin aside, forget Ms. Domma, come at me and kill me!

Anthony:
Not everyone out there is like you, Jesselton.

Jesselton:
You should know that you aren't all that special either, Anthony.

Jesselton:
I'll give you five seconds, Ms. Robin. If you don't act, I'll do it myself, and you'll die here with him.

Jesselton:
Five.

Jesselton:
Ms. Robin, you have yet to pay off your father's medical bills, and Mr. Anthony is penniless.

Robin:
Anthony, I...

Jesselton:
Four.

Jesselton:
Mr. Anthony, your parents are having a miserable time in prison. They're being ostracized.

Anthony:
Father, mother...

Jesselton:
Three.

Domma:
Anthony, don't worry about me! You can't die here!

Prisoner A:
Hmph!

Domma:
Gah...

Prisoner A:
Guess what, bitch? You ain't killing yourself on my watch.

Domma:
Ro...bin... don't...

Jesselton:
Well, Ms. Domma is quite a bit more fiery than I expected. How admirable.

Jesselton:
Alas, it didn't go as she planned.

Anthony:
Jes-sel-ton.

Jesselton:
Now that's the face I want to see, Mr. Anthony. Wonderful.

Anthony:
......

Jesselton:
I'm curious. What is it that fuels your conviction?

Jesselton:
Do you think your death can buy my sympathy for everyone else here?

Jesselton:
Are your principles worth that much to you?

Jesselton:
Perhaps you still have a card up your sleeve?

Anthony:
I've done much to betray my principles in this prison.

Anthony:
I sweet-talked the jailers, stuck up for Barton, fought those I didn't want to fight, and lived a life I didn't want to live.

Anthony:
This has nothing to do with principles.

Anthony:
This only has to do with me.

Anthony:
I won't sacrifice Domma for my own ends. That's all there is to it.

Jesselton:
Even though your family is still waiting for you?

Anthony:
You have no right to talk about my family.

Jesselton:
Even though you have revenge to take and questions you need answered?

Anthony:
None of that is more important than the life of a friend.

Jesselton:
Even if it ends up killing you?

Anthony:
Even if it ends up killing me.

Robin:
Anthony...

Anthony:
You have to think everything through and make your own choices. Then, you need to take responsibility for each of those choices.

Anthony:
Otherwise, you'll never be able to take your fate into your own hands.

Anthony:
You must scrutinize yourself and think about what it is that you want to do.

Robin:
Anthony...

Jesselton:
How regrettable.

Jesselton:
Well then. Two.

Jesselton:
One.

Jesselton:
Ms. Robin, I understand your struggle, but you have a decision to make.

Robin:
Anthony.

Anthony:
No matter what you end up doing, don't regret your decision, Robin.

Robin:
Right.

Prisoner A:
Gurghh!

Robin:
Anthony, leave Domma to me!

Prisoner B:
Tsk! You prick!

Kafka:
Heh, you two sure kept me waiting!

Prisoner B:
When did you...?!

Prisoner B:
...Euggh...

Robin:
Anthony!

Anthony:
*Roars*!!!

Jesselton:
So this is the trick you had up your sleeve.

Jesselton:
You knew Ms. Robin was on your side?

Anthony:
Perhaps your offer wasn't enticing enough.

Jesselton:
Are you sure about this, Ms. Robin?

Jesselton:
From where I'm standing, you have chosen a path that has no future.

Robin:
It's true that if it wasn't for the Simons, my father wouldn't have turned out like that, but it's his fault for not getting back up on his feet.

Robin:
I knew that. I just didn't want to accept it.

Robin:
And I... really don't want to do that either.

Robin:
Anthony promised to come up with something to raise money for my father's medical bills.

Robin:
But that doesn't actually matter.

Robin:
I've decided I'm not going to kill Anthony, and even if he doesn't help me, I'll come up with something else myself.

Robin:
And if my father dies before I get the money, then I...

Robin:
Then I'll kill myself and apologize to him in hell.

Robin:
That's my decision.

Jesselton:
......

Jesselton:
Beautiful. Beautiful indeed.

Jesselton:
What a beautiful resolve, Ms. Robin.

Jesselton:
I suppose you've made your decision. You want to turn your back on our agreement because of that resolve.

Jesselton:
Very well. Who am I to blame you for that? I should applaud you for making that decision, even.

Jesselton:
That said, I still have to point out one thing.

Jesselton:
When I said this path had no future, I didn't mean you won't have much of a future after your little jailbreak.

Jesselton:
I mean it all ends right here and now.

Jesselton:
There isn't a future where you make it out of this prison alive.

Anthony:
I guess we'll have to see about that.

Jesselton:
No, no, no.

Jesselton:
I have to admit. You are very strong, Mr. Anthony.

Jesselton:
As for me, killing and violence aren't exactly my thing.

Jesselton:
That's why Ms. Domma was only the first step in my attempt to stop you from 'seeing about that'.

Jesselton:
As for the second stepâ€”

Anthony:
Ugh... agh...

Kafka:
Waagh!

Domma:
Anthony, Kafka, are you two okay?

Anthony:
I'm... fine.

Jesselton:
You haven't forgotten the shackles on you, have you?

Kafka:
Dammit, this guy's thought everything through.

Jesselton:
I appreciate your compliment, Ms. Kafka.

Kafka:
You asshole, you've been lying to Robin from the start!

Jesselton:
No, no, no. I just like to have more than one option.

Jesselton:
Had Ms. Robin gone through with the deal and succeeded, it would've saved me quite a bit of trouble.

Jesselton:
And if she failed, as you can see, I've prepared a fall-back for her.

Jesselton:
You can't say I planned for all this without putting myself in her shoes.

Kafka:
Easy for you to say, but you dragged her into this mess.

Jesselton:
Haha, I never denied I wanted to see her struggle, did I?

Jesselton:
However, Ms. Kafka, you are very much in the know yourself. Think about it. Do you think she could've raised enough money for her father's surgery, had I not dragged her into this mess?

Jesselton:
I think it's extraordinarily unlikely.

Kafka:
Hmph.

Jesselton:
See? You can't argue with me on that.

Anthony:
Hmph... I have to admit. She has a lot more to gain... by helping you out.

Anthony:
But she didn't help you.

Anthony:
And that's more than enough for me!

Anthony:
*Roars*!!!

Jesselton:
Still trying to fight despite the circumstances?

Jesselton:
Very well, then allow me to personally tear apart that last delusion.

Robin:
Anthony, I'll back you up!

Kafka:
Tsk, I ain't quite as strong as Anthony, y'know...

Kafka:
Huh... You guys watch out! His hand...

Kafka:
His hand turned black!

Jesselton:
Ahh, how heartwarming.

Jesselton:
To think I get to crush this emotional get-together...

Jesselton:
It just fills me with delight, Anthony!
