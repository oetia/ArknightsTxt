Muelsyse:
Oh, so we're finally at the part where the actual jailbreak happens.

Muelsyse:
It feels like we skipped over some details, but this sounds a lot more complicated than I imagined.

Muelsyse:
Haghhh... I'm getting a bit sleepy.

Mayer:
Oh, me too.

Mayer:
How about I make everyone some coffee~?

Silence:
We're almost to the end.

Muelsyse:
I know, I know.

Muelsyse:
But I already have a pretty good idea of what happened after that.

Muelsyse:
All the groundwork was laid, so they just had to wait for the day of the actual breakout.

Muelsyse:
But on the day of the jailbreak, someone was missing, am I right?

Silence:
That's right.

Silence:
In the end, they decided they would escape during cleaning duty at C-Zone, while the prison is docked at Nulaiteburgh.

Silence:
But Robin didn't show up at the appointed time.

Silence:
After all, they didn't know that Jesselton, the puppetmaster here, already knew all about their plans.

Silence:
As for Robin, she was waiting for them up ahead...

Kafka:
Well, things are just a li'l bit wonky right now, but why don't we go over the plan?

Kafka:
Just like what we're doing right now, we'll give the prisoners and jailers what for while we're here to clean up the cells...

Anthony:
Yes.

Kafka:
Then, before the guards even have time to react, the two of us are gonna head to the top of the tower, sink this bad boy to the ground, and cut the power.

Kafka:
Domma's already waiting for us down in the basement. We just gotta regroup with her and head inside that tunnel we dug.

Kafka:
After that, all that's left is to change into those work outfits that Mina got us.

Anthony:
I've been wondering about this, and I somewhat doubt it, but do we really have clothes that actually fit me?

Kafka:
Relax, Domma actually sewed something up special for you!

Kafka:
If one outfit's not big enough, just sew two of 'em together.

Kafka:
Be sure to thank her.

Anthony:
Of course.

Jailer:
Nng!

Kafka:
Smell! Ya! Later!

Anthony:
You seem rather excited, Ms. Kafka.

Kafka:
Hehe, breaking out of a prison is so much fun! 'f course I'm excited

Kafka:
It's just...

Anthony:
Right, how come I haven't seen Ms. Robin around?

Kafka:
......

Jailer A:
Look what we have here, all old faces on today's cleanup crew. Saves me the headache of having to go over this again.

Kafka:
Right~

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Officer, what should we do if one of us tries to off Anthony again?

Jailer A:
What, you get dropped on the head?

Jailer A:
What do you think you just got frisked for?

Jailer A:
None of you can take on Mr. Anthony barehanded, not by a long shot.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Heh, I sure want to see you take on Mr. Anthony. Give me a holler when the fight gets started. I'll be rooting for ya.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Piss off, I ain't talking to you.

Kafka:
......

Kafka:
(What's going on? Why isn't Robin here?)

Kafka:
Hey, A-Zone buddy, where's Robin?

A-Zone Prisoner B:
You B-Zoners can kiss my... Oh, it's you, Kafka.

A-Zone Prisoner B:
No idea, ain't seen her around. I'm here to do her work.

Kafka:
......

Jailer B:
Enough talking.

Jailer B:
A-Zoners, with him. B-Zoners, come with me.

Kafka:
Tsk, ain't got time left.

Kafka:
Sorry, Robin, you're just gonna have to blame yourself for not showing up at the most important moment.

Anthony:
We've come too far to turn back.

Anthony:
We'll apologize to her if we ever see her again, but we need to go now.

Kafka:
Yes.

Kafka:
So this is the main control room...

Kafka:
Whoa, all this dust!

Anthony:
......

Anthony:
Watch out!

Kafka:
Eh?

Robin:
......

Kafka:
Robin?! What are you doing here?

Robin:
I have a backup card.

Kafka:
A backup? When did you...

Robin:
......

B-Zone Prisoner A:
......

B-Zone Prisoner B:
......

Anthony:
Stand back.

Anthony:
...We're in a hurry. We don't have the time to talk.

Anthony:
Let's get this over with quickly.
