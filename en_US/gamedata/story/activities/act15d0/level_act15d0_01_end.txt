B-Zone Prisoner A:
Get'cher ass on the ground!

A-Zone Prisoner:
Gah, sleaze...

Kafka:
Waaait, whoah, what even happened? Why're we duking it out now?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Thought I told you to go hide, Kafka. Whaddaya over here for?

Kafka:
Aw, gawd, I'm fine. Just tell me what's going on, and make it slick.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Hah, just take a look. Infected and Non-Infected don't see eye to eye most times, hey? So we split into two sides and brawl.

Kafka:
I mean, yeah, that happens for sure, but the jailers don't care?!

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Well, I want you to look at them careful.

Jailer A:
*Clicks tongue* Sure do love a good inmate fight.

Jailer A:
We hit the jackpot with today's shift.

Jailer B:
Hahah, right you are.

Jailer B:
This is the moment. The only joy working in this hellhole.

Jailer B:
Get their asses, A-Zoners! I'm watchin' you!

B-Zone Prisoner A:
You see that? They're living it up like no one else here.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Plus, the side that wins gets slightly better eats for the next while.

Kafka:
So this is all their fun? What's stopping us from just not fighting?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Not fighting? Kafka, you know how I got slammed up?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Took the scruff of everyone who looked down on me, and I socked 'em!

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Hey, Kafka. I reckon, all the places in the goddamn world, this is the only one where you can bust Non-Infected jaws and the fuzz can't even be assed to slap you on the wrist.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Beat someone to death? You get locked in for a while.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Besides, if you're really gonna die, you're gonna die. Who's scared of that in prison?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Beh, I'm done. You get it. I'm gonna go back and make hay. You find somewhere and stay low!

Kafka:
Beh yourself. You're lookin' down on Kafka, you know.

Kafka:
But man. I guess the Infected and the Non-Infected still live the same old clash in here.

Kafka:
Not just living it, even. Idea's gone mutant. Supermutant.

Kafka:
I've seen a thing or two outside, but I've gotta admit, if this ain't a first for me... If Silence was watching this, she'd be sick to the bone.

Kafka:
But sorry, Silence, 'cause I'm different. Heheh.

Kafka:
Messier the sitch gets, the more I like it.

Kafka:
You fight your thing, and I'll go see what pies I can't get my fingers in. That gets me ready for the next bit...

Kafka:
Yeuch, who sneaked their leftovers out for a box lunch?

Kafka:
Why's there a sock here...?

Kafka:
I guess that's what you get in a real prison. Y'all do what you're meant to, huh. Not finding anything I could really use though...

Kafka:
Buuut...

B-Zone Prisoner:
Drop dead, dirtbag!

A-Zone Prisoner:
Drop dead yourself!

Kafka:
Ooh, they're going at it. And the long-timers here don't play fair, either. They've been making all sortsa weapons on the down low.

Kafka:
Come on, get madder. Then drop something for me. Heheh.

???:
Ngh!

B-Zone Prisoner:
I got a stray one here, heh-heh-heh...

Kafka:
Aw, nerts, that girl's in trouble!

Kafka:
Maybe I oughta go help...

???:
......

B-Zone Prisoner:
Heh, heh...

Kafka:
Oops. She was hiding something up her sleeve, looks like. Interesting, interesting...

???:
What's going on here?!

Jailer A:
Superintendent Barton, sir! The prisoners are fighting!

Barton:
And you're sitting there watching? You ain't stoppin' them?

Jailer B:
Oh, Superintendent. Time's up?

Barton:
I don't give a hoot which way the time is, it's our duty as jailers to manage the prisoners!

Jailer A:
Yes, sir.

Jailer A:
Hey, you lot! Superintendent says it's time to quit it!

B-Zone Prisoners:
*Columbian slang*

A-Zone Prisoners:
*Columbian dialect*

Barton:
Urgh. I've said it before and I'll say it again. This is prison. Not your consarned battlefield.

Barton:
Y'all should be workin' proper. Actin' proper. Only way your moms, pops 'n' buds out there'll see you a day sooner. You hear me?

Barton:
I'm tellin' you this for your own good...

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Tch. Here we go again.

Kafka:
Wow, there's a couple marks on you. Y'alright?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Right as rain. Scratches! And I got to smash in a few A-Zone dirtbags for the trouble. Heheh, fine deal to me!

Kafka:
And it winds down like this every time?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
You mean Barton?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Yeah, more or less. He's the jailers' Super. Always shows up at times like these, puts on the vaudeville and hits the brakes. Then says some meaningful crap.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Especially moments like now when the place's stopped over at a city, the warden's gone and he acts like he's lord of the prison.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Dropped on his head as a kid.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
But it ain't every time this happens, I'll tell you that.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Plenty of times it don't stop for nothin'... I'd say most of the time, actually. Not that often it's over when over says, like today.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
But when it just won't end, you'll see Barton call in his safety.

Kafka:
His what?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Yup. There he is.

???:
......

Kafka:
Anthony?!

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Looks like you really do know him.

Kafka:
I mean, I've only seen him all dressed up before...

Barton:
You oughta learn from Mr. Anthony's example here.

Barton:
He might be a prisoner, but he esteems rationality, and he does not make his first resort violence. In his downtime, he likes to read. Write. Listen to records. Mighty fine boy!

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Bleuch.

Kafka:
You don't like Anthony?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
No, no, no, don't get me wrong, Kafka.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Ain't no-one in this prison who'd cross Anthony.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Usually, he's just like Barton said. Good to other folks. But we all know he's the biggest, muscliest goddamn shot in this place.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
They say when he came into prison, first thing he did was go and beat every last guy in C-Zone into line.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Damn right. And anyone else from C-Zone barely gets to meet us, but he's the real thing. Swell as a bell. A-Zone or B-Zone, everyone falls in with him.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Yeah. I'm just barfing having to look at Barton.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Listen to him. You think he's praisin' Anthony right now? He's mocking him.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Anthony's the only guy he can't lift his head against, but he needs Anthony to wrangle us, so this is the only way he can do it.

Barton:
We are Mansfield State Prison. State! Prison. We are a pilot penitentiary with special approval from the capital. We will serve as a shining example to the other states.

B-Zone Prisoner B:
Tch. We're a crowd of convicts. Example your face...

Barton:
In short, I hope you can now reflect on yourselves. Reflect for my sake!

Barton:
Let's go, Anthony. You've got an hour of hittin' the books today.

Anthony:
Hm.

Kafka:
So usually you don't even see Anthony?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Usually, I guess?

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Timetabling for the serious offenders is outta step with ours, and most of the time they're just staying in the C-Zone tower.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
What, you wanna see him?

Kafka:
Mayhaps I do.

Kafka:
I wanna talk about something with him. Obviously, not something the jailers can know about.

B-Zone Prisoner A:
Don't worry, I get'cha. If you wanna have a little heart-to-heart with him, it's not like you don't have a shot...
