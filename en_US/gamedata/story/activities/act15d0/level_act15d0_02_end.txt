A-Zone Prisoner A:
Auuggh-gh-gh-gh...

Robin:
Grit your teeth. It'll be fine in a flash.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Wraaaaaaggghhhh!

Jailer:
What the hell are you yelling for?! Can it!

Jailer:
If you're injured, go down to the morgue. Quit hollering here.

Robin:
Sorry about that. They're lined up something fierce over there. I'm just giving him some emergency aid first. It'll be fine soon enough.

Jailer:
*Spit*.

Robin:
He meant to say the clinic, right? Why the morgue?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Agh. 'Cause they're next to each other. Doc and mortician are the same person, too.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Weirds anyone out, I swear. Forget the jailers. Even if we're smiles and sunshine, we don't really wanna go near there.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Only, after the gang fights, there's nowhere else to go. Gotta get treatment there.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Over time, folks just end up calling that whole end the morgue.

???:
Do you need some help?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Eep! Domma, Miss, wh—whatcha doin' over here?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Uh, I was just makin' all that up, I, uh...

Domma:
You're okay. It don't really get to me.

Domma:
But this do. Need to come over to the clinic?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
N—nah, this young lady here helped dress it fine.

Robin:
Mm. Leave it to me.

Domma:
Your bandaging skills ain't half bad. Leave it to you I shall.

Robin:
Yep.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
*Huff*...

Robin:
That scared of her?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Scared, alright... To her credit, she's saved more people than I can count. But she's a real oddity. Just don't wanna get close to her, simple as that.

Robin:
I see.

Robin:
Alright, try moving your arm.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
...Phew. Much better.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
You've got fast technique, Robin. What'cha used to do?

Robin:
Used to... I used to work for a private security firm.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Private security firm? Ain't those pay big bucks?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
And you carry yourself good. Can't even imagine what someone like you does to end up in the slammer.

Robin:
All went downhill after my Pop lost his job. Spent all his time drinking. Gave his liver issues. Med bills came in real expensive. I took a risk, and...

A-Zone Prisoner A:
I see, yeah. Tch, darn. You ain't had it easy at all.

Robin:
You?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Me? Heh, I was a business guy. Wife 'n' her lover wanted to get rid of me, snatch my assets. End of it all, they took hell to me, and I killed 'em to save my life. Simple as.

Robin:
......

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Anywho, I owe you one.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
I've been here for lord knows how many years. I know a bit about everything that goes on. If you got any questions, ask 'em to me.

Robin:
I've seen a few folk from A-Zone or B-Zone enter the C-Zone tower from time to time. How'd they get in?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Huh? Oh, them.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
They got dragged over to C-Zone to clean the big guy's room.

Robin:
Cleaning?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Yep. 'Sides from jailers, there ain't actually much people on the staff.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Might be an official slammer, and it seems the paychecks ain't bad, but nobody wants to work at a prison. Much less a giant nomadic prison like this, roving the barrenlands all day long.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
If they ever wanna do something inside the prison, it's when they stop over at a city. Get a few people to come in, get it done while they're stopped.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Can't get it done in time, and they just gotta come with. Wait until someone's sent out so they can send 'em back, or just take 'em to the next city and send 'em off there.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Last we stopped at San Sophie City, they hired a bunch of decorators. Been half a month since we left, and they're still working at it.

Robin:
Ah. So they weren't the prison's, those workers all over the place.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Yep. See, one there right now.

Kafka:
(Whispering)

???:
(Whispering)

Jailer:
Ms. Mina, what are you doing over here now?

???:
Ah, excuse me. I'm lookin' for a WC. Made a wrong turn on accident.

Jailer:
Ah, no problem. Superintendent's said, long as you don't go anywhere important, no worries going where you go.

Jailer:
But you! Don't stand there if you got nothing, scram back to your quarters!

Kafka:
Eeeyup—

A-Zone Prisoner A:
See? They ain't the prison's folk, but they act like the center of the universe. Warden's given orders they're to eat good, drink good.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
So the jailers all used to sidestepping everywhere look damn near constipated seeing any of them. I think it makes 'em look pretty cool, heh-hey.

Jailer A:
Grr! And why're you two chatting?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Hey-hey, sir. Got a newbie. Cut us some slack?

Jailer A:
Hmph. I'll give you five more minutes.

Robin:
How did you have that...

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Heh, I've been here a while. You'll always find your way to something.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
If you want some, I can give you a little.

Robin:
Don't need it. More interested in the prisoners entering C-Zone...

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Yeah. There's never really any staff around, but gotta have someone to blame for the hygiene and all that.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
You don't think it's these jailers who do it, do you?

Robin:
So those bunch get hauled off to clean the place up?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Yep.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Not just C-Zone. Same goes for everywhere else. Us inmates clean the whole damned prison.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
But dang, if it ain't a cushy job.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
You don't need to work in the factories, and you get to wander all over.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Sometimes you get to be in the passages only the jailers go, drinking up the scenery.

Robin:
Passages?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Heh, I guess you wouldn't know. Second floor's got this corridor. Only staff get to go through it. You can see the whole view from there.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Been there once before. Whew. Darn good sight.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
But the jailers in here are some real lowlifes.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
The jailer watching me that time pointed out this big stone marker outside, told me they'd stood it specially for the convicts.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Just asked for who exactly without even thinking. And he said, for all those convicts who 'escaped.'

A-Zone Prisoner A:
There's been people in here who really did escape on their ownsomes, and some they let out deliberately.

Robin:
Why?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Because they all die out on the barrens, in the end.

Robin:
...Couldn't you break out while they stop at a city?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Hey. You think no-one else had that idea before you? Every time they stop over, every single jailer's on max alert, cranked to eleven.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Even a guy like Anthony wouldn't be able to make it out.

Robin:
Anthony...

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Heh. But in my opinion, he doesn't even need to make it out.

Robin:
Why?

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Anthony's a prisoner, but who doesn't respect him? When the jailers talk to him, they're scared to even breathe.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
He doesn't make trouble, but his strength and reputation goes for miles.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Did you know building that underground library was his suggestion to the warden?

Robin:
That's some clout...

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Heh. Don't blab about this everywhere, but we all feel in private, if Anthony wanted to stay in this prison forever...

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Then that'd be nothing to do with the warden. Anthony's the real master of this place.

Robin:
......

A-Zone Prisoner A:
But it sounds peculiar, don't it? How'd a fella like Anthony end up in prison? And he's spent so long here, yet nothing's happened.

Robin:
......

Jailer:
You've been chatting for far too long. Back to your quarters.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Yes, sir, right away, now.

Jailer:
Your wounds're no problem, then.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Eh? No problem, none. Robin wrapped me up real good. Much better.

Jailer:
......

Jailer:
Then don't you dawdle.

Robin:
(Just now, that one took a glance at me...)

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Heh, that jailer actually gave a shake about me. What in Sam Hill.

A-Zone Prisoner A:
Well, that's that for now. You got anything, come find me again.

Robin:
Got it. Thanks.

Robin:
...Pop, looks like Anthony's a pricklier problem than I'd heard.

Robin:
Who are you?

???:
Did you receive a sum of money today?

Robin:
You're 'Generous J?'

???:
Correct. Go on and get your father's treatment.

???:
Of course, if you want to make your own life better with it, that's no problem either. In fact, I personally recommend you do so.

Robin:
...Why are you giving me money?

???:
It's in the name. I'm generous.

???:
Though I regret to tell you, if you want to treat your pappy with that money, it's not gonna be enough.

Robin:
...What do you want me to do?

???:
You're smart, Robin, miss. I like dealing with smart people.

???:
Here, I'll lay my cards out to you. I want you to—

???:
Enter Mansfield State Prison, and kill someone.

Robin:
Mansfield? I've heard that's a prison you never get out of.

???:
Don't you worry about that. As long as you can do it, I have the means to let you out.

???:
You can think it over, Miss Robin.

Robin:
I know this is risky beyond hell, and I know things look bad.

Robin:
But... sick as you are, I'll do what I can.
