Prelim MC:
Well, if this isn't a shocker! Who could have known this would happen during the highly-anticipated scrimmage preliminaries?!

Prelim MC:
Two non-participants who joined the fray out of nowhere ended up our final victors!

Prelim MC:
Mr. Pancho, is something like this going to fly?!

Pancho:
Ahem... Indeed, this rarely happens in our competitions, and, in principle, we prefer our contestants follow the competition's rules.

Prelim MC:
It's very regrettable, then...

Pancho:
However.

Pancho:
It isn't so bad for something like this to happen once in a while.

Prelim MC:
Right! Ahem, it's very regrettable, then! I am afraid we have bad news for our other contestants!

Lin Yühsia:
Heh, looks like the MC's pretty good at thinking on the fly. He was about to say we were disqualified.

Ch'en:
Maybe.

Ch'en:
Looks like we barged into some competition venue.

Ch'en:
If I remember correctly, this is the Smash Splash Preliminaries.

Prelim MC:
But don't forget the whole point of the competitions is to bring joy to the people!

Prelim MC:
Although the two of them did not go through the proper procedures to join our competition, thanks to their extraordinary skills and flawless teamwork, they survived until the very end!

Prelim MC:
What a fantastic turn of events! Let us give these ladies a huge round of applause for their performance!

Lin Yühsia:
He said our teamwork was flawless. Were we even working together?

Ch'en:
I sure hope not.

Ch'en:
*Sigh*... how did this happen?

Lin Yühsia:
Dad, what's the story behind this invitation...?

Rat King:
Another year, another letter, eh? That woman doesn't know when to give up.

Lin Yühsia:
What woman? Give up on what?

Lin Yühsia:
Is this something I should tell Mom?

Rat King:
Settle down. It's one of the mayors from that commercial city alliance. Some ten years ago, Wei Yenwu was still in the mood to go visit himself. These days, they only talk to each other via Messenger.

Rat King:
But she's not one to take no for an answer. She sends both of us invitation letters to go visit around this time every year.

Lin Yühsia:
Commercial alliance... The one in Columbia?

Rat King:
No, it's in Bolívar. You heard of it before. She's the mayor there.

Lin Yühsia:
Dossoles... Candela Sanchez?

Lin Yühsia:
I heard that place is a money sink... Are you not going?

Rat King:
It's halfway across the world, and what would I do there? My arms and legs are too old for that kind of abuse.

Rat King:
Besides, even if I were in the mood for a trip, it's meaningless if Wei Yenwu doesn't go.

Lin Yühsia:
That's right. The one they want to butter up to is the Chief of Lungmen, Mr. Wei, and it's true that he doesn't have the luxury to take a trip now, given all the responsibilities on his shoulders.

Lin Yühsia:
Please don't sell yourself short either, Dad. If you were to take a trip, we wouldn't have anyone look after the flowers at the shop, and the uncles would have one less person to play chess with.

Rat King:
Seoi neoi. So that's how you compare me to Wei Yenwu.

Rat King:
Our cities have a trade agreement. If Wei Yenwu had his heart set on going, he'd go. He's sick of Dossoles, and it's certainly not worth visiting.

Rat King:
And if Wei Yenwu isn't going, then I'm not going either.

Lin Yühsia:
Okay, I understand. I'll toss the invitation, then.

Rat King:
Hm? A phone call from Lady Fumizuki?

Fumizuki:
Mr. Lin, it's me.

Rat King:
Lady Fumizuki, to what do I owe the pleasure?

Lin Yühsia:
A phone call from Lady Fumizuki? I'll give you the room...

Fumizuki:
Is that Yühsia? Ask her to stay. This has to do with her as well.

Rat King:
Yühsia, stay.

Lin Yühsia:
Alright.

Fumizuki:
Mr. Lin, I'm sure you, too, received the invitation?

Rat King:
As always. Is something the matter?

Fumizuki:
Personally, I am quite fond of the idea of going on a holiday there, but you know how Yenwu is. You couldn't find a lazier person if you tried.

Rat King:
Of course. But it seems you have a different idea?

Fumizuki:
I would like Yühsia to visit the city in Yenwu's stead.

Rat King:
That's...

Fumizuki:
I will persuade Yenwu. You needn't worry.

Rat King:
Absolutely, you are the boss, after all. But that's not what concerns me...

Rat King:
I'll get to the point. It's far too soon for Yühsia to take on so much responsibility.

Lin Yühsia:
Dad, what did Lady Fumizuki say?

Rat King:
She wants you to go to Dossoles in Wei Yenwu's stead.

Lin Yühsia:
I'll go.

Rat King:
Yühsia.

Lin Yühsia:
......

Lin Yühsia:
I am going.

Fumizuki:
Mr. Lin?

Rat King:
Fine, if my daughter wants to go on a trip, is it her father's place to say no?

Rat King:
She can go.

Fumizuki:
Very well. Yühsia, make sure to pack for a long trip.

Lin Yühsia:
I will.

Rat King:
Yühsia.

Lin Yühsia:
I'll bring you some souvenirs, Dad.

Rat King:
*Sigh*... Nei go sei seoi neoi ah...

Rat King:
Alright, then. It's settled. Get yourself ready for the trip. You will be away for some time. Have your mother help you pack.

Lin Yühsia:
Alright.

Rat King:
If this is what Lady Fumizuki wants, I am sure there is more to it than we know. A holiday... Does this have something to do with Ch'en?

Rat King:
Whatever... No use thinking about it so much. It's not like she'd want to pull any strings to take advantage of Yühsia, what with how fond of the youngsters she is.

Rat King:
That aside... *Sigh*.

Rat King:
Looks like there's no keeping her home when she's all grown up.

Wei Yenwu:
Fumizuki, did you arrange for Lin Yühsia's trip to Dossoles?

Fumizuki:
I did.

Wei Yenwu:
......

Fumizuki:
What's the problem? They invited us not because they had any actual business to discuss with you. It's just a vacation trip.

Wei Yenwu:
You wanted to send Hui-chieh, didn't you?

Fumizuki:
That's right. I was never trying to hide it from you, however.

Wei Yenwu:
If Lin Yühsia is my representative there, Hui-chieh will get to take it easy and have as much fun as she wants, but...

Fumizuki:
Ch'en is at Rhodes Island right now. Although I trust them, I have no way of knowing how she is doing there.

Fumizuki:
Besides, I know our little Ch'en is in no position to represent you right now. Yühsia, on the other hand, always does a good job with everything. She is the perfect substitute.

Wei Yenwu:
The Rat King's daughter won't necessarily become the Rat King herself.

Fumizuki:
If that's what she wants, then give her a chance, and if she manages to seize the opportunity, it just shows how capable she is.

Fumizuki:
Or will the venerable Chief Wei send all of Lungmen's forces after me, a frail lady, for overstepping my boundaries?

Wei Yenwu:
You know I always listen to you when I make these decisions. It's just...

Wei Yenwu:
You've met Candela. Hui-chieh and Yühsia are still far too young to handle her.

Fumizuki:
For how often you call me a worrywart, it certainly seems like you are the biggest in the room.

Fumizuki:
If it wasn't for your personality, perhaps you could've found yourself on better terms with our little Ch'en.

Wei Yenwu:
We are not discussing this right now, Fumizuki.

Fumizuki:
*Sigh*, Dossoles is famous not only in Bolívar, but all across the world, and it is in no small part because of her. She is no ordinary woman.

Fumizuki:
We've been there before. It's a city you could never have imagined in a thousand years.

Fumizuki:
Given she built it singlehandedly, it's no wonder that you fear her, both as the Chief of Lungmen and from a personal standpoint.

Wei Yenwu:
You agree with me, then...

Fumizuki:
But you big shots are always so calculating, trying to get the upper hand over each other, and it's always the first thing that crosses your mind when meeting anyone.

Fumizuki:
If I have to say, I saw it the moment I laid my eyes on Candela. She's the kind of person who's capable of many things. Bad things. But she definitely won't do anything that puts Ch'en and Yühsia in harm's way.

Fumizuki:
You think she will be a bad example for the children, but I think there's no better place to send them.

Wei Yenwu:
......

Fumizuki:
If you are so worried, Yühsia most likely hasn't left for Dossoles yet, and I haven't sent the letter out to Ch'en either. There is still time.

Wei Yenwu:
...

Wei Yenwu:
Fine, we'll do as you say.

Ch'en:
Hm, I spotted a few Rhodes Islanders just now, I think...? Don't tell me they came to Siesta too...

Ch'en:
Guess I'll go find out in a minute.

Ch'en:
Who is it?

Shirayuki:
Miss Ch'en, sorry to interrupt your vacation.

Ch'en:
Shirayuki? What are you doing here?

Shirayuki:
I have a letter for you from the Princess. It's of the utmost importance.

Ch'en:
Did something happen in Lungmen?!

Shirayuki:
Not at all. Please, read the letter.

Ch'en:
Where is it...?

Shirayuki:
Here.

Ch'en:
There's an invitation inside...? I'll start with the letter.

Ch'en:
She's always such a worrywart.

Ch'en:
......

Ch'en:
But... I'm on a holiday right now.

Shirayuki:
It would seem the princess isn't aware of this.

Ch'en:
Right. Still, Dossoles, huh...? Shirayuki, do you know how far away that is?

Shirayuki:
The city is in northwestern Bolívar. If you leave now, it will take roughly fifteen days.

Ch'en:
There's no date on the invitation. Looks like any time will do for them...

Shirayuki:
Will you accept, Miss Ch'en?

Ch'en:
How could I say no to her kindness? All I have to do is take my holiday elsewhere.

Shirayuki:
I, Shirayuki, will pass on your thanks to Lady Fumizuki, Miss Ch'en.

Ch'en:
I've told you this more times than I can count, Shirayuki. We're both operators. Stop it with the 'Miss.'

Shirayuki:
And my answer will remain the same, Miss. You will always be Miss Ch'en to me.

Ch'en:
Eh, whatever.

Ch'en:
Are you coming?

Shirayuki:
No, I'm afraid I have other matters I must attend to. My apologies.

Ch'en:
Alright, looks like it's a solo trip for me again.

Shirayuki:
On another note, it seems that the Doctor and a few other operators have come to this city after completing their mission. If you would like, perhaps you should meet with them before you depart.

Ch'en:
Hm? So I guess my eyes didn't deceive me.

Ch'en:
Well, I'll pass. I'll see them when I'm back at Rhodes Island.

Shirayuki:
Indeed. Now...

Ch'en:
Not so fast, Shirayuki. You have the time to at least stay the evening, don't you? Have dinner with me tonight. We'll head out together tomorrow morning.

Shirayuki:
As you wish, Miss.

Ch'en:
Finally. So this is Dossoles...

Ch'en:
It's just like they say. Stepping into the city is enough to make you forget you're in Bolívar.

Ch'en:
In any case, I should first...

Bodyguard:
Excuse me, but are you Miss Ch'en Hui-chieh?

Ch'en:
That's me, and you would be...?

Bodyguard:
The mayor instructed me to await your arrival here.

Ch'en:
I'm only here for a holiday. Let's not go through all that trouble.

Bodyguard:
No, the mayor specifically instructed us to contact her as soon as you arrive. Please give me just a moment.

Bodyguard:
This is Control Point No. 2. We have successfully intercepted Miss Ch'en Hui-chieh.

Bodyguard:
Yes... Okay, understood.

Bodyguard:
Please come with us. The mayor would like to meet with you.

Ch'en:
*Sigh*, fine.

Bodyguard:
Please go on in, Miss Ch'en.

Ch'en:
...

???:
Miss Ch'en Hui-chieh, looks like you made it here first.

???:
I've long heard that the L.G.D. Special Inspection Unit Chief is a young lady of extraordinary talent. Meeting you in person has only proven that those are no mere rumors.

Ch'en:
You... must be the mayor, Lady Sanchez?

Candela:
Yes, that's right. I am Candela Sancheze, the mayor of Dossoles.

Ch'en:
You speak Yanese pretty well.

Candela:
I've always wanted to cozy up to Mr. Wei, but he hasn't been back since ten years ago. I haven't had much use for my Yanese, even after all the time I spent learning it.

Ch'en:
Lady Sanchez, I'm just here on vacation. I am not representing anyone.

Candela:
Please, call me Candela. You may even call me Auntie, if you want. After all, it's long been my wish to become Chief Wei's sworn sister.

Ch'en:
I will pass, Lady San... Candela.

Candela:
Hahaha...

Candela:
The way you talk, and the way you frown. My, my, you look just like he did when he was still young.

Candela:
But I have to say, he was much more heroic than you are now.

Ch'en:
I'm not much related to Chief Wei...

Candela:
Don't worry. I understand.

Candela:
You have nothing to worry about, my lovely niece. Lady Fumizuki has already told me that you won't be representing anyone, and you will have no burdens on your shoulders.

Candela:
Have some fun. As long as I'm here, there is nothing that can hurt you in this city.

Ch'en:
Thank you for your kindness, then.

Ch'en:
You said I made it here first. Is someone else coming?

Candela:
Right! Wouldn't you say it's a coincidence? She's coming from Lungmen, while you came here from Siesta, and both of you are arriving on the same day.

Ch'en:
Who?

Candela:
Hmm?

Candela:
Oh, looks like Lady Fumizuki's hiding something from you, even though you are bound to find out.

Candela:
Ch'en, my lovely niece, I'm sure you already know, but there are certain formalities that Chief Wei and I must follow given our position, even if we'd rather not.

Candela:
I actually wouldn't have minded if Chief Wei had sent just any old lout off the street... Well, I guess maybe he'd still have to put a little thought into it. Someone like you, perhaps? I would honor them with the same hospitality as I am showing you now.

Candela:
And why does it matter? I invited the Weis and the Rat King here for a holiday.

Candela:
But he knows that will not do, and so do I.

Candela:
He is free to not come, but he must send someone of status. Or it would be tantamount to the Chief of Lungmen disrespecting the Mayor of Dossoles.

Candela:
You would've seen countless headlines in the newspapers of both cities, and way too many things would get unnecessarily problematic.

Ch'en:
So what you are saying is Chief Wei sent someone of sufficient status to represent him.

Candela:
That's right.

Ch'en:
Is it Hoshiguma? No, maybe Swire...?

Candela:
Wrong on both counts.

Ch'en:
Then...

Bodyguard:
Ma'am, she's here.

Candela:
There's your answer.

Lin Yühsia:
Lady Candela Sanchez, esteemed mayor of Dossoles, on behalf of the Chief of Lungmen Wei...

Ch'en:
Lin Yühsia?!

Lin Yühsia:
Ch'en Hui-chieh?!

Ch'en & Lin Yühsia:
What are you doing here?!

Lin Yühsia:
Oh... I get it. No wonder Lady Fumizuki sent me.

Ch'en:
So you're Wei Yenwu's representative.

Candela:
Looks like you two are acquainted. That's wonderful.

Ch'en:
We used to be classmates. That's it.

Lin Yühsia:
She's a friend of a friend. We barely know each other.

Candela:
In that case, wouldn't this be the perfect opportunity for you to reconnect?

Candela:
Anyway, Lin, my dear niece.

Candela:
Just like my niece Ch'en here, you may call me by my given name. No need to be so formal.

Candela:
Even though you're here to represent Chief Wei, you don't need to think too much about such things. No burdens on your shoulders.

Candela:
All you need to do is enjoy this city I'm so proud of.

Lin Yühsia:
Understood...

Candela:
Oh, and two more things.

Lin Yühsia:
Please, by all means.

Candela:
First, I heard that both of you are very bright and can more than hold your own in a fight, that you girls are capable of great things.

Candela:
So I have an extra fun activity prepared just for you two, my beautiful nieces.

Ch'en:
Activity?

Candela:
Before I explain, do you know anything about our city's biggest event of this time?

Ch'en:
The championship that's going on right now?

Candela:
That's right.

Candela:
Dossoles's greatest feature, and indeed what it is known for all across the world, is the 'ocean' that surrounds us, and this ship sailing its waters.

Candela:
It's a piece of renovated Iberian technology. It took much blood, sweat and tears to complete. It's one of my finest masterpieces.

Lin Yühsia:
Including the statue on the ship's bow?

Candela:
Hahaha, that's just my own little addition.

Candela:
As for the water of this 'sea,' it's all sourced from the actual, vast ocean to the north.

Candela:
The water gets dirty and starts to stink after a while, so we replace the ocean water at least twice a year.

Candela:
And this season is when most of us here head to the beach. That's why we have the water replaced around this time.

Candela:
Changing the water is in itself a mundane process. Not only that, but we even have to take away a day of fun from our esteemed guests.

Candela:
Nonetheless, I don't want to have our guests play in any filthy seawater either. It would be an insult to Dossoles's fame.

Candela:
And that's how the Dossoles Warrior Champion came to be.

Candela:
This is a variety competition event that takes place all across the city, and it is entirely sponsored by me, at my expense.

Candela:
I will have someone give you a more detailed explanation later if you would like to know more.

Candela:
What you need to know is that the competition's victor will get to press the button that starts the water changing process. It's an honor that's unique to this city alone.

Lin Yühsia:
So you turned something that used to be trouble into a huge event...

Candela:
Hahaha, that's exactly right.

Candela:
To tell the truth, I'm very happy that the two of you made it before the competition began.

Candela:
I heard you were vacationing in Siesta before you left for our city, Ch'en?

Ch'en:
Yes.

Candela:
What do you think of the music festival there?

Ch'en:
I don't know much about music, but it was pretty lively.

Candela:
Haha, I've met their mayor as well. You could say he, too, is trying his best for his city.

Candela:
Sadly, he doesn't have what it takes to be the master of a city.

Candela:
Besides, a music festival is nothing compared to my championship! Hahaha!

Candela:
It looks like you two can handle yourself in a competition. If you're interested, perhaps you would consider joining the fray.

Candela:
Oh, but if I'm not mistaken, the prelims will be over soon. If you are throwing your hat in the ring, don't wait much longer.

Candela:
If the two of you win together as a team, not only will you brighten Chief Wei's day, you will also get a special present from me.

Lin Yühsia:
I'm not sure about teaming up, but we will give it some thought.

Ch'en:
Now what was that extra activity you mentioned?

Candela:
Oh, look at how forgetful I am. This fun activity has to do with the championship.

Candela:
Sometime last week, my men busted an explosives and universal Originium circuits smuggling scheme.

Candela:
I let a lot of things happen within my borders, but that isn't one of them. You should keep this in mind, too.

Ch'en:
I don't think we'll need any.

Candela:
Hahaha, of course. Just joking.

Candela:
Normally, there would be nothing remotely fun about weapon smuggling, though, as you know, the championship is right around the corner.

Ch'en:
So you don't have enough manpower? Looks like they picked an interesting time to try to smuggle weapons into the city...

Lin Yühsia:
They are probably trying to pull something funny at the competition. I suggest we start with any gray areas.

Candela:
Very good. Looks like I made the right decision to prepare this little activity for you two. It's wonderful that you're already interested.

Candela:
Anyway, if you feel you aren't having as much fun as you'd like at any point during your stay here, you could try your hand at the investigation. For fun.

Ch'en:
Investigating this... for fun?

Candela:
Right, and especially for you, Ch'en. I know you love solving a good case.

Ch'en:
Are you not concerned that your city is under threat?

Candela:
Concerned? Ch'en, my girl, you don't understand.

Candela:
As long as I'm here, no one can threaten this city.

Candela:
You are free to forget all about this mission and enjoy your vacation, or join in the competitions.

Candela:
And even if it leads to any problems down the line, you won't be the ones to blame.

Candela:
It's just like I said. This is a fun little activity that I prepared specifically for the two of you for your vacation.

Ch'en:
......

Lin Yühsia:
Right, we understand.

Candela:
Okay, and here's the other thing.

Candela:
I would love to personally show you around Dossoles and tell you about each of the spectacles I personally erected here...

Candela:
But since Chief Wei didn't come himself, then it also wouldn't be appropriate for me to accompany you two.

Candela:
So, I assigned you a guide.

Candela:
Ernesto, come in.

Ernesto:
Lady Candela.

Candela:
This is one of my sharpest diplomats, Ernesto.

Ernesto:
Pleasure to meet you, señoritas.

Candela:
He speaks Yanese too, but most people here speak Victorian and Leithanian. He can translate for you.

Ch'en:
No need. I speak both.

Lin Yühsia:
Same here...

Candela:
Oh, wonderful.

Candela:
In that case, if you run into anything you need help with, such as the specifics of the championship, then he is the person to ask. Right, Ernesto?

Ernesto:
Yes, of course.

Lin Yühsia:
Alright.

Ch'en:
Thank you.

Candela:
Of course, if you find yourself annoyed by an idiot like him, you are free to come to me with any questions directly, hahaha.

Candela:
Okay, I still have other guests to meet, so please excuse me. I will leave the rest to the youth.

Lin Yühsia:
Thank you very much for your time, Lady Candela.

Ch'en:
......

Lin Yühsia:
......

Ernesto:
Pleased to make your acquaintance, lovely ladies. I am the International Trade Management Department's deputy director, Ernesto Salas.

Ernesto:
Please just call me Ernesto.

Ernesto:
I welcome you two to our city.

Ernesto:
If there is anything you would like to know about the city or there is anywhere you would like to visit, please feel free to ask.

Ernesto:
My mission from Lady Candela is to make sure that you feel at home.

Ch'en:
Please, don't trouble yourself.

Lin Yühsia:
I'm good. Thank you.

Ernesto:
Haha. Well, first things first, your phones have already been readjusted to connect to our intercity net. You are free to make calls or look up cute videos.

Ernesto:
Here's how you can get in touch with me or Lady Candela directly.

Ernesto:
And here are the credit cards that the mayor has prepared for you.

Ernesto:
All your transactions within the city may be paid using this card, and there is no credit limit. All your expenses will be paid by the government.

Ernesto:
You can go on the shopping spree of a lifetime if you'd like.

Ch'en:
We don't need all this.

Ernesto:
This is the way the city treats its guests. Please, just accept them.

Ernesto:
Aside from that... It looks like you have some catching up to do, so I will intrude no longer.

Ernesto:
We will be heading to your hotel next. I will wait for you downstairs. Come look for me as soon as you're ready.

Lin Yühsia:
Okay...

Ch'en:
......

Lin Yühsia:
......

Lin Yühsia:
Long time no see, Ch'en Hui-chieh.

Ch'en:
Long time no see, Lin Yühsia.

Lin Yühsia:
How long has it been since we last met?

Ch'en:
Don't remember. Swire's birthday two years ago?

Lin Yühsia:
I wasn't there.

Ch'en:
I see. Guess I'm mistaken.

Lin Yühsia:
The class reunion the year before, perhaps?

Ch'en:
Oh, right.

Lin Yühsia:
You look like you're doing well. Lady Fumizuki will be glad.

Ch'en:
Maybe.

Ch'en:
How is Swire holding up?

Lin Yühsia:
You haven't heard from Hoshiguma?

Lin Yühsia:
She's more or less the representative there now, and she's pretty good at it. It shouldn't be much longer before she formally takes over your job.

Ch'en:
That's good. She's actually pretty capable of the responsibilities that come with the job, if she works on her temperament a little.

Lin Yühsia:
That's going to be difficult. She wouldn't be Swire if she knew how to mellow out.

Ch'en:
You're right.

Ch'en:
......

Lin Yühsia:
......

Ch'en:
I have a question.

Lin Yühsia:
Go ahead.

Ch'en:
Why did you help him?

Lin Yühsia:
......

Ernesto:
Excuse me, but we will be docking in a moment. I am wondering if you would like to get off the boat or stay on board for a little longer.

Ernesto:
If you two are still talking, I can also arrange a room for you...

Ernesto:
I guess I came at the wrong moment?

Lin Yühsia:
No, you came at just the right moment.

Lin Yühsia:
Take us to the hotel, please.

Ernesto:
Oh, of course.

Ch'en:
......

Ernesto:
Miss Ch'en?

Ch'en:
Let's go.
