D.D.D.:
They've been the target of collusion from the very start of the event, but LUNG wRATh have once again put on a marvelous breakthrough act.

D.D.D.:
Mr. Pancho, you mentioned how this team was struggling to mesh in Round 1. What do you think of them now?

Pancho:
Cooperation troubles don't get resolved in one night.

Pancho:
But obviously, these two know about the problem, so they've clearly divided up their combat.

Pancho:
This time, it's a lot more nimble than the fighting in Round 1.

D.D.D.:
Good to know. So, does that mean their chance of victory has shot up?

Pancho:
Still hard to say. The other contestants'll have their own countermeasures.

D.D.D.:
That's true. Trying to hold back LUNG wRATh normally has already proven ineffective, so let's hope the other competitors can show us some new tricks!

Hoshiguma:
Heh, they're right.

Hoshiguma:
And the mood between them's eased a bit too. Wonder if anything happened.

Swire:
So it comes from the Iberian period, no wonder...

Hoshiguma:
Hm? Missy, that's not the competition. What are you looking at?

Swire:
Information on this cruise ship.

Hoshiguma:
What's so interesting? Did you just say Iberia?

Swire:
Yeah. The ship's actually a relic from the age of Iberia.

Hoshiguma:
That early...? Actually, thinking about it, there's no other country that would have stuff like this.

Swire:
Mhm.

Swire:
And Mayor Candela paid big money to buy it off the Iberians, and for the tech to remodel it.

Swire:
And all this just to have the thing floating out on the city's sea.

Swire:
I don't think there's another person across the whole world who'd do that.

Hoshiguma:
That sure is some level of luxury.

Hoshiguma:
Speaking of which, Missy, weren't you looking into this Mayor the past two days? Any findings?

Swire:
Findings... they're still pretty basic so far.

Swire:
This Candela Sanchez, in some sense, is someone who can stand shoulder to shoulder with Chief Wei.

Hoshiguma:
She's that powerful?

Swire:
Yeah. It's not exactly the same, but they're both completely wrapped up in their cities, and both have a tight grip on the reins of government.

Swire:
As a member of the L.G.D., I would absolutely never say I admire someone who builds a city like this.

Swire:
But as a daughter of the Schwire family, I have to admit, a builder like that is a real tough customer.

Swire:
If we're saying this city's base is much more solid than it seems, then its superstructure is even crazier than it seems.

Swire:
Agents of three governments come flooding into this city every day, and the news will sometimes report on disputes, even small-scale conflicts, between them.

Swire:
But the thing is, nobody cares.

Swire:
They come here as an open secret, respect an unwritten code of conduct, and revel in a joy they could never have outside.

Swire:
Can you picture it?

Swire:
The first time the three sides clashed, Mayor Candela showed up for sure, and used some method we could never imagine to 'talk them over.'

Swire:
And after that, anyone who came to this city had to keep by the rules she set.

Swire:
But I just don't know what it was. Leverage? Or a political bargaining chip?

Hoshiguma:
Lady Candela has enough armed force on hand to defend this city, that's for sure.

Hoshiguma:
But beyond all of that, I feel like there's a real simple answer, Missy. Haven't you already realized?

Swire:
Realized what?

Hoshiguma:
Here's what it is—alcohol, sugar, coffee, and entertainment.

Swire:
How could those things possibly...

Hoshiguma:
It's a time-old tale, Missy. The frugal convert to extravagance, but it's a nightmare to go the other way.

Hoshiguma:
Forget old boys who've been spoiled rotten since childhood. You could even take me. If I suddenly lost something I was real used to and felt was real nice, I'd be struggling for sure.

Hoshiguma:
Not to mention after losing it, I'd have to make do with junk instead.

Hoshiguma:
Sometimes, people's wills just bend like paper, and what Bolívar's like now really doesn't help. If you told me this place was full of people with firm wills, I wouldn't believe you.

Swire:
......

Hoshiguma:
It can't have been that smooth as first, but as time went on, nobody could stand up to reject it all. All of this has become some sort of status quo.

Hoshiguma:
But I'll also acknowledge, for being able to decide straight from the start that this was how this city would come to manifest, this Mayor really is phenomenally powerful.

Hoshiguma:
Powerful to the point that it's frightening.

Lin Yühsia:
There's a curve ahead. Do we take a shortcut?

Ch'en:
No need. According to the map, we get the most shortcuts on the cycling section. If someone's going to try something, it'll probably be around then.

Ernesto:
Don't forget, Ms. Candela has her underlings guarding the shortcuts. They're probably more dangerous than any dangerous terrorists.

Ernesto:
If the other side didn't make a move during Round 1, I can only assume they'll be even more cautious during Round 2.

Ch'en:
Mm. We'll see as things come.

Hoshiguma:
Come to mention it, Missy, does this MC seem familiar to you?

Swire:
Hm? Now that you say it, it's like I really have seen them somewhere before.

Hoshiguma:
Mmm. I feel like I've seen her somewhere, too.

Sideroca:
She's D.D.D., you know.

Hoshiguma:
D.D.D.? Oh, now I remember. She's that real famous DJ, right? I saw a poster once.

Hoshiguma:
What's she doing here as a presenter, huh.

Hoshiguma:
Mm? Wait... Sideroca? What are you doing here? Out on a mission?

Sideroca:
You could say that. It was a mission in Bolívar, helping Eyjafjalla with some geological research on the side. We heard there was a city here, and once we were all done, we put in for a vacation here.

Sideroca:
How about you? Came with Ch'en?

Hoshiguma:
No, we came for a different reason.

Hoshiguma:
You seem pretty in the know. You a music girl too?

Sideroca:
Not really. A lot of operators are into her, and I've learned some things by osmosis. Right, you want to come over and sit with us?

Hoshiguma:
What do you say, Missy?

Swire:
Alright. I was getting a little bored of the competition anyway.

Swire:
Eyjafjalla's here too?

Sideroca:
Yep. She's out here so we can get her to relax for once.

Swire:
Wow, then that's perfect—I've never met her before. I intend to give her a proper hello.
