Hoshiguma:
Hey, look. That's Ch'en and Lin they're chasing, right?

Candela:
Impressive. Really impressive.

Hoshiguma:
We should go help—

Suddenly, a loud explosion echoes from the ship, not far from the shore.

Ch'en:
What did you do?

Lin Yühsia:
A little surprise.

Lin Yühsia:
Remember how I asked you what to do after the hostages are rescued?

Lin Yühsia:
I did agree with you that I should take everyone with me and leave, but then it came to me I still had that bomb.

Lin Yühsia:
So I thought I'd give them a little surprise.

Ch'en:
......

Lin Yühsia:
Care for a drink?

Ch'en:
Interesting time for such a display of aesthetics.

Lin Yühsia:
I didn't notice this until I got the boat out here. Figured I'd try my hand at arranging it.

Ch'en:
Sounds lame.

Lin Yühsia:
Talking about yourself?

Ch'en:
......

Lin Yühsia:
......

Ch'en:
I can't tell for sure whether you did that intentionally or not.

Lin Yühsia:
What?

Ch'en:
Have you forgotten already? 'When it comes time for you to take over, you can't always do as they did in the past.'

Ch'en:
The call was still connected when you said that.

Lin Yühsia:
......

Ch'en:
So, be straight with me. You didn't do what I think you did, right?

Lin Yühsia:
We're almost to the shore.

Lin Yühsia:
You lost, old man.

Pancho:
......

Pancho:
You have no idea what you've done, helping Candela.

Candela:
You've done well, Pancho.

Captain's Subordinate:
Candela!

Pancho:
Stop. We lost.

Candela:
Good choice.

Candela:
Come, sit.

Pancho:
What are you trying to do, Candela?

Candela:
Can't you tell? I'm inviting you to eat with me.

Pancho snorts, but sits down opposite to Candela nonetheless.

Candela:
Most men would be terrified at this point. That's what I like about you, Pancho.

Pancho:
You flatter me.

Pancho:
I lost, but not only have you not arrested me, you're asking me out to eat. What are you trying to do? Humiliate me?

Candela:
I want a chat, Pancho.

Candela:
You used Ernesto to distract me, and you had your underlings plant bombs all over the city during the competition.

Candela:
Finally, right before the third round was to begin, you took all the elites and dignitaries on the ship hostage to keep me from doing anything.

Candela:
I've got to hand it to you, Pancho. This is the closest I've come to losing my city.

Pancho:
Concha tu madre, Candela. My men and I spent days on end to put this plan in motion.

Pancho:
Then, it so happens you invited two outsiders who don't know the slightest thing about this city here, and it so happens they took on this case for you.

Pancho:
And they... They happen to thwart my plans!!

Pancho:
Why did you, of all people, win?!

Candela:
I won?

Candela:
What are you talking about? Dear Pancho, I think you've spent so much time in my city that you've forgotten who I am.

Candela:
Or perhaps you never understood me at all.

Candela:
I was never your opponent, and you didn't lose to me.

Candela:
You merely failed. It's that simple.

Candela:
You lived in the city you despise the most for decades, complaining about the three governments, yet you accepted the backing of one of them just to overthrow me.

Candela:
Let me guess. It's probably someone from the Leithanian side. Oh, I even have a good idea who it might be.

Candela:
Tell me, Pancho. What was going on in your mind that you turned to those ruthless men for help?

Pancho:
......

Candela:
Oh, so you've learned to swallow your pride.

Candela:
In that case, why not wag your tail at me and beg for my mercy?

Candela:
How are you so sure I wouldn't help you?

Candela:
I mean it, Pancho. If you had come begging, perhaps I would've given you the manpower and money to fight the wars you so love.

Candela:
And if you then managed to win, this city would have to bow down to you.

Candela:
You couldn't find a more attractive plan if you tried.

Pancho:
I will never bow down to you.

Candela:
Oh, look at you. You're always so stubborn.

Candela:
Men like you always have unrealistic expectations of the words 'complete' and 'independence'.

Candela:
You dream of an ideology that will bring all of you together. You seek a symbol that will unite all of you under its banner.

Candela:
But the truth is Bolívar has never been independent. It has no history, so where will you find your ideology and symbol?

Candela:
Suppose you succeeded, would the Bolívar you go on to forge really be the Bolívar you've always dreamt of? Somehow I doubt it.

Pancho:
It doesn't matter what you say. All I've ever wanted is an end to the war, for peace to be restored to Bolívar.

Pancho:
I lost. I accept defeat, Candela.

Pancho:
My undertaking may not be righteous, but, at the very least, I am more righteous than you are!

Candela:
Oh, pardon. Look at me, I confused you with the men behind you.

Candela:
You are not the kind of man I described. You wish to save this country from the bottom of your heart, and that earned you this seat right now.

Candela:
However, you must be punished for your failure, so I will treat you as their leader nonetheless. Makes things easier that way.

Candela:
I've never thought myself righteous, dear old Pancho.

Candela:
I don't care what the three governments are doing, and I certainly don't care about your Bolívar.

Candela:
You say I'm obsessed with this city, but you're wrong. I don't care about this city.

Candela:
What I care about is the meaning that this city represents.

Pancho:
Meaning? You call wasting your life away on entertainment meaning?

Candela:
*Sigh*, look at how stubborn you are. You will never understand what money represents.

Candela:
Okay, take this old bastard away. I will talk to him some other time.

Candela:
If you come across anyone trying to resist, you know what to do.

Bodyguard:
Yes, ma'am.

Lin Yühsia:
......

Ch'en:
...

Hoshiguma:
Wow, I bet not even the Hung-mên Banquet was this intense.

Hoshiguma:
Just watching them was enough to give me creeps.

Swire:
That was about as suffocating to watch as watching my father and grandpa having dinner together.

Ch'en:
Agreed.

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma?!

Lin Yühsia:
Swire?!

Hoshiguma:
Hey there.

Swire:
Look at you two. You're drenched. Get a towel and dry yourselves.

Ch'en:
What are you doing here?!

Hoshiguma:
Hahaha, it's a long story. We'll talk about it over dinner.

Swire:
Eh, I'm not sure I'm in the mood for dinner after all this.

Candela:
Oh, my girls, look at me chattering away with Pancho, leaving my heroes of the day out in the cold.

Candela:
Hey, you over there, get two drones over here right now. Lighting, too.

Candela:
That was beautiful from the two of you. Simply beautiful.

Candela:
I have to thank Wei Yenwu for introducing me to such fine examples of the younger generation.

Candela:
And you contributed a wonderful, unparalleled ending to this championship.

Ch'en:
Championship? Ending?

Candela:
That's right. If nothing goes wrong, I am guessing a lot of people are sitting in front of their TVs, watching us.

Candela:
Although we didn't get footage of everything that transpired inside the ship, I am sure the sight of you taking on Pancho on the deck has left a deep impression.

Candela:
Everyone must be cheering for you two right about now.

Ch'en:
You once told me that as long as you're here, no one can threaten this city.

Candela:
Yes, I did. What of it?

Ch'en:
You don't consider everything that just happened a threat?

Candela:
Hahaha, my little Ch'en, you are still far too young.

Candela:
What constitutes a threat? Is it the city getting leveled? Is it seeing its entire population massacred?

Candela:
No, those are hardly threats, Ch'en.

Candela:
The real threat is the city's people losing their desires, never to seek enjoyment again.

Candela:
But you've been a policewoman for a great number of years. Do you think that's possible?

Ch'en:
......

Candela:
Oh, the look on your face tells me what you think.

Candela:
You see. You know it yourself. The answer is that it's not possible.

Candela:
And as long as that remains the answer, this city will continue to exist. And if Dossoles falls, Tressoles will rise in its place.

Candela:
However many cities you need, I can build.

Ch'en:
......

Candela:
Nonetheless, that doesn't erase the fact that you two are heroes to this city.

Candela:
Oh, look at me. How forgetful I am.

Candela:
Is the party ready yet?

Bodyguard:
For the most part.

Candela:
Now where's my mic... Oh, there we are.

Candela:
Ahem, my dear citizens and tourists. Whether you are sitting in front of a TV or watching from the beach...

Candela:
It gives me great pleasure to announce to you the final victors of this year's Dossoles Warrior Champion, as well as the heroes that saved our city.

Candela:
Our heroines from Lungmen—Ch'en Hui-chieh and Lin Yühsia!

Candela:
Let us also thank Pancho for taking it upon himself to give us such a grand performance!

Candela:
Now, we'll be throwing a party on the beach. Everyone is welcome!
