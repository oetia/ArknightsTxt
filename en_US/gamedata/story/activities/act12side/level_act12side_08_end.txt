Candela:
*Cough*... Testing, 1, 2, 3. Can you hear me?

Candela:
My dear citizens and friends, as well as our beloved tourists from afar, Candela speaking.

Candela:
First, please don't be alarmed.

Candela:
I will admit that I did not see Old Pancho's plan coming.

Candela:
I never expected that my trusted subordinate would do something as horrifying as to plot against me to take this city. How terrifying!

Candela:
However, as I said in the beginning, this is no cause for alarm.

Candela:
Rather, I must give Pancho my thanks.

Candela:
To be honest, I've been wondering for the past two years what we could do to make the championship more exciting, more eye-opening, and more thrilling to all of us.

Candela:
And I've never found a particularly nice way to do this.

Candela:
Yet Pancho's found it. Through his actions, he's putting on an even more exciting championship!

Candela:
Think the championship's over?

Candela:
No, not at all. At that very moment, our championship has reached its true climax!

Candela:
At this point in time, all teams are revived, and betting has reopened.

Candela:
Stop the troublemakers that are sowing chaos in the city to the best of your ability. I know you can.

Candela:
And once everything comes to a successful conclusion, you will be adequately rewarded.

Swire:
......

Hoshiguma:
......

Candela:
Oh, you must be the ones. My subordinates told me you helped them foil a plan to assassinate me.

Candela:
Come, sit with me. As your reward, you may sit here in the front row to enjoy this match with me.

Swire:
Are you... serious?

Candela:
Of course. I'm always serious.

Candela:
Pancho knows he wouldn't stand much of a chance if he flipped the table right in front of me.

Candela:
And that's why he's holing up in the ship I entrusted to him.

Candela:
And if my guess is correct, he probably added quite a few features to it in secret. Maybe a cannon or two?

Hoshiguma:
But if that was all there was to it, it would hardly be a threat.

Candela:
That's right.

Candela:
Between the second and third rounds, we invite dignitaries from all factions to board the ship so they may enjoy the competition in person.

Swire:
Oh, I see. The dignitaries. That's the key here.

Swire:
The city's operations depend on dealing with them.

Candela:
Right, right, right. It isn't a matter of whether I want to solve this problem of his or not, but whether the bigwigs' underlings want me to solve his problem right away.

Candela:
Tsk, making such a huge ruckus, only by playing dirty.

Candela:
It was probably Ernesto who taught him that.

Candela:
Well, as you can see, there isn't much I can do, and there isn't much that he can do either.

Candela:
In that case, we might as well make things more interesting.

Swire:
Wouldn't that be provoking him...?

Candela:
If he actually dragged the brass hats out to slaughter one by one, he wouldn't be doing much with the city even if I handed him the keys.

Hoshiguma:
You don't get it, Missy. He wants to take over the city and take it to war, so he needs the big shots' backing.

Hoshiguma:
Otherwise, he wouldn't have the money or manpower to actually go to war.

Hoshiguma:
And if I had to guess, some of the big shots on the ship might already have come to an agreement with him.

Swire:
......

Candela:
Oh? Now I'm taking an interest in you young ladies. From the way you are dressed, I suppose you're not from Bolívar?

Hoshiguma:
Haha, we are from Lungmen, and two of our friends happen to be on the ship.

Candela:
Hm? So you are friends of Ch'en and Lin? They didn't mention you at all.

Hoshiguma:
We didn't tell them we'd be here on a vacation, so that makes sense.

Candela:
Hahaha, I see.

Candela:
In that case, let me tell you one more thing—

Candela:
I gave Ch'en and Lin this mission, but I also promised Lady Fumizuki that they would not come to harm during their stay here.

Candela:
Do you know what that means?

Hoshiguma:
It means it's not yet time.

Candela:
You know your stuff, young lady of Higashi.

Candela:
And if something does happen to them, then I'm afraid the old men on the ship will find themselves lost at sea, thanks to Pancho.

Swire:
......

Hoshiguma:
Missy, don't be scared.

Candela:
Come, come. They say that it takes a fight to get to know each other. It just happens there's one unfolding before us. Come, sit down. Let's talk.

Lin Yühsia:
You done?

Ch'en:
Done.

Ch'en:
Things don't look good here, though.

Lin Yühsia:
Looks like having you deal with Ernesto while I investigate didn't save us enough time.

Ch'en:
Right...

Lin Yühsia:
Not happy about it?

Ch'en:
Not one bit... but not much I can do.

Lin Yühsia:
This whole affair isn't all that simple. We knew that ahead of time, no?

Ch'en:
I didn't expect things to get so out of hand, though.

Lin Yühsia:
You scared?

Ch'en:
Of course not.

Ch'en:
Where are you now?

Lin Yühsia:
In one of the cabins.

Lin Yühsia:
I took a stroll around while you had your chat with Ernesto. The atmosphere wasn't all that tense before Pancho put his plans in motion, though.

Lin Yühsia:
But right after his speech, the crew and the sailors started to make their move.

Lin Yühsia:
The whole ship is on high alert now, and they are very well-supplied and well-equipped.

Ch'en:
Sounds like you're ready for a seesaw battle?

Lin Yühsia:
We aren't completely out of options just yet.

Ch'en:
How do you figure?

Lin Yühsia:
They locked all the dignitaries in a single room.

Ch'en:
Common practice among thugs... Hold on.

Ch'en:
Let's start with the hostages.

Lin Yühsia:
Looks like you figured it out.

Ch'en:
It doesn't matter how many weapons they have on the ship, how well supplied they are, and how many men they have to support them on land, Lady Candela has control here. The best outcome he can hope for is a draw.

Ch'en:
The odds will be against him if it drags out.

Ch'en:
These hostages are basically his lifeline.

Lin Yühsia:
Heh, that's right. These dignitaries are high officials in the three governments.

Lin Yühsia:
As hostages, they really help keep things in check.

Lin Yühsia:
It doesn't take very long. All he needs is a brief moment, he just needs Lady Candela to hesitate for a second.

Lin Yühsia:
Then he'll get to do so much more. He'll have so many more bargaining chips.

Lin Yühsia:
But there's only the two of us here.

Lin Yühsia:
To be honest, I really am not into the idea of playing hero of justice with you.

Ch'en:
I'll do it.

Ch'en:
I'll get their attention and leave the hostages to you.

Lin Yühsia:
That could work. There should be a lifeboat on the ship, or we could make them jump into the sea and swim.

Lin Yühsia:
What happens after that?

Ch'en:
What do you mean?

Lin Yühsia:
You'll run after everyone's rescued?

Ch'en:
If you want to stay on the ship and play the hero, feel free.

Lin Yühsia:
I guess that's how it'll go, then.

Lin Yühsia:
So, should we begin?

Ch'en:
Let's do it. Right, don't hang up. Stay in touch with me.

Ernesto:
Ugh...? Where am I...?

Rafaela:
Hermano, are you okay?

Rafaela:
That Ch'en woman knocked you out.

Ernesto:
Oh, right... Now I remember...

Ernesto:
What's the situation?

Rafaela:
Things are proceeding according to plan. A few of the bigwigs have already agreed to help Papa.

Ernesto:
Wait, where's Ch'en?

Rafaela:
It seems she's been causing a ruckus all over the ship after knocking you out. Papa ordered everyone to find and capture her.

Ernesto:
Causing a ruckus... No.

Ernesto:
Rafaela, check the hostage holding area right away.

Ernesto:
Ch'en might be creating an opening for Lin.

Ernesto:
We're in trouble if they manage to save the hostages.

Rafaela:
But what about you...?

Ernesto:
I'm fine. Now go.

Rafaela:
Okay.

Ernesto:
......

Ch'en:
An old friend once told me, I have to take a beating before I can learn, like a young her, that being a stubborn ass is just a stupid impulse.

Ch'en:
And even now, I've got no idea what kind of stubbornness I'm supposed to stick to and what counts as an unrealistic, stupid impulse.

Ch'en:
But my guess is she probably knows that's not enough to stop me, or my name isn't Ch'en Hui-chieh.

Ernesto:
Good for you, Miss Ch'en. You know what you are doing and what you must do.

Ernesto:
But me?

Ernesto struggles to his feet and stumbles out of the room.
