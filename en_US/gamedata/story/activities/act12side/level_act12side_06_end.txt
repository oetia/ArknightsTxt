D.D.D.:
That's our Team LUNG wRATh! If it's a fight you want, they ain't gonna disappoint!

D.D.D.:
They took down all the guys that surrounded them with ease!

D.D.D.:
But the teams up front have already swum more than halfway through!

D.D.D.:
Will LUNG wRATh make it?!

Ch'en:
What are you looking at? Get swimming.

Lin Yühsia:
I'm trying to figure something out.

Ch'en:
What?

Lin Yühsia:
Now that both of us suspect Ernesto, and he's behind us, perhaps we should have prioritized taking him out.

Ch'en:
You have a point.

Ch'en:
But we aren't sure he's actually behind any of this yet.

Ch'en:
Besides, no matter who's behind it, it's clear they don't want us to win the competition.

Ch'en:
But as a goal, that's not specific enough.

Lin Yühsia:
Right. In other words, they don't want us to get on the ship.

Ch'en:
Enough chit-chat. We're losing.

Lin Yühsia:
Us? No way.

Lin Yühsia:
You go on ahead. I haven't done something like this in a while. I need to prepare first.

Ch'en:
Okay...

D.D.D.:
The two of them had a short discussion, and then, for one reason or another, Ch'en leaped into the water by herself.

D.D.D.:
Meanwhile, Lin stayed behind on the beach. Looks like she's warming up and picking up sand.

D.D.D.:
We already know that Lin can turn sand into glass to use as a weapon. Is she trying to build a glass bridge to cross the ocean?

Lin Yühsia:
Dad would definitely be able to build a bridge with the sand here.

Lin Yühsia:
I can't do that.

Lin Yühsia:
But that doesn't mean I don't have my own way of doing things.

Lin Yühsia:
This should be enough.

Lin Yühsia:
Now where is Ch'en Hui-chieh... Perfect.

Lin Yühsia:
Hmph... Go!

D.D.D.:
What's this...?!

D.D.D.:
Lin is actually 'running' on the ocean's surface!

Candela:
No, she isn't running. She's leaping.

Candela:
With the sand she collected, she's synthesizing glass pillars at wherever she lands to give herself her next leap.

Candela:
And to save on sand, she's even jumping on top of whoever happens to be nearby, using them as springboards.

Candela:
Hahaha, this is good. This is very good!

D.D.D.:
Well, that's a hell of a way to cross the water. Never seen anything like it before!

D.D.D.:
And this probably means that the two of them talked it over beforehand. There ain't enough springboards out in the ocean, so Ch'en would go first to pave the way for Lin.

D.D.D.:
The two of them once again showing just how touching their comradeship can be!

Hoshiguma:
Hahaha, that's quite an unexpected technique that Miss Lin is using, but I kind of doubt they agreed on it beforehand.

Swire:
True. The way Ch'en looked when the camera flew past her was so funny.

Hoshiguma:
Huh, I really didn't expect the two of them working together to be so much fun.

D.D.D.:
Honey Summer is still in the lead, and contestant Jarvan is making his way toward the goal with an unstoppable momentum.

D.D.D.:
The other teams are right behind them.

D.D.D.:
But none of them ever expected Lin right on their tails!

D.D.D.:
She blew straight past third place!

D.D.D.:
And she's using our second place contestant's head as her springboard!

D.D.D.:
Jarvan has noticed her, but there's nothing he can do about it!

D.D.D.:
The heartless damsel flew right past Jarvan! And right over his head, even!

D.D.D.:
First place! Miss Lin is the first to make it to the goal! Team LUNG wRATh remains at the top of the list!

D.D.D.:
My, how the turntables have turned!

Ernesto:
Oh, come on, you're kidding me. How did they manage to win when the odds were stacked against them? That's basically cheating.

Ernesto:
Haha, hahaha...

Ernesto:
What do I do now?
