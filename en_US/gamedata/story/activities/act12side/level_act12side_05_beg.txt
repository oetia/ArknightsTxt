D.D.D.:
As we follow the event's progress, the leading team has already passed the cycling checkpoint, and it's now that we're seeing a change in the contest!

D.D.D.:
After the might-and-power LUNG wRATh of Round 1 passed the cycling checkpoint and got to riding, another team's immediately begun to personally deal with them.

D.D.D.:
And moreover, they seem to have changed strategies this time.

D.D.D.:
Lady Candela, can we invite you to explain to everyone, please!

Candela:
Isn't it clear? This bunch know that even attacking all at once doesn't ensure they're an opponent to the team, so they've elected to stall them out, and not to overpower them.

Candela:
Tactics like that put you up very close to those two in the footrace, but plenty of moves get tricky to pull when you're on a vehicle.

Candela:
So here in the cycling segment is where they're opting to do it.

Candela:
It goes without saying, the results aren't bad.

D.D.D.:
Without a doubt. They've gotten just close enough to LUNG wRATh, without moving up to attack. It's been trick after trick to harass them, giving them no way to comfortably pick up the pace.

D.D.D.:
We can see just how far behind the leading team LUNG wRATh is!

D.D.D.:
They're stuck with a handicap on their bikes, and getting off means falling behind! LUNG wRATh face their biggest crisis in the competition yet!

Lin Yühsia:
They're not trying to defeat us, just stall us.

Ernesto:
What's the plan? We're hard-pressed to try combat cycling. We'll be completely held up at this rate.

Lin Yühsia:
(Hushed) It seems someone wants us to take a shortcut.

Ch'en:
(Hushed) I'm on the same page.

Ch'en:
(Hushed) Go for it?

Lin Yühsia:
(Hushed) Heh.

D.D.D.:
LUNG wRATh have chosen to charge straight through an alley to shake the other teams off them!

D.D.D.:
But just as we saw on another stage, our city's crack troops wait in the alleys!

D.D.D.:
Though I'd love to cover the other teams too, LUNG wRATh has completely captured our attention!

D.D.D.:
Have they brought on their own doom, or will they survive the odds? We're going to find out!

Ernesto:
This way! This is a pretty quiet alley, so I reckon nobody...

Lin Yühsia:
Careful.

The moment Ernesto turns back to look, a crossbow bolt flies out at him from a corner, but is cut down by a chop from Lin Yühsia.

Ambush A:
......

Ambush B:
......

Ernesto:
Leave this to me, and hurry!

As Ernesto talks, he throws a key to Ch'en.

Ernesto:
(Hushed) Hold onto this key.

Ernesto:
(Hushed) There's an arms store of mine over there. It should be there the moment you head out.

Ernesto:
(Hushed) There's a back door in the basement leading to an underground passage. It'll be way faster along that way.

Ernesto:
(Hushed) I'll hold them off here. Go on ahead.

Ch'en:
...Will you be fine by yourself?

Ernesto:
As long as one of us makes it to the end, that's our win! Go!

Lin Yühsia:
Alright.

Ch'en:
We break out of here.
