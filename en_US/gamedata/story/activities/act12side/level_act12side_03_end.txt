D.D.D.:
This is phenomenal work! Ch'en snuck into an alley to save the trapped Mizuki, and followed it by directly confronting all the other competitors there.

D.D.D.:
It seems the other teams have determined LUNG wRATh is too dangerous to keep around, and have all silently accorded to work together.

D.D.D.:
But even so, Ch'en isn't cowed one bit, choosing to take up the fight.

D.D.D.:
A battle to absolutely revel in!

D.D.D.:
But we can't forget about the other side of the alley, where Lin battles too!

D.D.D.:
Unlike Ch'en's teeth-gritting clash in the alleyway, Lin's spared only a few moves to hold down the entrance, and deter any team who dares come.

D.D.D.:
Is there anyone in this whole championship who can overcome this combination's mere presence?!

Hoshiguma:
Ha ha, goes to show they do work when they each fight their own.

Hoshiguma:
Hey, Missy, if Ch'en and Miss Lin fought, who do you think'd win?

Swire:
Why?

Hoshiguma:
I'm interested, y'know. Put two really powerful guys together, and who wouldn't wanna know who the stronger is.

Swire:
Only you'd think like that!

Swire:
I wouldn't know anyway. It's the first time I've seen this woman fight in years.

Hoshiguma:
Huh? Weren't you and Miss Lin buddy-buddy? Weird you never got to see this.

Swire:
Who's buddies with who? She plays at that mystery, 24/7. There's times she doesn't even answer the phone.

Swire:
And who says you've seen someone fight just 'cause you know them?

Hoshiguma:
That's fair enough, I guess that's just me being used to Ch'en. If she wanted to win now, I'd be out of luck banking on just her swordplay.

Swire:
Not everyone's got the same dynamic as you two.

Swire:
Besides, it's a good thing I haven't seen it. I worry the day I do, I'll be trying to arrest her.

Hoshiguma:
Makes sense. She's the Rat King's daughter, after all.

Hoshiguma:
Eh, still can't say so, though. He's not a bad egg or anything.

Hoshiguma:
When I was a fresh dumbass in Lungmen...

Swire:
Save it. I've met the Rat King before, you know. I don't need you telling me.

Hoshiguma:
Hey, as long as you get it.

Swire:
Forget that, you just used the word 'dumbass,' didn't you?

Hoshiguma:
Look at me, using vulgar language in front of Milady. Oughta slap me.

Swire:
Hmph.

Swire:
So you and Ch'en have seen how she takes fights?

Hoshiguma:
C'mon, I'm here because I haven't. Neither has Ch'en, I reckon.

Hoshiguma:
You're right about one thing, though. It's a good thing we've never seen her fight before. That'd put us in the tough position, we'd have to take her in.

Swire:
As long as you get it.

Hoshiguma:
Never thought there'd be a day when she and Ch'en work together, though.

Hoshiguma:
You really do see everything as you get older.

Hoshiguma:
So in the end, who do you think would win, then?

Swire:
Don't feel like guessing.

Hoshiguma:
Heh, then I'll guess on my own.

Hoshiguma:
In my opinion, if Ch'en had her sword, it'd be hard for Lin Yühsia to ever get near her.

Hoshiguma:
But, if she does let Miss Lin get near, then Ch'en's lost.

Swire:
Ch'en sure sucks.

Hoshiguma:
You can't say that either. Ch'en's solid with her kickboxing. Joint locks and grapples and whatever. She's amazing with all our normal training, too.

Hoshiguma:
You saw how decent her accuracy was too, just now.

Hoshiguma:
But in the end, Ch'en's best with a sword.

Swire:
So you're implying Lin Yühsia's as good in close-quarters as Ch'en is with her sword.

Hoshiguma:
More or less.

Lin Yühsia:
Having fun acting the hero, Hui-chieh?

Ch'en:
Not really, but I don't need you worrying.

Ernesto:
Sorry, Miss Ch'en, I...

Ch'en:
I told you, you could've just waited over there for me. You did fine.

Mizuki:
Thank you for helping me out.

Ch'en:
You're welcome.

Mizuki:
But, um, why did you do it?

Ch'en:
No reason. I saw you, so I helped.

Mizuki:
I see. You're a nice person, Miss.

Mizuki:
And since you're nice, here.

Ernesto:
Is this... pure gold?

Mizuki:
Mhm, they were only after me because I had this.

Ernesto:
And you're fine giving it to us?

Mizuki:
It's alright, I can go look for some more.

Mizuki:
Besides, I never really cared about the competition anyway. Getting to know someone as nice as Miss Ch'en is enough for me already.

Lin Yühsia:
I'll give you a heads-up. Quite a few teams are on high alert—you can chat all you want, but you'd better not stay here too long.

Mizuki:
I'm heading off, then. Bye-bye~

Ch'en:
We'd better move too.

Lin Yühsia:
Can I just ask, did you get anything out of that other than playing hero?

Ch'en:
Does gold not count?

Lin Yühsia:
I guess.

Ch'en:
What about you?

Lin Yühsia:
Nothing in particular.

Lin Yühsia:
So, continue? Or hand in?

Ch'en:
We'll continue.

Lin Yühsia:
Alright.

D.D.D.:
Alright, dear audience. I've just gotten word that all twenty pure gold ingots have been handed in.

D.D.D.:
Which means, Round 1 has reached a consummate close.

D.D.D.:
Now, then, we'll move to the voting phase.

D.D.D.:
Voting will last several hours, and once it closes, we'll be here on stage announcing the teams that made it out of Round 1! Don't miss it!

Ch'en:
...It's over.

Ernesto:
There's still Round 1 voting, but with your popularity, I'm sure we'll be fine.

Lin Yühsia:
Yes.

Ernesto:
That said, it seems you haven't gotten leads on any dangerous terrorists, Miss Lin?

Lin Yühsia:
Not on my end.

Ernesto:
Then maybe there really isn't anything to worry about.

Lin Yühsia:
Possibly.

Lin Yühsia:
Hui-chieh, do you have a moment?

Ch'en:
For what?

Lin Yühsia:
I need you for something.
