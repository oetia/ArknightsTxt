D.D.D.:
What now? LUNG wRATh have hit a government-issued ambush blockade.

D.D.D.:
In all the frenzy, Ernesto's decided to take up the rear, and the two heroines have caught his key and left to press forward.

D.D.D.:
Ernesto's combat strength might be as impressive, but with this many enemies, his defeat could only be a matter of time anyway!

D.D.D.:
But as for the heroines, they've broken out of the entrapment, but ambushes still lie ahead! Can they really get away without a hitch?

D.D.D.:
Oh? They've opened a door on the street and rushed inside!

D.D.D.:
This store...

Candela:
Is one of Ernesto's.

D.D.D.:
So that's their game! Looks like the key Ernesto left them works for sheltering in a shop of his.

D.D.D.:
But is this truly going to work out?

D.D.D.:
Hold on! Director, switch cameras!

D.D.D.:
Alright, that's the REAL game! From another angle it all makes sense. This store has a back door.

D.D.D.:
And we can see, there's a passage from that door through to the main street, and it hasn't been discovered by any other team's interference!

D.D.D.:
Is this LUNG wRATh's chance, or is it—

The words are still on D.D.D.'s lips when, there on the screen, the sound of a tremendous explosion comes from Ernesto's arms store.

D.D.D.:
Wh—Wh-Wh-What in the world is going on here?

D.D.D.:
Lady Candela, is that an obstacle you installed as well?

Candela:
If it was, it wouldn't be as basic as blowing up this one single shop.

D.D.D.:
This... could it be that another team knew Ernesto had this up his sleeve, and laid a trap?!

D.D.D.:
If so, then we can say LUNG wRATh has been completely and utterly outdone!

D.D.D.:
LUNG wRATh, is this what buries you?!

Eyjafjalla:
Wow... Miss Ch'en and Miss Lin will be okay, won't they?

Hoshiguma:
Relax, they've both been around the block. A little explosion like that's not gonna get them.

Hoshiguma:
That said... this competition's no stranger to dirty play, but this one's a little too targeted.

Hoshiguma:
Wonder if Ch'en's got beef with someone here.

Ambush A:
Grrr... what the hell's with this guy? I can't even hit him.

Mizuki:
Uh... I think that's the way Miss Ch'en's bunch went.

Mizuki:
Let's go take a look and see.

Lin Yühsia:
Hui-chieh, are you dead?

Ch'en:
*cough*, *cough*. Like that would kill me.

Lin Yühsia:
You're alive. Good. Your bike?

Ch'en:
Gone.

Ch'en:
Yours?

Lin Yühsia:
Perfectly fine.

Lin Yühsia:
It seems our opposition didn't want us dead and buried either.

Lin Yühsia:
But...

Lin Yühsia:
As luck would have it, the exit is blocked.

Ch'en:
Well, good for luck.

Lin Yühsia:
Your view?

Ch'en:
We find a way out. What else?

Lin Yühsia:
What I'm asking is who did it.

Ch'en:
Looks like our intuition was on the mark.

Lin Yühsia:
Right. Ernesto couldn't hold it in, I'm guessing.

Lin Yühsia:
But don't you think it's odd? If I were him, this isn't how I'd do it.

Lin Yühsia:
Only one at the end of his rope would use such self-destructive means.

Ch'en:
Maybe, it wasn't actually him.

Lin Yühsia:
Impossible.

Ch'en:
Maybe, he wants us to think he's desperate.

Lin Yühsia:
......

Lin Yühsia raises her eyebrows, and leaves it be.

Lin Yühsia:
Right. Have you told Lady Candela about the matter?

Ch'en:
Of course.

Lin Yühsia:
How did she respond?

Ch'en:
You won't do anything... will you?

Candela:
That's right, my girl. You're a smart one. You should be able to figure it out.

Candela:
If I sent someone to inspect the bombs now, wouldn't that just be telling the mastermind I've noticed their schemes?

Ch'en:
I understand.

Candela:
No matter, Ch'en. You and Lin have done very well already.

Candela:
To be frank, at the start I had no expectations you'd find anything at all, hahaha.

Ch'en:
And you don't seem to care?

Candela:
Of course, my girl.

Candela:
And you needn't worry about this too much.

Candela:
I've seen you and Lin put on a very good show in the championship. Why not forget all this, and try your very hardest for number one? You'll put a smile on Wei Yenwu's face too, hahaha.

Ch'en:
We'll take it into consideration.

Ch'en:
You can probably imagine it.

Lin Yühsia:
Easily.

Ch'en:
Now, how do we get out?

Lin Yühsia:
I heard a certain Special Inspection Unit Chief could dice apart a whole building in her rage. Mind showing me first-hand?

Ch'en:
Not every building's so sliceable. This one's clearly built from exceptionally sturdy stuff.

Ch'en:
Can you use your sand ability to transport things?

Lin Yühsia:
I'm not my dad. A blockage of this level, with my ability, would need some time.

Ch'en:
Then I'll have a go.

Lin Yühsia:
No need. I have another method.

Ch'en:
What is it?

Lin Yühsia:
Can you guess what this is?

Ch'en:
...A bomb?

Lin Yühsia:
Do you remember the bomb from the first round?

Lin Yühsia:
There was no way Lady Candela could conduct a wide search, but I had a few of the boys here dress up as thieves and enter the neighborhood to steal as many as they could.

Ch'en:
Thieves?

Lin Yühsia:
Thieves. So long as they gave the guards a bribe, and didn't make too much noise inside, no one would care about them.

Ch'en:
........

Ch'en:
Lin Yühsia.

Lin Yühsia:
What.

Ch'en:
You might be unalike, but I have always deeply respected you and Mr. Lin.

Ch'en:
The slums couldn't go on without you, I know that much.

Lin Yühsia:
And?

Ch'en:
Don't let me catch you enjoying yourself.

Lin Yühsia:
Hui-chieh... nobody would ever assign themselves blame of their own accord.

Lin Yühsia:
Out of the way. I'm going to set the bomb.
