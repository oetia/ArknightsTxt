Ch'en:
Status?

Lin Yühsia:
Going well. I'm almost to the dining room.

Ch'en:
Roger.

Ch'en:
?!

Ernesto:
We meet again, Miss Ch'en.

Ch'en:
You should have stayed in bed.

Ernesto:
I wish I could've done that. I also wish that, when I opened my eyes again, all of this would've been over, win or lose.

Ernesto:
Too bad. I couldn't.

Ch'en:
You can't beat me.

Ernesto:
I'm really glad that I identified you two as my greatest foes right at the beginning... We wouldn't have made it this far otherwise.

Ch'en:
You... You don't seem like those maniacs out there. Why are you doing this?

Ernesto:
Let me tell you how I truly feel, now that it's come to this.

Ernesto:
Ms. Candela once said that her father, a former mayor of this city, was a useless piece of trash who, propped up by the Leithanian government, could do nothing but take bribes.

Ernesto:
Before the outraged citizens could kick his office's door in, he fled the country with his wife and daughter.

Ernesto:
Although her father was a piece of trash through and through, as the daughter of the scumbag, she followed her father first to Kazimierz, then to Victoria.

Ernesto:
Through her father, she learned all the ways that wealth could be used. She learned the very meaning of wealth.

Ernesto:
Then, she came back to the city and became its mayor.

Ernesto:
At a time when the resistance was nothing but a huge failure, the city found itself producing the finest liquor, coffee, and confectionaries.

Ernesto:
Dossoles tequila can even be found in Leithanien and Columbia.

Ernesto:
And while the Leithanians and Columbians were bickering at each other, the city transformed into a vacation hotspot of choice among the elite of both sides.

Ernesto:
They had no choice but to follow Ms. Candela's rule: You may never fight here.

Ernesto:
And it's not military might or prowess that makes them willingly follow this rule. It's wealth, entertainment, and all the luxuries this place has to offer.

Ernesto:
It's the city's colorful facade.

Ernesto:
I know that's not how I should see all this.

Ernesto:
But I can't keep myself from thinking this way—

Ernesto:
From a certain point of view, and all things considered, perhaps Ms. Candela loves this country far more than my father.

Ernesto:
All he is doing is blindly chasing this construct of a country. He wants a country called Bolívar.

Ernesto:
Its borders were defined when it was still a colony. Its citizens are those who have always lived on these lands.

Ernesto:
What comes next? How will this country take on the Columbians and Leithanians in this conflict? How will it continue to develop as a country?

Ernesto:
He doesn't know. He doesn't actually know what kind of a country Bolívar is.

Ernesto:
But Ms. Candela found a path forward. She found meaning in its existence, and she plans to make that meaning a reality.

Ch'en:
That's a load of shit.

Ernesto:
It's better than having nothing but empty promises, no?

Ch'en:
In that case, why help your father?

Ernesto:
From the moment I was born, I've watched my father toil away amid the flames of war. I've watched him go from a spirited man to a quiet one.

Ernesto:
I know what kind of person my father is. He's not like those men who chose to give in to the modern world.

Ernesto:
Even though working under Ms. Candela put these thoughts in my head, that doesn't mean I will betray my father.

Ernesto:
But I also cannot deny that these thoughts are getting stronger and stronger. So much that I'm slowly starting to consider the other possibilities there are.

Ernesto:
That's why this operation is something like a crossroads for me.

Ernesto:
I will wholeheartedly help my father in his cause. If he succeeds, then I will continue to help him.

Ernesto:
If he fails, then I will accept my change of heart and become Ms. Candela's supporter.

Ernesto:
Of course, if I die—

Ernesto:
That just means I'm gonna be dead, haha.

Ernesto:
But now is not the time for all of this to end. Not just yet.

Ernesto:
That's why I can't let you through.

Ch'en:
In that case... we've got nothing to say to each other.

Ernesto:
Right, it's been a pleasure, Miss Ch'en.

Ernesto:
If we'd met under any other circumstance, I would have loved to give you and Miss Lin a proper tour of the city.

Ch'en:
I'll pass.

Ernesto:
I thought you'd say that.

Ship Guard:
B Team, send a few men my way.

Dim-witted Pancho Subordinate:
What's up?

Quick-witted Pancho Subordinate:
You know that team that did really well in the championship, LUNG wRATh? Seems like their girl Ch'en is still putting up a fight.

Dim-witted Pancho Subordinate:
The whole ship's our people, and all the other contestants are here. How is she putting up a fight?

Quick-witted Pancho Subordinate:
Apparently she took Ernesto out.

Quick-witted Pancho Subordinate:
Then she's been running up and down the ship, and now the captain's personally going after her.

Quick-witted Pancho Subordinate:
Heh, that's something, and here I brushed it off when Ernesto told us not to underestimate them.

Dim-witted Pancho Subordinate:
Hm? Speaking of, where's the other girl, Lin?

Dim-witted Pancho Subordinate:
I don't see her among the hostages.

Quick-witted Pancho Subordinate:
Who knows. Probably jumped off the ship.

Lin Yühsia:
You called?

Dim-witted Pancho Subordinate:
?!

Lin Yühsia leaps down from the ceiling above, swiftly dispatching them with two quick chops.

Alert Pancho Subordinate:
Quick! Surround her!

Lin Yühsia:
(Hui-chieh makes good distractions. There's not too many of them here.)

Lin Yühsia:
(Let's get this over with quickly.)

Lin Yühsia:
Come with me if you want to live.

Dignitary:
How are we supposed to escape?! The whole ship's full of Pancho's men!

Lin Yühsia:
You two.

Feeble-minded Contestant:
Eeep—

Headstrong Contestant:
Stop embarrassing yourself. Stand up.

Headstrong Contestant:
Miss Lin, we'll do what you say.

Lin Yühsia:
I'll be the point guard. The rest of you, take care of the bigwigs.

Headstrong Contestant:
Got it.

Lin Yühsia:
Now, then...

Rafaela:
Damn... am I too late...?

Rafaela:
Ernesto said you'd be here. Looks like he was right.

Lin Yühsia:
(Ernesto... Hui-chieh took him out, but he figured the situation right after he came to?)

Lin Yühsia:
(He's a capable man. What a shame.)

Lin Yühsia:
(Still, I didn't expect to run into this little girl again.)

Lin Yühsia:
Little girl, you shouldn't have thrown yourself into this mess.

Rafaela:
My name is Rafaela. I'm not a little girl.

Rafaela:
I may be adopted, but I'm Papa's daughter, so this is exactly the mess I should be in.

Rafaela:
Mi hermano called you a good person. Why are you standing in our way?

Lin Yühsia:
Do you think what you're doing is right?

Rafaela:
I'm not so sure, but Hermano and Papa said the city's a bad place, and I take their word for it.

Lin Yühsia:
You should form your own opinions, little girl. Sometimes, your elders need your help.

Lin Yühsia:
They have experience, and they can be quite insistent on following that experience.

Lin Yühsia:
When it comes time for you to take over, you can't always do as they did in the past.

Lin Yühsia:
You need to use your own reason to break away from their old ways. You need to think about what only you can do.

Rafaela:
I don't understand.

Lin Yühsia:
It's okay, but you should try to remember this.

Lin Yühsia:
Okay, I still have something else to take care of, so it's time for you to be good and go to bed now, little girl.

Ch'en:
(Grr, how dare that Lin Yühsia hang up on me. Now I can't reach her. What the hell is she doing?!)

Ch'en:
Lin Yühsia, what are you even doing? I heard you rescued the hostages like twenty minutes ago, and now most of their men are coming after you.

Lin Yühsia:
I know. I'm not with the hostages right now. My guess is they've gotten out.

Ch'en:
What are you...

Lin Yühsia:
Trust me. Come to the basement. Together, we'll...

Ch'en:
?!

Ch'en puts her phone down and turns around in an instant. Pancho and his men are standing not too far away.

Pancho:
I've heard stories of what an impressive man the Chief of Lungmen Wei Yenwu is.

Pancho:
You may be no less formidable, but neither of you have a clear head, and he sent you two nonetheless.

Pancho:
Looks like Wei Yenwu is no more impressive than Candela.

Ch'en:
You...

Pancho:
You people see nothing but money. There is nothing but leisure on your mind. I can't wait to slaughter all of you.

Pancho:
I don't know what Lungmen is like, but ever since I was born, there's been blood gushing out of Bolívar's veins.

Pancho:
Who doesn't want to shake hands and live in happiness? But none of us here can do that.

Pancho:
Let me tell you this. It doesn't matter how much blood we spill. This city sucks far more blood in a single day!

Pancho:
Alright, I've had enough of your games.

Pancho:
Give it up, or this is where you die.

Ch'en:
(Why are you doing this? Do you really think this is right, in spite of how much more blood you'll spill?)

Ch'en:
(None of those questions matter to him...)

Ch'en:
(In his eyes, I'm the one who's disrupting his plans, and besides—)

Ch'en:
(I can't argue with him.)

Ch'en:
(Not because I regret what I've done.)

Ch'en:
(In fact, it's because I do agree with him, now that I understand his motives.)

Ch'en:
(Even if I disagree with his methods.)

Ch'en:
(But I don't understand Bolívar well enough, and I don't understand war well enough. I can't come up with a better solution.)

Ch'en:
(That's why I can't argue with him.)

Ch'en:
(That's why I can't draw my blade.)

Ch'en:
(Chi Xiao definitely won't accept me as I am now. I can tell.)

Ch'en:
(In that case, there's only one thing I can do—)

Ch'en slowly lifts her gun.

Pancho:
So you have chosen death.

Likewise, Pancho slowly lifts the anchor in his hands.

Right at that moment—

Lin Yühsia:
Jump, Hui-chieh.

Lin Yühsia is waiting underneath with a boat.

Pancho:
Gah, after them!
