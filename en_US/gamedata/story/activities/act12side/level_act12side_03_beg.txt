D.D.D.:
We're already thirty minutes into the contest, and what's shocking is, not a single team who's picked up some gold has chosen to end it yet.

D.D.D.:
I can't help but see wild, wild ambition in these championship contestants!

D.D.D.:
Mr. Pancho, what's your perspective?

Pancho:
Looks to be a fierce championship, this one. One for the ages. Got great expectations for it.

D.D.D.:
No arguments here, I'm sure all of you in the audience feel just the same.

D.D.D.:
Each of our stages will keep following each team's action, so we guarantee you won't miss a single bedazzling fight.

D.D.D.:
And you'd better not relax just yet. We're gonna turn this pressure, this urgency into a force for voting, and give the contestants you love your precious ballot!

D.D.D.:
Once you spend for them, that's when you truly love them!

Sluggish Female Tourist:
My dear, save me!

Impatient Male Tourist:
Don't be afraid, my darling, I'll come rescue you!

Irritated Contestant:
Tsk! I thought the whole lover act was a joke! How do they have so much fight?!

Impatient Male Tourist:
Darling, how fortuitous, I almost thought I'd lose you. (Whisper) Can't you come up with a plan of your own?!

Sluggish Female Tourist:
Ohh, how fearsome they were. (Whisper) My CHARACTER'S a frail girl, huevón!

Impatient Male Tourist:
It's alright, it's all okay now. Watch me teach them a lesson! (Whisper) Tch! Start trying, okay, Miss?

Sluggish Female Tourist:
Oh, my dear, you're the best~ (Whisper) Are you messing with me?!

Lin Yühsia:
(Those two have no uncertainty of skill. And military temperaments on top of it. Perhaps they served in the past.)

Lin Yühsia:
(As for being sweethearts, I presume that's a ploy of sorts, for winning the audience over.)

Lin Yühsia:
(Very aggrandizing, but still a means nonetheless.)

Lin Yühsia:
(Though, still, very aggrandizing.)

Lin Yühsia:
(If that Swire saw this, I'm sure she'd waste no time gushing how she'd like to play a similar role in such a contest.)

Lin Yühsia:
(We're better off not letting her find out.)

Lin Yühsia:
(All in all, this couple has a secure win. Nothing to see there, no gold after a sweep of the area. Time to leave.)

Lin Yühsia:
(Twenty ingots of pure gold. I worry more than a few are in conspicuous places—on top of all the landmarks and such. Those areas will be hotly contested.)

Lin Yühsia:
(Nothing really calls for fighting over those ingots.)

Lin Yühsia:
(I should be searching for the ones left behind in hidden corners.)

Lin Yühsia:
(But... if there are ruffians out to cause chaos under this contest, I'm sure they'd at least find blind spots in the cameras and drones before they do their work.)

Lin Yühsia:
(Both need addressing... I ought to bring it up with Hui-chieh first. Tsk, too quick.)

Lin Yühsia:
(Forget it. I have no desire to discuss anything with that juvenile woman anyway. I'll handle things as they come.)

Ernesto:
Miss Ch'en, can I ask something?

Ch'en:
What?

Ernesto:
You and Miss Lin are old friends, right?

Ch'en:
What makes you think so?

Ernesto:
You certainly don't feel like enemies, there's not that much intensity. But suppose something went down between you two—you still seem pretty well aware of each other.

Ch'en:
You could say that...

Ch'en:
We went to the same primary school, and we had a common acquaintance.

Ch'en:
So your guess is fairly close.

Ch'en:
But I won't be telling you why she and I don't get along.

Ernesto:
That's alright. I can't imagine it's anything minor if it happened between people like you, and I don't plan on asking details. I was just throwing up a topic.

Ernesto:
You know, though, it's like you never imagined she'd show up here.

Ernesto:
Slice it any way you want, it's like it was fated. Have you ever thought about making up with her before?

Ch'en:
Do you care that much about this?

Ernesto:
I don't really... or maybe I do. This city is all just money, money, money 'til the sun goes down. Things like friendship are a huge luxury.

Ch'en:
This isn't something we can just fix... even if either of us wanted to.

Ernesto:
Wait a second. Miss Ch'en, look at that alley there.

Mizuki:
Hm... this is kind of a bind.

Mizuki:
With all these cameras, going too heavy-handed isn't gonna be a good look.

Irritated Contestant:
Rgh, I don't know what it is, but I can't land a good hit on this runt. Something's not right!

Angered Contestant:
He just thinks he can piss around with us. Let's take him together!

Ernesto:
Look at that. It's the solo contestant, stuck in an ambush.

Ernesto:
What's your call, Miss Ch'en? Wait until they finish fighting?

Ch'en:
...No.

Ernesto:
You're going to help him?

Ernesto:
There's no real benefit to it. The championship isn't about helping your fellow contestants—the disciplined approach doesn't fly here.

Ch'en:
I know. Just stay here and wait for me a moment.

And as promptly as that, Ch'en has already dashed out.

Ernesto:
......

Ernesto is silent for a moment, and doesn't follow.

Lin Yühsia:
(They've even installed cameras in crevices like this. These can't have been just for the competition.)

Lin Yühsia:
(But even so, the residential housing ought not to have surveillance in it. I'm guessing drones will only film interiors if they capture contestants going in.)

Lin Yühsia:
(In other words, as long as you're not physically filmed entering, there's a high chance officials won't notice you.)

Lin Yühsia:
(If you exploit that fact... hm?)

Lin Yühsia:
(...Heh. Speak and it shall come.)

Rafaela:
What's the status?

Contestant?:
Bombs are all set on our end, Rafaela.

Rafaela:
Good. I'm done here too.

Rafaela:
Let's move to the next location.

Contestant?:
Hold on, I just got a distress from C-team. Seems like they're really struggling with an opponent there.

Rafaela:
Who is it?

Contestant?:
It's Ch'en from the LUNG wRATh team.

Rafaela:
Hermano told us not to take on what we can't handle.

Rafaela:
Move a nearby team to them, don't stand out too much. Give it up if it's a losing battle, don't keep fighting out of obligation. Our actual job takes priority.

Contestant?:
Got it.

Lin Yühsia:
(...She was being serious.)

Lin Yühsia:
(I never imagined the girl would be one of them.)

Lin Yühsia:
(I imagine, by 'actual job,' they mean more of these bombs, and it sounds as if there are several teams on it.)

Lin Yühsia:
(The officials might have prohibited comms equipment, but all signs indicate they have their own way of keeping in touch, under the radar.)

Lin Yühsia:
(And there's no knowing if they have a plan B. I'm worried there won't be much meaning in keeping on their trail, and there's the risk of being found.)

Lin Yühsia:
(Two things stood out: 'Bombs', 'Hermano'. They can play into our knowledge. Having these few keywords should be sufficient for now.)

Lin Yühsia:
(...It's about time to rendezvous, too. Perfect chance to see how Hui-chieh's done.)

Though not cleared out for the competition, it's an ordinarily lonely alleyway, but right this moment it's host to sheer hubbub.

From roofs, windowsills, balconies, fencetops, ill-meaning contestants are all icily fixed on the figure stood in the dead center—Ch'en.

She is completely unshaken. She simply grips her water gun tight.

At the entrance, together with Ernesto stands Mizuki, who has just been saved by Ch'en. Mizuki's face tells of happy surprise, but Ernesto wears hesitance.

However, in this moment, they are beyond anyone's attention.

Silent throughout the alley, it's as if the air is just as frozen.

Only one sole scrap of proof that the wet air blows through the tips of their hair, that this charged scene isn't just a still image.

'Drip-drop.'

Somewhere unknown, a loosely shut faucet drips water, the droplets striking the basin, the noise minute. The noise, nevertheless, is like a stone breaking a placid lake's surface.

In a split-second, the contestants around her all swarm in, and Ch'en takes her opening steps.

Atop a roof, Lin Yühsia calmly confirms the situation surrounding.

Lin Yühsia:
(There she is, playing at the hero again.)

Lin Yühsia:
(She'll spend eternity without learning to behave. I'm not bothered to help her.)

Lin Yühsia:
(That said, the commotion's audible enough for some teams in the vicinity to make for here.)

Lin Yühsia:
(...I suppose I'll hold them off. Drawing too many people's attention won't do any good.)

Lin Yühsia loosens her wrists, hops down from the roof, and lands squarely at the alley entrance.

Not far away, figures are already coming into sight. She takes in a tiny breath, and assumes her stance.
