D.D.D.:
Contestant Mizuki gave up obstructing the ambush, headed on top of the arms shop ruins where Ch'en and Lin are buried, halted for a moment and then vanished without a trace.

D.D.D.:
All of our surveillance and drones have been unable to locate him.

D.D.D.:
And of the teams at the head, Honey Summer has become the first to reach the swimming checkpoint.

D.D.D.:
All the other teams up front are successively passing through, too.

D.D.D.:
And as for our most arresting LUNG wRATh, Ernesto has already been toppled at the rear, and our staff have judged that he's lost the ability to fight on.

D.D.D.:
Ch'en and Lin, our two heroines, still show no signs of movement.

D.D.D.:
Could this truly be where it all ends?!

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, you're kidding, right? This can't be the place, can it?

Eyjafjalla:
Miss Hoshiguma really cares a lot about the competition.

Swire:
As if. She's got a ton of money riding on Ch'en. That's all.

Swire:
They've known each other for so long now. Who cares whether she wins or loses a competition like this?

Swire:
Losing doesn't just mean something's up, and winning isn't gonna prove anything.

Swire:
I'm hoping she loses, really. That's the excuse I need to make fun of her.

Swire:
Here, Eyjafjalla. Closer. Let me try this facial cream on you. I think it'll make you look great.

Eyjafjalla:
Alright, then. Thank you.

Suddenly, another boom resounds, coming from the screen whose shot is fixed on Ernesto's arms shop.

D.D.D.:
Hold on, could it be...

Onscreen, smoke pours forth, and out from it, pushing a bicycle, Ch'en and Lin Yühsia emerge.

D.D.D.:
They're out, they're out! They're finally out!

D.D.D.:
Ch'en and Lin once again stand on the competition stage!

D.D.D.:
However, the two only have one bicycle left, and the swimming checkpoint is still a distance away. And at this point, the lead pack have already started on the swim.

D.D.D.:
Do LUNG wRATh really still have a chance?

Ch'en:
Get moving. I'll run.

Lin Yühsia:
Hop on.

Ch'en:
?

Lin Yühsia:
Don't make me repeat myself. Hop on.

Ch'en:
You're sure?

Lin Yühsia:
I'll ride, you sort out anyone in the way.

D.D.D.:
It's so beautiful. They only have one bicycle left, but Lin refuses to leave Ch'en behind.

D.D.D.:
She's having Ch'en stand on her own bike's back seat, and as she cycles, Ch'en is ready to handle anyone with a mind to obstruct them.

D.D.D.:
Two people, one single bicycle, and an act of perfect coordination to leave us all in awe!

D.D.D.:
Dare I say that right now, their combination is the mightiest in this whole championship!

Lin Yühsia:
You stepped on my hair.

Ch'en:
Enemies in front. I can't help it.

Ch'en:
Can you stop twisting?

Lin Yühsia:
Why don't you try pedaling?

Ch'en suddenly pushes Lin Yühsia's head down, narrowly avoiding a head-on collision with a tire.

Lin Yühsia then lifts her head back up, and fiercely knocks it into Ch'en's face.

Ch'en:
Yühsia, you—!

Lin Yühsia:
Accident.

D.D.D.:
LUNG wRATh have broken through the final stretch at breakneck speeds, and reached the beach.

D.D.D.:
The swimming checkpoint is right before their eyes.

D.D.D.:
But the other teams clearly won't let them through that easily.

D.D.D.:
A vicious beach battle is about to commence!
