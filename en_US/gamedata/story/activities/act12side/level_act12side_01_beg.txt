Ch'en:
(There's about as many people as Siesta, but the atmosphere's completely different.)

Ch'en:
(Everywhere I look, bars, casinos, restaurants...)

Flighty Tourist:
Hey, pretty lady, wanna come join us on the beach?

Ch'en:
Piss. Off.

Ch'en:
(Lin Yühsia vanished into thin air this morning.)

Swire:
I was just about to give that stinky sewer rat another call.

Swire:
I may not come here often, but I'm pretty sure those special forces are up to no good.

Ch'en:
Have you met Lin? From the slums?

Swire:
I have. He's a nice old man. Nicer than my grandpa anyway.

Ch'en:
They call him the 'Rat King.'

Swire:
Aren't the men behind the curtain all like such? But he's really a good person.

Swire:
I never thought Yühsia would turn out like this. She was such a shy and timid girl, the kind who would always hide behind you.

Ch'en:
I don't think she's changed. She just... took on responsibility. Maybe the kind she couldn't handle.

Ch'en:
(Whatever, she can't hide for long.)

Ch'en:
*sigh*. I'm already here. May as well find something to do.

Ch'en:
(Like what... buy some Dossoles goodies?)

Ch'en:
(It'd be kind of complicated to ship souvenirs to Hoshiguma and Swire... I'll just wait for them to visit Rhodes Island.)

Ch'en:
(Right, I need to get a thank-you gift for Lady Fumizuki too.)

Ch'en:
(As for the Rhodes Islanders... Shirayuki, Bagpipe, Amiya, and... her?)

Ch'en:
(Whatever. It's a lot of people to buy for, and I don't know if I can carry that much back. We'll see how things go.)

Ch'en:
(But I get the feeling this won't need too long...)

Ch'en:
(Should I go for a walk...? I guess I'll be walking, no matter what I do.)

Ch'en:
(Maybe have Ernesto give me a quick tour of the city?)

Ch'en:
(Nah... I don't know him well enough.)

Ch'en:
(Right, there was what Mayor Candela said...)

Candela:
These past few days, circulation of weapons in the city has grown unusually prevalent. If you feel you aren't having as much fun as you'd like at any point during your stay here, perhaps you should try your hand at the investigation. For fun.

Ch'en:
(For a mayor, she clearly doesn't care one bit about her own city. How did Wei Yenwu get a friend like that?)

Ch'en:
(And besides, this city is one big luxury resort. It practically defines 'decadent'...)

Ch'en:
(This place is more Swire's speed. I'd rather be back in Siesta.)

Ch'en:
(Ugh, what—ever. I'm here already, and investigating's better than nothing. Let's give it a fair shake.)

Ch'en:
(I could ask Ernesto about Mayor Candela's case, but if they had any definite leads, something would've happened long ago.)

Ch'en:
(Just asking won't get me anywhere. Roaming it is. Start by getting the lay of the land.)

Chagrined Male Tourist:
How was the fight last night?

Cheerful Male Tourist:
Won a few thousand. You?

Chagrined Male Tourist:
Ugh. I lost bad.

Cheerful Male Tourist:
Ha ha, no biggie. Just win it back today, right?

Chagrined Male Tourist:
Conchetumare, I was gonna, even if you didn't say. It's just better here. No way I wanna go back.

Cheerful Male Tourist:
I hear you. Once we get out of this place, it's back to death and gore again.

Cheerful Male Tourist:
Damn, you know? If we just had the money to buy an apartment here.

Chagrined Male Tourist:
Win enough bets and we will, yeah?

Cheerful Male Tourist:
Ha ha ha, you got me there!

Upbeat Bartender:
Excuse me, lovely young lady, could I interest you in a job at our bar?

Upbeat Bartender:
A woman as gorgeous as you could make crazy money in one night.

Ch'en:
Piss. Off.

Ch'en:
Casinos, bars, restaurants, karaoke boxes. Is that all they ever built in this city?

???:
...The preliminary phase is near its end.

Ch'en turns to look, and realizes the voice is coming from a display TV in a shop window.

TV Presenter:
Locals and visitors from afar, are you having the vacation time of your lives?

TV Presenter:
I lost three hundred thousand at the casino last night, but you bet I'm gonna win it back today.

TV Presenter:
So, after ten days of fierce competition, the Dossoles Warrior Champion holds its final prelim contest today!

TV Presenter:
And this afternoon at 3 P.M.—that's in three hours, folks—we'll be treated to the final Smash Splash Prelim!

TV Presenter:
It's a bout you championship-lovers absolutely cannot miss! Be there, and bathe in the excitement!

TV Presenter:
But of course, there's no need to panic if you don't wanna fight the scorching heat or the crowds! Keep your eyes on our official channel, and we'll have live coverage for you!

TV Presenter:
And before we forget, we've got some news for you music-heads that'll shake the world.

TV Presenter:
That's right, you've probably already heard—in a huge move, Mayor Candela has invited the Monster Siren Records legend, D.D.D.

TV Presenter:
And that's not all. The masked musician's unleashing more than her bold electro. She's going to be hosting the championship!

Impatient Male Tourist:
Nina, c'mon, didn't you hear that? Three hours until the match starts.

Sluggish Female Tourist:
What's so fun about a fight? It's barbarous.

Impatient Male Tourist:
Anyone who passes the scrimmage prelim ends up a dark horse in the championship. It's something you've gotta keep tabs on.

Sluggish Female Tourist:
Then you go watch. Tell me what happens.

Impatient Male Tourist:
Come on, lady... pft, fine. I'll go on my own, then, suit yourself.

Male Music-Loving Tourist:
Hey, you think it's true? I heard D.D.D. was coming a few days ago, but I had no idea if it's for real.

Female Music-Loving Tourist:
If I'm remembering right, she was in Siesta just last month. Wild that she's here in Dossoles now.

Female Music-Loving Tourist:
And how do you even get her to host your thing? What did Mayor Candela say to win her over?!

Male Music-Loving Tourist:
Her?

Female Music-Loving Tourist:
You didn't know? We got strong odds nowadays that D.D.D.'s a female artist.

Male Music-Loving Tourist:
Huh... doesn't mean much to me if she's a man or a woman. What really matters is our ears are in for a treat!

Ch'en realizes that practically everyone is talking about the competition.

Ch'en:
........

Ch'en:
(Seems it's gripped the whole city.)

Ch'en:
(If you want to get something done here, what better way than to go undercover as a competitor? Think of all the opportunities you could make out of the chaos.)

Ch'en:
(And in that case...)

Ernesto:
Hey, is that Miss Ch'en? Haha, sorry, I'm a little tied up on this end right now.

Ernesto:
Hiyah!

Sound from Receiver:
Gaagh!

Ch'en:
Are you fighting with someone? What's going on?

Ernesto:
It's a long story. The short version is Miss Lin is having trouble making friends.

Ch'en:
Where are you? I'll come over.

Ernesto:
Sure, I'm at...

Three hours ago

Lin Yühsia:
......

Ch'en:
Why did you help him?

Lin Yühsia:
Juvenile.

Ernesto:
Need me to assist, Miss Lin?

Lin Yühsia:
You said you were very familiar with this city.

Ernesto:
I am.

Lin Yühsia:
Any options for a small, independent, quiet casino?

Ernesto:
Independent, quiet... You want the kind of place where you can make trouble without it blowing up?

Ernesto:
No worries, then. With Ms. Candela around, no one will dare get in your way.

Lin Yühsia:
No. I want the kind that won't be a pain to tidy up.

Ernesto:
...I get you.

Lin Yühsia:
This is the place?

Ernesto:
Right. A casino bar, more precisely.

Ernesto:
The proprietor, Arraz, started it from nothing. Gave it everything he had to make it on this street, and got the place to where it is today.

Ernesto:
The powers on the streets around all want it for themselves, but nobody's got the teeth to break through his bones.

Lin Yühsia:
Excellent.

Lin Yühsia:
You wait here.

Casino Hotshot:
May I ask if you're here to drink, or to play a hand?

Lin Yühsia:
To play a hand.

Casino Hotshot:
T-Tough lady we got here...

Casino Hotshot:
Q-Quick, call the boss!

Casino Boss:
Miss, I don't care who you are, but you're too big for your britches, all alone and rowdy in a place like this.

Lin Yühsia:
Cut the drivel. Deal.

Casino Boss:
Quads. Heheheh...

Lin Yühsia:
Straight flush.

Casino Boss:
How?!

Lin Yühsia:
You're awful at palming cards.

Casino Boss:
Miss, I'll admit you might have some real skill...

Lin Yühsia:
Can we speed this up? Draw, already. I'm in a hurry.

Casino Boss:
Grr. It's go time, boys!

Ernesto:
Well, I did familiarize myself with her...

Ernesto:
But this is the way the Rat King's daughter does things.

Ch'en:
Where's Lin Yühsia?

Ernesto:
You're here, Miss Ch'en.

Ernesto:
That bunch ran after they couldn't handle Miss Lin. She went to chase them down.

Ch'en:
Which way?

Ernesto:
That way, towards the beach.

Ch'en:
Got it. I'll go check it out.

Lin Yühsia:
They sprint fast, I'll give them that.

Ch'en:
Lin Yühsia, what the hell are you doing?

Lin Yühsia:
Ch'en Hui-chieh? What are you doing here?

Ch'en:
I'm the one asking you.

Casino Boss:
Gah, where'd this nutcase pop up from? We can't beat her, we can't shake her off.

Casino Hotshot:
Boss, what do we do?

Casino Boss:
What else? Keep running.

Casino Boss:
Hm?

Casino Boss:
Is that... where they're hosting the scrimmage prelim?

Casino Boss:
Heh, perfect. We're going in!

Lin Yühsia:
Found them.

Lin Yühsia:
No time to babysit you right now.

Ch'en:
Hold it!

Lin Yühsia:
There you are.

Casino Boss:
You even found us here?

Casino Boss:
Hmph. Good thing we've got plenty of help on hand.

Casino Boss:
Guys, let's go!

Ch'en:
Where are we...? Isn't this the Smash Splash place they mentioned on TV?

Ch'en:
Grr. I guess we'll have to clear the field first.
