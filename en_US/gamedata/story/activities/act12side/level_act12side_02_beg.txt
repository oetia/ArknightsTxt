D.D.D.:
Welcome, dear audience, to the eve of your mightily awaited Eighth Dossoles Warrior Champion!

D.D.D.:
Before we part the curtains, why don't we invite our beloved Mayor Candela up for the opening speech?

Candela:
Citizens, tourists, with great pride in this city, I welcome you to Dossoles!

Candela:
It doesn't matter where you're from. It doesn't matter who you are.

Candela:
You've made it here, so let all that fall away.

Candela:
Enjoy everything our city has to give you. Enjoy everything you deserve.

Candela:
Be happy, laugh happy, shout and scream happy.

Candela:
This is the paradise I built, and it's all for you!

Candela:
Now come! The most unforgettable time of your life is here for the taking!

D.D.D.:
Okay, big thank-you to Mayor Candela for that speech, just as sempiternally scorched with passion, alright. Moving on, time to introduce your contestants.

D.D.D.:
Lots of familiar faces this year and last year, but plenty of new ones too!

D.D.D.:
First order of business, they look like a lovey-dovey couple, they ARE a lovey-dovey couple, but they're a force on the fighting front!

D.D.D.:
Honey Summer!

Impatient Male Tourist:
The power of love brought us together.

Sluggish Female Tourist:
The power of love brought us our love.

Male & Female Tourist:
The power of our love is unmatched!

D.D.D.:
Even I can barely stand before that sparkly power of love! Let's see just how far love's legs can run!

D.D.D.:
Solo unit up next, the contestant who won the Stomach King Prelims, Mizuki!

D.D.D.:
Harmless as he looks, he ate through an entire restaurant warehouse. That bottomless stomach and that blue hair are begging to synergize with the ocean here.

D.D.D.:
Pacer-man!

Mizuki:
Hallo, hallo, hey everyone.

D.D.D.:
Contestant Mizuki, would you like to say a few words to stir the hearts of the people?

Mizuki:
Hm... I'll eat you all up once I'm tired of playing.

D.D.D.:
Ooooh! Contestant Mizuki, utterer of terrifying statements in completely normal voices! We look forward to seeing you out there!

D.D.D.:
Next up, it's a local team, led by Miss Rafaela, who may look cute, but she's got a giant, fiendish sickle. That's the kind of contrast this team's here to feed you.

D.D.D.:
Let's welcome up—the Grey Feathers!

Rafaela:
Hello to you all.

D.D.D.:
Miss Rafaela, what do you have to say before the tournament?

Rafaela:
Um... I'll do my best.

D.D.D.:
Ooh, alright, alright, sometimes it's the simple things that touch us deep! Grey Feathers, I think you'll go far!

D.D.D.:
Right after that, it's a newcomer to this competition, but the team that's drawn the most buzz!

D.D.D.:
They're the live scrimmage gatecrashers, winners with an attitude no-one could answer, the supernovas who've picked up Mr. Pancho's support!

D.D.D.:
They came from a place the City of Two Suns loves dearly—the Lungmen heroines, Miss Lin Yühsia, Miss Ch'en Hui-chieh, and we even get the local arms dealer, Mr. Ernesto, completing this team—

D.D.D.:
—LUNG wRATh!

D.D.D.:
Strong, fresh teams spike an appetite like nothing else, and their odds are sitting high! But! Do you truly dare to put your chips down on them?

Ch'en:
*Sigh*.

Lin Yühsia:
Hah.

D.D.D.:
Alright, let's get your statement. Team leader?

Lin Yühsia:
Who's the leader?

Ch'en:
Ernesto, you do it.

Ernesto:
What?

Ch'en:
There's no way Lin Yühsia's going to take what I say.

Lin Yühsia:
And you wouldn't take what I say either.

Ernesto:
Er, alright.

Ernesto:
In that case, we proclaim—we're going to carve our mark into this competition's history!

Ernesto:
How was that?

Ch'en:
Mediocre.

Lin Yühsia:
Agreed.

Ernesto:
Thought so.

D.D.D.:
Massively assertive! Let's look forward to LUNG wRATh and their vivid display.

D.D.D.:
Moving on, our next team is...

Hoshiguma:
Hey, Missy, this way.

Swire:
Coming! Hey, watch my ice cream!

Swire:
Really, this crowd is insane...

Hoshiguma:
Just goes to show how much attention's on this contest.

Hoshiguma:
Anyway, you see that? Ch'en's carrying some gun-ish thing for some reason.

Hoshiguma:
Guess she's not planning to use her sword this time.

Swire:
She's set herself up badly, hasn't she? She was about as good at firearms training as I was.

Hoshiguma:
Wow. Excellence doesn't just grow on trees, okay?

Swire:
Calling her swordsmanship 'excellent' undersells it.

Hoshiguma:
Hey, Missy, I gotta say, you're an even bigger Ch'en fan than me, behind her back.

Swire:
I'm just stating facts, okay.

Hoshiguma:
Yeah, yeah. More importantly, though, seeing Ch'en without a sword is a sight to treasure. Let's go ask the organizers if we can get a recording of this.

Swire:
Let's not. That would be hell.

Hoshiguma:
What's to be so embarrassed about? We'll cut it into a flick. I've already got the title. It'll be 'Gunslinger Old Ch'en Grasps Great Lung Power.'

Swire:
And I gotta say, you might have a talent for directing awful B movies.

Hoshiguma:
I'm flattered. Oh, right, Missy. I've got something to talk to you about.

Swire:
Not happening.

Hoshiguma:
C'mon, I haven't even said what it is.

Swire:
You said 'something to talk about' and I nearly threw up my ice cream. Nothing good comes out of that phrasing.

Hoshiguma:
Hey. No, just, I saw the officials here had an event on for the spectators.

Hoshiguma:
I looked into it. They let you guess who'll win. And there's a bunch of smaller ones, like who'll be first to get gold, who'll get eliminated earliest, and...

Swire:
The way you use the word 'guess' absolutely floors me.

Hoshiguma:
It's government-sponsored. Ship-shape and legal.

Swire:
Ugh. What even goes for illegal in this city?

Hoshiguma:
Yeah... good point, but right now we're just regular tourists, y'know? It's beyond our job descriptions.

Swire:
I know.

Hoshiguma:
And look, even if you want to laugh at Ch'en and Miss Lin, just suppose they do win, we won't be out of pocket, right?

Hoshiguma:
Makes it a win-win, Missy.

Swire:
Sigh*... I give in. Here's my card.

Hoshiguma:
Mighty thanks, Milady.

Swire:
Don't go splashing it about!

Hoshiguma:
I hear you.

D.D.D.:
Alright, that's all forty teams.

D.D.D.:
Cameras and drones will capture the whole thing, ensuring you don't miss a single beautiful shot.

D.D.D.:
And this main stage isn't gonna stand alone, either. The officials have set up ten more, each one with its own dedicated presenter.

D.D.D.:
So you'll get every second, and with commentary just as brilliant to match.

D.D.D.:
Plus, once the opening ceremony begins, we've got a little wagering opportuntiy for you audience-siders, to make the competition that much spicier.

D.D.D.:
All spectators are invited to register your info on the government site, and you can make yourself a little extra cash!

D.D.D.:
For specifics on how it'll work, refer to your government-issued competition guides.

D.D.D.:
Now, then. All the competitors are in our starting district and readied up.

D.D.D.:
Round 1 will be a search—and a struggle—for pure gold in a partitioned-off area. Teams will then hand it directly to staff at the finish point.

D.D.D.:
But, they're also allowed to shoot for more! Whatever gold they get belongs to them!

D.D.D.:
Alright! Mayor Candela, fire off the salute and signal the start of this competition!

Candela:
I declare—Round 1 has officially begun!

Lin Yühsia:
What now?

Ch'en:
We split up.

Lin Yühsia:
And avoid working together. It seems we have yet another common understanding.

Lin Yühsia:
However, before that. We're already being watched.

Ch'en:
We break out first.

Lin Yühsia:
Good.

D.D.D.:
Oooh, Round 1 of the championship has begun, and the highly anticipated LUNG wRATh has had three other teams cooperate to target them!

D.D.D.:
Either side is poised to fight!

D.D.D.:
Will LUNG wRATh once again show their true power, or will the teams united take the win? Let's hold on tight!
