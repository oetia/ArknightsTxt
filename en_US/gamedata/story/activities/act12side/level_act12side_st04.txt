D.D.D.:
Phew...

Manager:
Hey, D.D.D. You're finally awake.

D.D.D.:
Waking up after catching some Z's is pretty normal, no?

Manager:
You crashed straight into bed the moment you got back last night, though. That really had me worrying.

D.D.D.:
How are things looking outside?

Manager:
If you're asking about the city, it's just like before. Bustling.

Manager:
I heard a lot of people talking about what happened yesterday while I was having breakfast. Didn't seem like they care much, though.

D.D.D.:
Well, things already got pretty watered down.

D.D.D.:
Mayor Candela's amazing.

D.D.D.:
With all that went down, nobody could've seen that coming.

Manager:
I was really shocked when I saw it on TV too.

Manager:
I've never seen anyone calm things down like that.

Manager:
And quite a few people actually went and fought the terrorists.

D.D.D.:
I was right there. It just felt so bizarre.

D.D.D.:
Some of the terrorists were going straight after Ms. Candela, and they were really close.

D.D.D.:
But she didn't even seem to care about that. All she cared about was getting the drones to the ship so she could get a good look at the action there.

D.D.D.:
She was just standing, pointing at the screen and the sea while talking to the other spectators around her.

D.D.D.:
It was like nothing that was happening was real.

D.D.D.:
Then, those two girls showed up.

D.D.D.:
It was like them being there dragged everything back to reality.

D.D.D.:
It was so... so exciting!

Manager:
So you want to create something.

D.D.D.:
Ahaha, you know me well.

Manager:
How long have we known each other?

D.D.D.:
Yeah, that's right. I wanna create. I want to write a song that to document the fear, gratefulness, confusion that I feel right here right now.

D.D.D.:
This is a song I'm writing for myself, but it's got to do with them.

Mizuki:
On its own, this city is a decent place.

Mizuki:
Leithanien's musicals, Columbia's movies, and Bolívar's coffee. I've got to experience everything I wanted to try.

Mizuki:
But the people here are so boring. I got tired of playing with them about halfway through the competition.

Mizuki:
If I'd known this is how it would turn out in the end, I would've boarded the ship with Miss Ch'en after I made sure she was alright. I probably could've helped her that way.

Mizuki:
Oh well, I'm starting to be sick of this city. Maybe I'll check out wherever Miss Ch'en's going.

Mizuki:
I bet there are just as many nice people like her where she comes from.

Ch'en:
That's way too reckless of you, Swire.

Swire:
Uh-huh, yeah yeah yeah, okay, yeah. Fine, I got it. Why do I have to sit here and listen to you reprimand me again?

Ch'en:
I left the L.G.D. in your hands, and you...

Swire:
Oh, I know what I'm doing.

Swire:
Besides, what about you? I thought you jumped ship to Rhodes Island to be an operator there, but here you are on a holiday!

Ch'en:
I'm... Fine, you're right.

Swire:
Hmph.

Hoshiguma:
Come on, keep going. Why did you stop? I don't even remember the last time you two had an argument.

Swire:
We had one last time I went to Rhodes Island.

Hoshiguma:
Eh, anyway, we're all here, and we got everything wrapped up. We should put all the unpleasant things behind us and have some fun instead.

Hoshiguma:
Right, Ch'en?

Ch'en:
*Sigh*... right.

Hoshiguma:
What's wrong? Are you still thinking about yesterday?

Ch'en:
Yeah. I might've received the one honor that I don't ever want to receive in my entire life.

Hoshiguma:
Haha, true. To be honest with you, even I thought that was pretty nasty.

Hoshiguma:
But it happened nonetheless.

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, there's not a whole lot in the world that goes exactly as you want but can still be called an absolute win for all parties concerned.

Ch'en:
I know.

Swire:
Okay, enough. If we're just gonna sit here and talk, we might as well go get some shopping done and stuff our faces with food to cheer ourselves up.

Swire:
Let's go. I'm paying for lunch.

Swire:
Now where's that stupid rat?

Hoshiguma:
I think I saw her heading out early in the morning. Not sure where, though.

Ch'en:
I have an inkling where she might be. I'll go find her.

Swire:
Let me know when you do.

Swire:
Hmph, she's been hiding from me since last night. She's dead as soon as I find her, I'm telling you.

Lin Yühsia:
I'm leaving you in charge of the place once I'm gone.

Lin Yühsia:
You remember everything I taught you, right?

Casino Boss:
Of course. You can rest assured it's in good hands.

Ch'en:
What are you two chatting about?

Casino Boss:
Oh, Miss Ch'en. The boss is lecturing us right now.

Lin Yühsia:
Don't tell her that. She might arrest you.

Ch'en:
I'm not a cop anymore.

Lin Yühsia:
I've never seen such a big busybody of a tourist.

Ch'en:
Hmph.

Lin Yühsia:
Leave us.

Casino Boss:
Of course.

Lin Yühsia:
Do you need something?

Lin Yühsia:
I doubt you looked everywhere just to have a drink with me.

Ch'en:
What if I tell you that's what I'm doing?

Lin Yühsia:
Then... let's have a drink.

Ch'en:
I know the President of the Lungmen Young Entrepreneurs' Association to be a decisive, resolute person, strict on both herself and others.

Ch'en:
And now I've finally seen her decisiveness for myself.

Lin Yühsia:
And the L.G.D. Special Inspection Unit Chief I know is an impartial person who shows criminals absolutely no mercy.

Lin Yühsia:
I finally had the pleasure to meet her.

Ch'en:
Did Wei Yenwu send you here?

Lin Yühsia:
Lady Fumizuki sent me here as his representative.

Lin Yühsia:
At first, I didn't understand why, but I figured it out when I saw you.

Ch'en:
You aren't mad?

Lin Yühsia:
Not at all. This is an opportunity for me.

Lin Yühsia:
The Rat King's daughter won't necessarily become the Rat King. But that also means she could be.

Ch'en:
So that's why you helped him?

Lin Yühsia:
I won't answer that, Hui-chieh.

Ch'en:
Why not?

Lin Yühsia:
Because I'm not like you.

Ch'en:
You want to say I abandoned Lungmen.

Lin Yühsia:
The thought did cross my mind at first, but not anymore.

Lin Yühsia:
This is a simple declarative sentence. I am not like you.

Ch'en:
That kind of grates on my ears.

Lin Yühsia:
That's your problem.

Ch'en:
Hoh.

Swire:
Hey, did you find that stinking rat yet?

Ch'en:
She's right here.

Swire:
Where are you?

Ch'en:
In a bar on Coastal Highway 26.

Swire:
The 26? Perfect. I see a decent place there. I'll send you the address. You two head on over and get us a table.

Swire:
And drag that ngong gau lou syu there if you have to. Don't let her get away.

Ch'en:
You heard her.

Lin Yühsia:
*Sigh*... Will that woman ever be less of a pain?

Ch'en:
Shall we go?

Lin Yühsia:
Let's go.

Ch'en:
That's quite a lot of people on the beach.

Lin Yühsia:
The ship's one of the city's symbols. Now that it's sunk, people here are bound to be curious.

Ch'en:
The cruise ship, huh?

Lin Yühsia:
It doesn't matter what you think about it. We are the ones who blew it up. That's the truth.

Lin Yühsia:
We should be thankful that Lady Candela wrote it off in exchange for our prize money.

Ch'en:
To be precise, you blew it up.

Lin Yühsia:
You had a better idea?

Ch'en:
No.

Ch'en:
Hmm? Who's that over there...?

Ernesto:
......

Lin Yühsia:
Ernesto?

Ernesto:
Miss Ch'en, Miss Lin.

Ch'en:
What are you doing here?

Ernesto:
Ms. Candela spared everyone except my father. Most of us are being exiled.

Ernesto:
She's only letting me stay because of my service in the past few years. Of course, I'm most definitely losing my job.

Ch'en:
You're thinking of staying?

Ernesto:
No, I'm planning to leave.

Ernesto:
Rafaela and I are trying to figure out where to go. I spent the whole night thinking and still don't have anything. That's why I'm sitting here, gazing out at the sea to see if it gives me any ideas.

Lin Yühsia:
Rafaela is the little girl?

Ernesto:
That's right. She's the daughter of my father's old war friend, tío Pugh. He died rescuing my father from prison and entrusted her to him before he died.

Ch'en:
......

Ernesto:
Have you two given killing me here on the spot any thought?

Ch'en:
I don't have the right to pass judgment on you, yet.

Lin Yühsia:
Had you succeeded, I'd kill you the moment we saw each other again. As for right now... I'll pass.

Ernesto:
Haha, it's just like you two to say stuff like that.

Ernesto:
Miss Ch'en, Miss Lin, I suppose, in Yan, they'd call me an unfilial son?

Lin Yühsia:
Yes.

Ch'en:
We could also say you betrayed your father in the name of righteousness, but you aren't there yet.

Ernesto:
Hahaha, you're right. There wasn't anything righteous about what I did.

Ernesto:
The thought of betraying my father never crossed my mind during this operation, though.

Ernesto:
Do you remember what I told you on the ship, Miss Ch'en? That wasn't a lie.

Ernesto:
I'm not sure if this has crossed your mind during your time here.

Ernesto:
I know very well what this city was built on top of.

Ernesto:
However, whenever I look at the skyscrapers and the blue sky up above, I can't help but feel that there is some sort of legitimacy to it.

Ernesto:
I can't think of it any other way.

Ch'en:
But you choose to leave now.

Ernesto:
To tell the truth, if it wasn't for you two, I think I would willingly stay here and work under her.

Ernesto:
But your words left me bewildered.

Ernesto:
You two are foreigners. Perhaps, elsewhere, things could have been different.

Ernesto:
Phew... It feels much better now that I got that off my chest.

Ernesto:
Thank you for not bludgeoning me to death the moment you saw me, much less listening to me talk about all this.

Lin Yühsia:
It's all a matter of perspective.

Ernesto:
Well, I'm done bothering you. I will likely be around for a little longer. Please don't hesitate to come to me if you need me for anything.

Ch'en:
Alright.

Lin Yühsia:
I can't help him...

Ch'en:
Neither can... What do you mean?

Lin Yühsia:
I just think it's a pity to leave him wallowing in misery like that.

Ch'en:
I'll think about it...

Hoshiguma:
Hey, Ch'en.

Ch'en:
Hello.

Sideroca:
We were just leaving the city hall, and Ms. Swire here invited us to lunch with you.

Ch'en:
I see. How did your talks with the mayor go?

Sideroca:
Thanks to you, we've played a role in this little incident. The mayor didn't think twice before she agreed.

Ch'en:
It's just like her to do that.

Swire:
Finally caught you, you stupid rat!

Lin Yühsia:
I wasn't running away. Perhaps you've got a few loose screws, Beatrix.

Swire:
You're the one who's got loose screws!

Lin Yühsia:
Most girls aren't so jealous of their friends going on a holiday that they follow them there in secret.

Swire:
I'm built different!

Lin Yühsia:
*Sigh*...

Hoshiguma:
Right, Missy said we'll be going shopping in the afternoon. Grabbing souvenirs, too, while we're at it. Ch'en, Miss Lin, how about it?

Ch'en:
Sure.

Swire:
The stupid rat has to come.

Lin Yühsia:
Fine, I don't have much else to do.

Swire:
Let's go get lunch, then.

Sideroca:
Hm?

Sideroca:
Hey, you four, come. Pose for me.

Hoshiguma:
What's the matter?

Sideroca:
It just occurred to me this could make a really great picture. I'll snap one for you. Something like a memento of your holiday.

Swire:
Sounds lovely. Hey, ugly rat, it's time for a picture. Get in.

Lin Yühsia:
*Sigh*... Whatever.

Hoshiguma:
Haha, it's not often that the four of us get to spend time together. How about it, Ch'en?

Ch'en:
Sure.

Sideroca:
Alright. 3, 2, 1, cheese—!

Fumizuki:
Are you reading Yühsia's report on her trip to Dossoles?

Wei Yenwu:
Yes, I am. It's been a while since I last saw Candela. It sounds like she hasn't changed. A crazed woman, as always.

Fumizuki:
You dare say you're not like her?

Wei Yenwu:
Of course I'm not like her.

Fumizuki:
From what the Messengers I sent there told me, Yühsia and our little Ch'en did really well.

Fumizuki:
I am not quite sure why the young lady of the Schwire family and Hoshiguma were there, however.

Wei Yenwu:
They did a wonderful job, indeed.

Wei Yenwu:
But my guess is they weren't very happy about it themselves.

Fumizuki:
Why not?

Wei Yenwu:
You said Candela wouldn't dare to hurt them. I agree.

Wei Yenwu:
But they are still too young to know how to endure her generosity.

Wei Yenwu:
That woman doesn't see right and wrong. Results are the only thing that matters.

Fumizuki:
So you're beating around the bush, trying to tell me I should never have sent the two of them there?

Wei Yenwu:
No, quite the opposite. You're right. There was no harm done in letting them see the sights there.

Fumizuki:
My, it's not often you say something so nice.

Fumizuki:
In that case, let me show you something nice as well.

Wei Yenwu:
What is it?

Fumizuki:
It's a photo that Yühsia brought back.

Wei Yenwu:
......

Fumizuki:
Look, isn't it wonderful? All of them are so young, so full of energy.

Fumizuki:
That used to be us. Do you remember?

Wei Yenwu:
Of course I remember.

Fumizuki:
I'll sleep better knowing Ch'en is doing well.

Fumizuki:
I'll frame this picture and cherish it forever.

Wei Yenwu:
As long as you're happy.

Fumizuki:
Yenwu.

Wei Yenwu:
Hm?

Fumizuki:
Is our little Ch'en going to come back?

Wei Yenwu:
Yes.

Fumizuki:
I'm glad.
