D.D.D.:
First, let's get a little music going!

D.D.D.:
Alright, you've been waiting for two days, and now we're on the brink of the championship's Round 2—the Triathlon!

D.D.D.:
The rules are simple as could be. First you run, then you ride, and finally you swim!

D.D.D.:
Obstructing competitors? No problem! As long as one of your teammates finishes, you pass!

D.D.D.:
Shortcuts are fair game, but careful of who's lying within the alleys! They're not gonna roll over and let you through!

D.D.D.:
Furthermore, if you reach the finish, but the cycling and swimming checkpoints never saw you, then that's not gonna count!

D.D.D.:
In other words, contestants, nothing's stopping you from spinning around and diving in at the start line—if you wanna be the laughing stock of the whole city.

D.D.D.:
If you're someone who's got it made and you wanna hitch on a low-altitude aircraft, sure!

D.D.D.:
But, if the audience doesn't like that, you might just get booted out at the votes!

D.D.D.:
Further, as fifteen teams directly passed Round 1, along with one team being revived thanks to audience voting, sixteen teams in total made it out.

D.D.D.:
Thus, eight teams will pass Round 2.

D.D.D.:
That's the first eight teams to make it who get the right to pass!

D.D.D.:
Well, then, let's invite those sixteen teams up onto the stage!

Eyjafjalla:
What a beautiful sea...

Sideroca:
It really is.

Sideroca:
Looks like we wasted nothing coming to this city.

Sideroca:
How about we sit down right here, then.

Eyjafjalla:
We could also head back. I'm worried we'll be a nuisance to the others here...

Sideroca:
Don't let it weigh on you. This city doesn't seem to mind the Infected too much.

Sideroca:
Though it's very plainly not because they're open-minded, but because they don't care...

Sideroca:
Besides, we have Sussurro with us. We'll be fine, right?

Sussurro:
Yes. I'm well aware of Eyjafjalla's condition.

Sussurro:
In my honest opinion, you should worry more about yourself than if you're troubling anyone else.

Sussurro:
You spend more time indoors than the average person, and that doesn't just have repercussions on your body, but your mental health as well.

Sussurro:
That's why I, as a doctor, endorsed bringing you here, Eyjafjalla.

Sussurro:
Everyone should have the right to enjoy the sunshine.

Sideroca:
Absolutely.

Sideroca:
They ran into some trouble, but I heard over the screen that the Doctor took a group on vacation somewhere.

Sideroca:
It's only right that Eyjafjalla and the rest of us get one too.

Eyjafjalla:
No, I came voluntarily to carry out geological research, and if I hold up everyone else...

Sideroca:
Aw, come on, now, don't you worry so much.

Sideroca:
We came here on legitimate grounds, too. Rhodes Island wants to set up a branch office here, and we've never been able to get the mayor's approval.

Sideroca:
Amiya's had us come here as a liaison.

Sideroca:
So you just relax and enjoy the competition.

Eyjafjalla:
Mhm. Thanks.

Sideroca:
Oh, right. Where's Projekt Red?

Sussurro:
I don't think she's coming here. She went off alone somewhere.

Sideroca:
Fine. She's been like this since forever. I'm used to it.

Sideroca:
Oh, look! They're up, they're up!

D.D.D.:
Let's welcome—LUNG wRATh!

Ch'en:
......

Lin Yühsia:
......

Ernesto:
Ahaha.

Lin Yühsia:
Maybe we should split up?

Ernesto:
The Triathlon's extremely long. We'll lose contact fast if we all do our own thing.

Ernesto:
Save for any teams sending lone people off to obstruct others, it's principally as a joint effort.

Ernesto:
If you two have no opinions along that line, then I suggest we work together.

Ch'en:
No objections.

Lin Yühsia:
That's acceptable. So long as you don't hinder me in a fight.

Ch'en:
And the very same to you.

Sideroca:
Who knew? I thought I was seeing things when I first saw her on the TV, but Ch'en really is here too.

Sideroca:
On her own vacation, I guess. After the competition's over, let's go say hello to her.

Eyjafjalla:
Okay.

Sideroca:
Brilliant. You two can watch, I'll go buy you some food. Stay right here and don't wander off, okay?

Sussurro:
Alright.

D.D.D.:
And that's your introduction to all sixteen teams.

D.D.D.:
Just like Round 1, you audience-siders get the chance to place your bets here and splash in even more competition joy.

D.D.D.:
All spectators are invited to register your info on the government site, and you can make yourself a little extra cash!

D.D.D.:
For specifics on how it'll work, refer to your government-issued competition guides.

D.D.D.:
During Round 2, you'll find our honored guest in a slightly different place.

D.D.D.:
Mr. Pancho's already headed for the cruise ship to prepare Round 3, so he'll be talking with you via video feed.

D.D.D.:
Alright, the contestants are all at the ready line! Let's have Lady Candela up for us to fire off the Round 2 salute!

Candela:
You have fun, all you youngsters. I declare—Round 2 has officially begun!

Ernesto:
It looks like we're being watched again.

Lin Yühsia:
Let's finish this quickly.
