Staff Worker:
Huh? What's wrong? I can't connect to the program's internal feed.

Staff Worker:
It's... being hijacked?

Pancho:
Ten years ago, I thought Bolívar would find true peace if we chased the Coalition and the Singas out of the country.

Pancho:
I risked my life to fight for True Bolívarians.

Pancho:
In the end, three thousand of my brothers fought to their deaths. If it wasn't for my own brother risking his life to save mine, I would've been shot that day.

Pancho:
And that was the day when I finally realized.

Pancho:
The Coalition, the Singas dynasty's nobles, and True Bolívarians. Not one of them truly wants to save Bolívar. All they are doing is fighting a war.

Pancho:
And no matter how long this war lasts, Bolívar will never see salvation.

Pancho:
To escape the turmoil, I made my way to this city.

Pancho:
In a hopeless country, I found this hopeless city.

Pancho:
And then we have Candela Sanchez, who's the most hopeless of us all.

Pancho:
On this hopeless swath of land, she built a city far more corrupt than all Bolívarian cities combined.

Pancho:
And not only is she enjoying this herself, she is even dragging all those around her into her cesspit of enjoyment.

Pancho:
All of them think they lead a proper life.

Pancho:
They have no idea just how much blood lies underneath them, in the city's sewers and how many scavenging beasts the place is feeding.

Pancho:
She is feeding on the flesh and blood of all those who live in these lands, never to care about their lives.

Pancho:
This city must die, and all of you who indulge in the pleasures this place has to offer must die with it!

Pancho:
The championship's over.

Pancho:
Now, I will take back this city.

Pancho:
If no one else will save this country, I will.

Ch'en:
........

Ch'en:
So your father is the one behind all this.

Ch'en:
When you realized we were starting to piece it all together, you chose to divert our attention toward you.

Ch'en:
That way, even if we actually figured it out, you would get to buy time for the one pulling the strings.

Ernesto:
That's right. I'm not going to say I won, Miss Ch'en. This was never a fair fight to begin with.

Ernesto:
You came too late, and you took on Ms. Candela's mission too hastily.

Ernesto:
This is the final bit of generosity I have to offer, Miss Ch'en. Surrender, along with Miss Lin.

Ernesto:
If you give up without a fight, I can guarantee that no one will lay a finger on you.

Ernesto:
You have nothing to do with this. There is no reason for you to jump into our morally gray mess.

Ch'en:
I can't do that.

Ernesto:
This ship has been taken over by our men. If you resist, you and Miss Lin will die.

Ch'en:
An old friend once told me, I have to take a beating before I can learn, like a young her, that being a stubborn ass is just a stupid impulse.

Ch'en:
And even now, I've got no idea what kind of stubbornness I'm supposed to stick to and what counts as an unrealistic, stupid impulse.

Ch'en:
But my guess is she probably knows that's not enough to stop me, or my name isn't Ch'en Hui-chieh.

Ch'en:
Do what you're gonna do. I'm in a hurry.

Startled Male Tourist:
Hey, isn't that Mr. Pancho? What is he talking about?

Startled Female Tourist:
I don't know. Is this some kind of special performance?

Terrified Male Tourist:
Was that an explosion?! Where was it?!

Terrified Female Tourist:
I think it came from the place where the first round took place! Look, there's smoke in that direction!

Terrified Male Tourist:
Hey, hey, hey! You're kidding! Is old man Pancho serious?!

Bodyguard:
Lady Candela, there are numerous unknown forces sowing chaos in the city and the surrounding countryside.

Candela:
Tsk tsk... So that's your move, Pancho?

Bodyguard:
Lady Candela, please, we need to move you somewhere safe.

Candela:
Evacuate? Don't be absurd. I have the front row seat here. I'm not going anywhere.

Candela:
Don't worry about the ruffians on the streets; deal with them as you see fit. My guess is that I am their ultimate objective anyway.

Candela:
Oh, don't forget to clear the crowds too. Be sure to close the city's gates first, though. Send everyone home.

Candela:
After that, secure the staff.

Candela:
However.

Candela:
Make sure they make preparations for the banquet, and definitely make sure the championship's live broadcast goes uninterrupted.

Candela:
Protect them, but don't ruin my championship. Is that understood?

Bodyguard:
Roger.

Candela:
Right, and get me some new drones. They probably wrecked all the ones on the ship. We mustn't miss out on all this fun.

Hoshiguma:
Hey, you're kidding. We're here on holiday. How did this happen?

Hoshiguma:
Though I guess this is what Bolívar is supposed to feel like.

Swire:
Enough. Let's figure out what to do with this.

Hoshiguma:
Missy, we're tourists. This is nothing we should poke our heads into.

Swire:
Would you say that to Ch'en Hui-chieh if she was standing right here?

Hoshiguma:
Of course, but I'm sure you know what she'd say.

Swire:
Then my answer's the same.

Hoshiguma:
Alright. All I'll say is I'm not against this.

Hoshiguma:
Rhodes Island... Ugh, Sideroca's getting drinks. Let me go check on her.

Swire:
And, besides, the two of them are on the ship too. How am I not supposed to worry?

Hoshiguma:
I'm not all that worried about them.

Hoshiguma:
What's more, we are outsiders. It's not like we've got a side here. Though with all this ruckus going on, I very much doubt Ch'en and Lin are oblivious.

Hoshiguma:
I don't know what's going on on the ship, and it's not very realistic for us to get on board to help them, so let's stick to the things we know we can do.

Tourist A?:
......

Tourist B?:
......

Sideroca:
Tsk, how dare you ambush me while I have drinks in my hands.

Sideroca:
(I didn't expect to see something like this happen here.)

Sideroca:
(Looks like they are organized. The beach has fallen into chaos.)

Sideroca:
(I don't have a weapon on me either, so it's hard for me to do anything. Maybe I should regroup with Hoshiguma first...)

Tourist A?:
Let's get her.

Tourist B?:
Alright.

Sideroca:
Gah!

Hoshiguma:
Sideroca!

Sideroca:
Thanks, Hoshiguma!

Hoshiguma:
No need to thank me. That reminds me, you're like the captain of this mission. You heard that just now, didn't you? What will Rhodes Island do about this?

Sideroca:
I'm on vacation myself. Just a passerby helping with what she can won't be a problem, right?

Hoshiguma:
Ha, I knew you would say that. Let's go, then.

Sideroca:
Oh, right.

Sideroca:
Red, where are you?

Projekt Red:
No idea, Sideroca. Lots of people. Stench of blood.

Sideroca:
Yeah, I know. Come to the beach.

Sideroca:
I need you to protect Eyjafjalla and Sussurro.

Projekt Red:
Okay.

Hoshiguma:
Hm?

Sideroca:
What's up?

Hoshiguma:
There's a group over there. They aren't running...

Sideroca:
Are they heading toward... the mayor?!

Hoshiguma:
Come, Sideroca, let's stop them!
