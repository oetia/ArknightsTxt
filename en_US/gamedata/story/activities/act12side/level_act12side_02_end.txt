D.D.D.:
They're insane, they're unstoppable! LUNG wRATh has beat back the three teams encircling them like it was any other day!

D.D.D.:
But the mystery is, what ability was our hero Lin using in that fight?

D.D.D.:
Director, run the replay!

Accompanied by only a brush of Lin Yühsia's hand on the window next to her, the glass gradually vanishes as if melting.

Straight after, a knife blade appears from her palm, almost colorless, only its reflection of the subtle sunshine rays proving its existence.

D.D.D.:
Here we can finally make it out—Lin has the incredible ability to turn glass into weapons! That's one to blow your mind!

D.D.D.:
We never imagined Lin was more than a martial master, who knew she had Originium Arts this brilliant to boot!

Hoshiguma:
Hey, Missy, what's with Miss Lin's power, though?

Swire:
Same as the Rat King's. She's actually manipulating sand, just in a different kind of way.

Swire:
She's been able to turn sand into glass since she was a kid. I'd always play with it.

Hoshiguma:
Ohh, I get it. Glass is made out of sand, for sure.

Hoshiguma:
Huh. I heard the Rat King could make sandstorms. Can Miss Lin do that?

Swire:
I don't know. My guess is she technically could, but wouldn't want to either.

Hoshiguma:
That figures. Miss Lin doesn't come off as the type to make a big scene.

D.D.D.:
Lin's Originium Arts are a total defense-breaker, to go with Ch'en's sharpshooting, and Mr. Ernesto's cover! What a perfect feast for the eyes!

D.D.D.:
Your thoughts, Mr. Pancho? Do you believe victory this time belongs to them?

Pancho:
Every member of the team is impressively strong, but their coordination's still half-baked.

D.D.D.:
Interesting to hear. It's true, competitions like this get competitors targeting you and taking you out if you throw too much personal power around.

D.D.D.:
History repeatedly testifies to us, only the united can clinch the final win!

Hoshiguma:
This old guy's got a keen eye. Spotted Ch'en and Lin's biggest issue straight away.

Swire:
I agree. Honestly, these two, and Ch'en especially. She knows at least what cooperation is from partnering with you, but she has no idea how Lin Yühsia fights, and her sword was her best weapon. She's doubly bound.

Swire:
And as for Lin Yühsia, that woman wouldn't know how to spell 'cooperation' if it walked up to her in big bold print.

Swire:
I saw her just short of gashing Ch'en several times, relying entirely on Ch'en to dodge her in time.

Swire:
I could die laughing. And the ones who don't know still think they work like two peas in a pod.

Swire:
That Ernesto's smart, I have to admit. He hasn't gotten anywhere near those two.

Swire:
It's the only good call. Not even nine lives would save you.

Hoshiguma:
Not bad, Missy. Observation powers have been getting better and better. I thought I'd have to explain it to you.

Swire:
I've been putting in the effort to take over Ch'en Hui-chieh's job, alright?

Hoshiguma:
I never doubted that one bit. Just didn't think you'd be making it so fast. Not bad at all.

Swire:
Stop sighing like you're the old guard above me. I'll dock your wages, that's a threat.

Hoshiguma:
Hey, don't you ever. You're a big person in big shoes. No point picking fights with a nobody like me.

Swire:
Hmph, that sounds more like it.

Hoshiguma:
Seriously, though, come to mention it. Watching them work together like this—it reminds me a little of when I first met Ch'en.

Swire:
She was the same back then?

Hoshiguma:
Nah, try flipping it around. She was pretty much like Miss Lin is now.

Hoshiguma:
If you had that old her and this Miss Lin team up, odds are they'd argue until they came to blows, ha ha.

Ch'en:
Your glass knives nearly cut me how many times?

Lin Yühsia:
Your water rounds weren't exactly true, either.

Ch'en:
Never mind emotionally. It seems we don't even make a good team tactically.

Lin Yühsia:
A very persuasive verdict. Let's split up.

Ernesto:
Hold on.

Ernesto:
How about this...?

Ernesto:
I know you two don't deal too well with each other, but seeing as you are, in fact, a team, at least try and act as much of a team as you can.

Ernesto:
As I mentioned before, you can't use comms during the competition, and you're not just looking for gold, either. You're investigating any possible terrorists, too.

Ernesto:
Sure, individually you two are hugely capable, but doesn't Yan have that saying—don't fear the certain, fear the unlikely?

Ernesto:
So my suggestion is, no matter if we have any pure gold or not, we meet back up here in one hour. Sound good?

Ernesto:
If one's a no-show, the other two play it by ear.

Ch'en:
No objections.

Lin Yühsia:
Acceptable.

Ernesto:
Phew, that's the most wavelength we'll get between you. Let's roll with that.

Lin Yühsia:
Then I'll be splitting off.

Ernesto:
She moves real fast...

Ernesto:
Miss Ch'en, do you plan on operating alone, or do you want me with you?

Ch'en:
You don't need to lose sleep over us. She and I aren't the type to throw everything else to the wind for a petty strop. We won't deny any truths from the other, and we will do what we must.

Ernesto:
Um... gonna be honest, here. No question about you two suiting each other, and splitting up is a really, really common tactic in Round 1 for sure.

Ernesto:
But, uh, there's only three of us. I don't think we need to all split up.

Ernesto:
So I'm gonna head with you.

Ch'en:
That works. Let's go.
