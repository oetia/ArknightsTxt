Czerny:
Though I sent the both of you off at the selections, things have changed. You two are now the primary candidates for Morgen und Abend.

Ebenholz:
Things have changed? What do you mean?

Czerny:
The two who were to perform Morgen und Abend cannot attend the concert now, which is why I had you two brought in.

Ebenholz:
Cannot attend... Did something happen with them?

Czerny:
They went to a tavern yesterday afternoon to eat and drink their fill.

Czerny:
Normal enough, but something piddling made those two clowns pick a fight.

Czerny:
So now, the flautist has a fractured arm, and worse still, the cellist somehow fell on his tailbone. He can't even sit, and there he is lying on his bed claiming he can play standing instead. Ridiculous!

Ebenholz:
What?

Czerny:
You seem shocked.

Ebenholz:
This is honestly... beyond expectation.

Czerny:
Is it?

Czerny:
It only took the second day of selections for this to happen, if I'm frank. If this was anything more than a chance bar fight, then you would be the greatest suspect.

Ebenholz:
Would I?

Ebenholz:
No—no, no, no, this has less than nothing to do with me.

Ebenholz:
My desire is to move you through music, not rough up the innocent.

Czerny:
Fine enough for you to say.

Czerny:
But you have the money to back Kreide. Paying to stir up trouble should be easy enough for you, shouldn't it?

Kreide:
Herr Czerny, I can testify Ebenholz never did anything like that.

Czerny:
You, testify? Did you glue your eyes to him for all of yesterday?

Kreide:
—I did.

Czerny:
And why did you do that?

Kreide:
I...

Ebenholz:
Of course he didn't 'glue his eyes to me,' the two of us were just together, discussing how to change your mind.

Ebenholz:
Though we never came to any conclusion in the end.

Czerny:
Kreide, is that the truth?

Kreide:
It is.

Czerny:
(Shakes head)

Czerny:
For the time being, in the moment being, I'll believe Kreide.

Kreide:
Thank you, Herr Czerny!

Ebenholz:
So...

Czerny:
Don't start parading.

Czerny:
All told, you're standing in. You're still some way from what I require.

Czerny:
Especially you, Ebenholz. You're the drag.

Czerny:
I'll give you the one day to rehearse. Come back to my home this evening, and I'll cast my eye.

Czerny:
You will only be chosen if you can meet my minimum standards. Otherwise, I would rather strike Morgen und Abend from the program. Understand?

Ebenholz:
Yes. You may rest assured.

Czerny:
Also, Kreide, weren't you missing a cello? Take this one with you.

Kreide:
Ca... Can I really?

Czerny:
Of course you can.

Czerny:
If you can meet my demands this evening, then this cello will be yours.

Kreide:
—Thank you, so, so much!

Czerny:
Alright, off you go. I need to sort out my own thoughts as is—

Czerny:
Is that Ursula? Did you forget your key again?

Voice Outside the Door:
Mr. Czerny, I'm an operator from Rhodes Island. You can call me Hibiscus.

Kreide:
Hibiscus! Oh, no, did something happen with my grandpa—

Hibiscus:
Hello, Mr. Czerny, it's nice to meet you.

Czerny:
Hello.

Czerny:
My talk with them is done. If you have business, feel free to take them away.

Kreide:
Hibiscus, is there anything new with my grandpa's condition?

Hibiscus:
Relax, it's okay. Your grandpa's gotten treatment already, and he's looking a lot more stable.

Hibiscus:
Mr. Czerny, it's not Kreide. I actually came here looking for you.

Czerny:
Me?

Hibiscus:
I'm hoping to get some insight into any change in your condition. Would right now be convenient for you?

Czerny:
What do you want me for?

Hibiscus:
There's been quite a few recent Infected cases of abnormal recovery around the Afterglow. I came here to investigate the whole phenomenon.

Hibiscus:
On top of that, you're a household name around here, so I was wondering if you had more of a handle on what's going on.

Czerny:
I'm sorry, but I've been just fine all along, and I can't say I know how anyone else is doing.

Hibiscus:
But aren't you holding a farewell concert? That usually—

Czerny:
I'm—sorry—but I need quiet. Can I ask you to leave, for now?

Czerny:
Who is it this time?

Voice Outside the Door:
Mein Herr, open her up. I forgot m'dang key.

Czerny:
......

Czerny:
Kreide, could you go out of your way to open the door again?

Kreide:
That's an awful lot you're carrying, Oma.

???:
Good boy, you go have a seat. I can carry it by m'self.

Kreide:
It's okay, I can bring this into the kitchen for you!

Ebenholz:
And this is...?

Czerny:
Ursula, distant relative of mine. She's cared for me, always.

Ursula:
Well, this is a rare sight, so many people at our home...

Ursula:
Bowl me over, you're a noble, aren't you? Oh, m'pologies!

Ebenholz:
Hardly. You can simply call me Ebenholz, if you so wish.

Ursula:
Oh, your Lordy sort better not joke around with old codgers like m'self.

Ebenholz:
It's no joke at all. You can just call me Ebenholz.

Ursula:
Honest?

Ebenholz:
Of course.

Ursula:
Then if you don't mind me, please.

Hibiscus:
Hello, Ms. Ursula!

Ursula:
Oof, what's this Sarka—

Ursula:
Bah, no! Slip of the tongue, Fräulein, I didn't mean that. Don't take it seriously, now!

Hibiscus:
It's okay, Ms. Ursula, I'm used to it.

Ursula:
Oh, no, no, I have to apologize... really, pardon me!

Ursula:
What do you need Mein Herr for? Concert matters again?

Hibiscus:
Not in particular. I wanted to ask if there was any change in Mr. Czerny's condition recently.

Ursula:
You a doctor?

Hibiscus:
I'm an operator from Rhodes Island. You can call me Hibiscus.

Ursula:
So you and Andante are coworkers?

Hibiscus:
Andante's a local operator. I'm here at Vyseheim on business from the landship.

Ursula:
That's a relief, then.

Ursula:
It's Andante who gives Mein Herr and me our medicine. Lots of folk get prescriptions from Rhodes Island, here in the Afterglow.

Ursula:
Mein Herr, how's the last few days...

Czerny:
Ahem.

Ursula:
Mein Herr, she's a doctor, now, a doctor who cares about your health. This is good for you.

Czerny:
I didn't ask her to come in!

Ursula:
Well, that's silly, now. If you didn't let her in, she wouldn't be in here.

Czerny:
......

Ursula:
Last year's when he started feeling unwell. No change when spring came this year. Wouldn't be wanting to do any farewell concert otherwise.

Ursula:
But since yesterday, he's been looking in much better spirits.

Hibiscus:
Is there anything else as well?

Ursula:
Let me think...

Czerny:
Ursula!

Ursula:
Alright, alright, m'lips are sealed.

Hibiscus:
Thank you so much for your help, Ms. Ursula.

Hibiscus:
If anything's the matter with Mr. Czerny, please give me a shout.

Ursula:
No need to tell us. We'd be asking Rhodes Island for a look if something happened, anyway.

Czerny:
Are you done? Are you happy?

Ursula:
All done—

Ursula:
—Oh, me and my memory! Said I'd make potato soup and forgot to even buy potatoes... I'll run back to the market now!

Hibiscus:
Mr. Czerny...

Czerny:
(Eyes practically full of fire)

Hibiscus:
—Ms. Ursula, I'll come with you! I have some questions about cooking I'd like to ask you!

Ebenholz:
Well, since everyone else has taken their leave, we should also...

Czerny:
Hold it.

Kreide:
Herr Czerny...

Czerny:
The key.

Kreide:
Oma Ursula, your key! Don't forget your key!

Ebenholz:
Huff, huff...

Ebenholz:
I never would've imagined an old lady could be so fast. I was a hair from losing her...

Ebenholz:
I owe it to you for helping me smooth things over back there.

Kreide:
That's alright, I trust in you. I know you wouldn't do something like that just to be selected.

Ebenholz:
......

Ebenholz:
So, we've handed the key over. Now we should be finding a place in the Afterglow to rehearse.

Kreide:
Can't we just perform right in the street, like everyone does?

Ebenholz:
We're rehearsing, not busking. These lanes are too noisy.

Kreide:
Oh.

Ebenholz:
How about your home? Your grandfather just so happens to have vacated, and it wears me to death traveling over from the Cliffy Patio every day.

Ebenholz:
Could I ask you to lay out a bed for me, and I stay at yours for the next while?

Kreide:
I'd welcome you, gladly, but my place is a wreck. I'm scared you wouldn't settle in.

Ebenholz:
I will, I will. Trust me.

Kreide:
This is my home.

Ebenholz:
Ergk...

Kreide:
What's the matter?

Ebenholz:
Is there something wrong...?

Ebenholz:
(The room's too small, there's a draft from the window, the timber is molding, there's practically no soundproofing...)

Ebenholz:
No, It's quite fine. Quite fine.

Ebenholz:
—Hold on, there's only a single bed here. Where does your grandpa sleep?

Kreide:
He sleeps in the bed. I sleep here on the floor.

Ebenholz:
But... isn't this just a rug?

Kreide:
For a rug, it's pretty nice, and I'm used to sleeping on it by now.

Kreide:
If you're going to live here, then I'll stay on the floor. It's no problem.

Ebenholz:
......

Ebenholz:
Let's just rehearse for now.

Ebenholz:
No good. I'm stuck at this mordent.

Kreide:
It's alright. We can start again from the last bar on the line above.

Ebenholz:
It's this mordent...

Kreide:
Should I slow down slightly at this part?

Ebenholz:
No need, it's only an ornament. I'm just being slightly hesitant.

Ebenholz:
—This again!

Kreide:
Ebenholz, I'll drop the tempo. Don't put an ornament at the end there, just play through like it's a single note.

Ebenholz:
The mark is printed on the score!

Kreide:
But you're straining your breath all the way in the bar before, just so you can brace for the mordent.

Ebenholz:
Fine.

Kreide:
Wonderful! We played it all the way through!

Ebenholz:
But I omitted that ornament, and Czerny will hear that, I'm sure of it.

Kreide:
It's alright, we still have time.

Ebenholz:
Easily said. With the state we're in now, you've no need for further rehearsal. I'm the only one who still has to spend time on this.

Kreide:
No, don't be like that. I have parts I'm not playing well myself.

Ebenholz:
Really?

Kreide:
Look, here. I didn't express these dynamics at all just now.

Ebenholz:
You're right.

Kreide:
And there's a few parts I've been barely forcing through. It's still too early to say I'm fluent.

Ebenholz:
You gave me a heart attack. I thought you'd already completely mastered this.

Kreide:
Haha. We've had so little time, and it's not like you could really be fluent in a single go. You have to take a lot of things nice and slow.

Ebenholz:
You're right.

Ebenholz:
Let's take a break for now, and then we'll work out all the kinks.

Gertrude:
O'er lofty Hills, the Fiend steps into Twilight's Midst agaze.

Gertrude:
The Blood hides Plague within, slow beckons Death to creep all Ways.

Gertrude:
Pestilence from Shadow wanton spouts, spews Ruin in Prelude.

Gertrude:
Fades Finale's Ensemble; Woe deprives of Sun's last Rays.

Gertrude:
What do you think of these edits?

???:
It's more or less the same as the previous edition. You're sure this prophecy will drive out the Rhodes Islander?

Gertrude:
A prophecy alone likely isn't enough, but if we add Their Majesties' names, then use it as a pretext to cause a tiny little uproar... the chance it'll succeed is great, and there won't be any real harm should it fail.

???:
Can you ensure the spread of this prophecy will be confined to the Afterglow?

Gertrude:
Please be assured. Previous small-scale disseminations of prophecies have not left any traces of their spread; moreover, as an Infected settlement—

???:
Then do it.
