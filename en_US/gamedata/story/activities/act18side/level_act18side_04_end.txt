Ebenholz:
(She's insane! Absolutely insane! That's an entire district of people we're talking about!)

Ebenholz:
(Besides, does she really think she can come away clean from an incident of this scale?)

Ebenholz:
(If I went along with her plan, I'd be the first one to take the fall!)

Ebenholz:
(Even though I'm losing this opportunity, there's nothing to feel bad about. I'll have other opportunities... I can afford to wait!)

Ebenholz:
(I made it... to Vyseheim's customs office...)

Just as Ebenholz is about to enter the customs office, an intense headache nearly knocks him off his feet.

Voice from Nowhere:
A coward on the run...

Ebenholz:
I don't need you telling me what to do!

Ebenholz:
Even if I die in Urtica, I don't want to become a murderer like you!

Voice from Nowhere:
You fear... You are afraid!

Voice from Nowhere:
If you are ensnared by fear... then never in your life shall you taste freedom!

Ebenholz:
Shut up!

Voice from Nowhere:
Naive idiot...

Ebenholz:
Call me whatever you want...

Voice from Nowhere:
Do you think that woman can get you out of here so easily?

Ebenholz:
?!

Ebenholz:
(Good, it doesn't look like there's anyone here...)

Ebenholz:
(I just need to be extra-careful and make sure nobody sees me...)

Ebenholz:
......

Ebenholz:
(Just a little farther, and I'll be in the uninhabited plate on the edge of the city...)

Ebenholz:
(Takes a deep breath)

Gertrude:
Were you seriously planning to jump off the edge of a nomadic city?

Ebenholz:
?!

Gertrude:
While that is technically the quickest way out of Vyseheim, I would advise against it.

Ebenholz:
Don't force my hand, Gertrude.

Gertrude:
I have no intention of doing that.

Ebenholz:
Then leave me alone, and get out of my sight.

Gertrude:
Where do you plan to go?

Gertrude:
Vyseheim will continue to move until the concert comes to an end. You have nowhere to go.

Gertrude:
Even if you risk life and limb to force your way out, only the barren wastelands await you.

Ebenholz:
I'd rather...

Ebenholz:
...step into the uncharted wastelands than...

Gertrude:
You'd rather die in the wastes than spend another second in Vyseheim?

Ebenholz:
Correct.

Gertrude:
I understand how you feel, but can you calm down first and let me finish?

Ebenholz:
What more do I need to hear from you?

Gertrude:
Do you really want me to reveal everything to you right here, my dear Graf Urtica?

Ebenholz:
Graf Urtica...

Ebenholz:
You don't need to emphasize my title. I know what you're trying to say.

Gertrude:
First of all, I promise that under the current conditions, our plan can still proceed smoothly.

Ebenholz:
It's not 'our' plan, it's yours.

Gertrude:
If your semantic games allow you to sleep better at night, then so be it.

Ebenholz:
Kreide's Voice of Mundane is damaged, and Rhodes Island has also discovered its side effect.

Ebenholz:
Can a damaged Voice of Mundane cancel out another one? Even if it could, would Rhodes Island turn a blind eye?

Gertrude:
Indeed, Kreide's Voice of Mundane can still join in Resonanz.

Gertrude:
As for Rhodes Island... Where do you think we are?

Gertrude:
This is Vyseheim. My domain.

Gertrude:
That little Fräulein Hibiscus is also an Infected. Even letting her step into Leithanien is only to keep up appearances with Rhodes Island. She can go nowhere but Vyseheim.

Gertrude:
In any case, she only knows that there's something going on with you and Kreide, but doesn't know how it's happening. She has no evidence.

Ebenholz:
......

Gertrude:
I understand, you don't have the heart to bring harm upon the Infected who have nothing to do with this.

Gertrude:
The way I see it, this compassion is extraneous. But if you truly wish to act upon it, it is even more important that you carry out the plan.

Ebenholz:
Carry out the plan, and let all those Infected people die?

Gertrude:
I'll tell you the rest of the plan then.

Gertrude:
You and Kreide will duet, and you will remove your own Voice of Mundane.

Gertrude:
Afterwards, I'll create some commotion in the concert hall, and take advantage of the chaos to kill Kreide and disguise his body as yours––

Ebenholz:
What did you say?!

Gertrude:
As he has become the biggest scourge of the Afterglow, it is impossible for him to live on.

Ebenholz:
Impossible for what? Don't be ridiculous! The biggest scourge of the Afterglow is none other than YOU!

Gertrude:
As I said before, all the scourges of the Afterglow come from Kreide's corrupted Voice of Mundane.

Gertrude:
Resonanz exacerbates the leakage of the Voice of Mundane, in an irreversible process.

Gertrude:
Even if you were to plummet off the edge of this nomadic city, Kreide's Voice of Mundane would not return to the relatively harmless state it was in a week ago.

Gertrude:
More importantly, the Voice of Mundane isn't just harming the people around Kreide, it's also hurting him.

Gertrude:
He is the biggest victim of the Resonanz between you two.

Gertrude:
He may seem perfectly healthy right now, but don't be fooled. That is just another example of false recovery.

Gertrude:
Kreide's body may have adapted to the Voice of Mundane in the past, but with the recent surge of leakage, this delicate balance is about to be thrown upside down.

Gertrude:
An optimistic estimate is that his good days will come to an end within two weeks. After that, he will experience the intense suffering that occurs in the acute phase following the false recovery phase.

Gertrude:
The happiest ending for both him and the Afterglow, would be for him to die following the concert.

Gertrude:
For you, for me, for the Afterglow, and for him. It would be a good thing.

Gertrude:
I would obtain a trump card I could pull out at any time. The Afterglow would obtain peace, Kreide would obtain his rest.

Gertrude:
And you... you would obtain your freedom.

Gertrude:
Graf Urtica, rightful heir to Leithanien...

Gertrude:
The last of the Witch King's bloodline.

Freedom.

For as long as I can remember, I've never known freedom.

???:
Poor child.

???:
No courtesy or greetings are needed. Just listen to me.

???:
Even though you were born into a distant branch far from the Witch King, you are indeed the last of his bloodline.

???:
Out of pity, I will not trouble you.

???:
Beyond that, you shall also inherit the fiefs passed down from generation to generation in your family.

???:
You will become the Lehnsherr of Urtica.

???:
You will learn to take responsibility for your own subjects.

???:
You are about to take a completely different path from that of your disgraceful kin––

???:
I await you.

This was my first memory.

I was around five or six years old at the time, I can't remember from before that. I only vaguely remember coming into contact with a strange thing called the 'Voice of Mundane,' and nearly lost my life.

Staring at the pure-white dress in front of me, I was filled with thoughts that I'd become some obscure little aristocrat.

I thought I'd live the rest of my life in peace, with the exception of the occasional headache and the auditory hallucinations from the Voice of Mundane.

Stoic-Looking Noble:
Your Illustrious Highness, you should know to mind your words and actions, and to not leave the Spire without good reason.

Stoic-Looking Noble:
I must remind you, everything that you are has been bestowed upon you by Their Majesties.

Cautious Servant:
Your Illustrious Highness, aren't you forgetting something?

Cautious Servant:
You ought to praise Their Majesties before you eat.

Rule-Abiding Instructor:
Your Illustrious Highness, we will be learning a new piece today.

Rule-Abiding Instructor:
This song expresses the gratitude of the nobles towards Their Majesties. Please keep that in your heart.

Mediocre Caster:
Your Illustrious Highness, your mastery over Originium Arts is simply transcendent!

Mediocre Caster:
Hm, you want something more elaborate? Haha, you need not wear yourself out.

Everyone around me did everything they could to limit my freedom, instilling in my mind an allegiance to the Twin Empresses.

If that was the price for being able to live in peace and quiet, I was willing to pay it.

I paid it for a very long time.

Stoic-Looking Noble:
Your Illustrious Highness, I shall be frank from the onset. You are the true heir to Leithanien.

Stoic-Looking Noble:
I've been laying in wait in your spire for a number of years now. I'm sure you recognize me.

Stoic-Looking Noble:
You don't have to say anything. Just listen to me. You don't have to agree with me or repudiate me.

Stoic-Looking Noble:
I know that you're scared, that you don't want to lose even this life you have now. But you should at least know how those people see you, and what they want you to do.

Stoic-Looking Noble:
I'm sure you know that the attendants the tyrants have forced upon you are setting up the banquet below. I will take you there, and let you see the truth.

The one in front of me grabbed me and pulled me up off the ground.

My palm was drenched in sweat.

Uproarious Voice:
Now that's the good stuff!

Uproarious Voice:
I had no idea you had such exquisite wine down in the cellar.

Familiar Voice:
You flatter me.

Familiar Voice:
Urtica's countryside lacks just about everything, but there are indeed a number of master winemakers here.

Uproarious Voice:
Then we've got to make sure to drink our fill before the little runt grows up. Can't be leaving any for him!

Familiar Voice:
Haha, that simply won't do.

Familiar Voice:
The boy has been under house arrest for a number of years, but I'm looking for the right time to teach him how to drink. I'll have to fill him until he's a hopeless alcoholic.

I was entranced for a short while.

Uproarious Voice:
Oh, so you still had that trick up your sleeves.

Uproarious Voice:
Once the runt has been completely soaked with wine, it'll be a load off Their Majesties'––

Familiar Voice:
Shh!

Uproarious Voice:
Yes, yes, right. Screw me, mate! Guess I'll have to repent with another glass!

Familiar Voice:
But remember, these words don't leave the wine table.

Familiar Voice:
We can't allow the boy to have heirs. That's the order from on high, with my life on the line.

Uproarious Voice:
If it's that big of a deal, why don't you find an apothecary...

Familiar Voice:
That won't work, it'd leave a paper trail. Only by letting him usher his own downfall will my task be considered complete.

Uproarious Voice:
Ambitious! Truly ambitious! Come, let us drink to that!

Familiar Voice:
If I can get rid of the boy without getting my hands dirty, then Urtica will be mine.

Uproarious Voice:
I'll drink to that! Prost!

Familiar Voice:
Prost!

Voice from Nowhere:
Haha, hahahahaha....

Voice from Nowhere:
Did you hear that, boy?

Voice from Nowhere:
This is the peaceful, easygoing life you wanted!

Gertrude:
Herr Ebenholz, Herr Ebenholz?

Ebenholz:
......

Gertrude:
You fell over on the spot. I almost had you sent to the hospital.

Gertrude:
Feeling a little better?

Ebenholz:
I...

Ebenholz:
I'm perfectly fine.

Gertrude:
About the plan...

Ebenholz:
I don't want to hear it right now.

Ebenholz:
I'm going.

Gertrude:
As I said, you can leave at any time.

Ebenholz:
Don't come pestering me again.

Gertrude:
Well, you'll have to forgive me for being bad at following orders.

Ebenholz:
......

Kreide:
Welcome back–– Your complexion looks terrible. What's wrong, did you get sick?

Ebenholz:
I'm fine.

Kreide:
You sure don't look fine to me. Go rest in bed and I'll boil some water for you.

Ebenholz:
There's no need.

Kreide:
Relax. I used to take care of Grandpa when he first got sick. Just lie down and let me handle the rest.

Kreide:
If you don't get any better, I'm going to tell Hibiscus.

Kreide:
I'll be right back!

Graf Urtica endures a splitting headache and lies there in bed.

His consciousness gradually blurs.

Voice from Nowhere:
Depraved maggots.

Ebenholz:
?!

Voice from Nowhere:
They would destroy your exalted bloodline...

Ebenholz:
Shut up...

Ebenholz:
Argh!

Voice from Nowhere:
Self-deprecating trash!

Ebenholz:
......

The sound of a cello comes from afar.

His headache is no less intense, but the voice in Graf Urtica's head is drowned out by the melody from the cello.

A wave of reprieve washes over him.

This melody sounds somewhat familiar.

His splitting headache makes it impossible for him to gather his thoughts, but he feels he has heard this melody somewhere before.

Where have I heard this before...

Where?

Ebenholz:
......

Kreide:
You're awake!

Ebenholz:
I...

Kreide:
Just stay put for now. Hibiscus just came over and drew blood when she saw the state you were in. She said there's nothing wrong with your body, but you might be over-stressed and worn out.

Ebenholz:
(Over-stressed... Hah...)

Ebenholz:
I heard someone playing the cello just now... Was that you?

Kreide:
Yes.

Ebenholz:
Where... did you learn that melody?

Kreide:
Hmm, maybe someone hummed it to me when I was little?

Kreide:
I don't exactly remember.

Ebenholz:
When you were little...

Ebenholz:
When you were little––

Ebenholz:
!!!

Ebenholz:
You–– You're that––

Kreide:
I'm what?

The weakened Graf Urtica struggles a few times, but nevertheless is unable to crawl out of bed.

But those dusty memories within his mind, awakened by the sound of the cello, flashed once more before his eyes.
