Kreide:
I'm so sorry I'm late...

Ebenholz:
This is the selections! If you were tardier by twenty minutes, we'd be hand in hand as we waltzed home!

Kreide:
I'm sorry...

Ebenholz:
Would you mind quickly explaining yourself?

Kreide:
My... grandpa went missing this morning, actually.

Ebenholz:
Missing?

Kreide:
Nothing terribly serious. I found him in the Afterglow in an alley, and he said he was just up too early, out for a walk.

Ebenholz:
For a walk, the whole time until you arrived here?

Kreide:
No, no, I went to Rhodes Island this morning too, for the admission procedures.

Ebenholz:
With your grandfather? At the Rhodes Island office?

Ebenholz:
I recall Rhodes Island having only a miniscule branch in Vyseheim. They couldn't be admitting patients.

Kreide:
They couldn't, but Hibiscus gave up her own bed, and she promised she'd put my grandpa's health first.

Ebenholz:
Hmph... A charming tale, but that cost you a pretty penny, didn't it?

Kreide:
They took the money this morning. It was less than half of what you gave me yesterday.

Ebenholz:
Well, well. You'll have to check regularly on your grandpa, then, so they don't trim corners where you're not looking.

Kreide:
'Trim corners?'

Ebenholz:
They're a business, after all. Their profits have to come from the sick, if they admit them on such low fees. Say, a little from their meals, a little from their equipment and medication—

Kreide:
I don't think that's what's happening.

Ebenholz:
And how do you know?

Kreide:
Yesterday afternoon, they gave him medicine to take before I'd paid anything.

Kreide:
And Hibiscus spared some food for me this morning. I only turned her down because I was so short on time.

Ebenholz:
Such a meticulous performance. Surely your grandpa was unwilling to go precisely because he could see that.

Kreide:
I get it. I'll be checking in on him as much as I can.

Kreide:
Thank you.

Ebenholz:
Thank me?

Kreide:
I know you're taking pains to tell me all this because you're worried me or my grandfather will be hurt.

Ebenholz:
......

Ebenholz:
Never mind. Let's move on.

Ebenholz:
What did you think of the score after picking it up last night?

Kreide:
I—

Mannered Infected:
Next entry, Ebenholz and Kreide!

Ebenholz:
Come.

Ebenholz:
Czerny is overseeing the selections today in person. We can't afford to embarrass ourselves.

Ebenholz:
Greetings, Herr Czerny.

Czerny:
No need for pleasantries. Go on, begin.

The selections are quite unlike the applications, where crowds thronged the seats to watch. Save for a scant few staff, only Czerny and the entrants are present.

If yesterday's audience was present, the majority would be applauding this brief ensemble piece until their hands were raw.

But here and now, as the final lingering notes fall away, the look on Czerny's face is fearsome.

Ebenholz:
Herr Czerny?

Czerny:
You haven't practiced much, have you?

Ebenholz:
As you surmised, but—

Czerny:
It smacks too strongly of being scrabbled together, you on your flute and him on his cello. There's almost no sense of coordination.

Czerny:
Especially from you. You were stuck fast to your own tempo, completely ignoring what the cello emoted during his melodic passage. Conversely, you forced him to accommodate for you instead.

Czerny:
If you hadn't realized in time, you would have ruined the entire passage.

Ebenholz:
I would have ruined the entire passage?

Ebenholz:
No, I feel you may not have heard quite clearly...

Czerny:
I'm sat right here, and you tell me I don't hear clearly? You think something's wrong with my hearing?

Kreide:
Herr Czerny, Ebenholz doesn't mean to offend you, he just...

Czerny:
Just what? All I see is someone too coddled by flattery.

Ebenholz:
Coddled by flattery?! You know nothing of my circumstances, I ask you to rescind—

Kreide:
(Hisses) Ebenholz!

Ebenholz:
......

Czerny:
I will consider Kreide. You may leave. Next.

Ebenholz:
What did you say? Do you imply even he—

Kreide:
—Herr Czerny.

Czerny:
Hm?

Kreide:
If Ebenholz isn't allowed to perform, then I can't be in this concert either.

Czerny:
What's forcing you to speak for him?

Kreide:
Ebenholz has been a huge help to me, so...

Czerny:
I'm sorry, but this concert won't sink for losing one potential cellist, and losing one pot-stirrer of a Lord will pain me even less.

Czerny:
Next!

Ebenholz:
Scoundrel! Who does he think he is? So flippant just because he's played a piano, written a piece or two?!

Kreide:
Calm down, come on.

Ebenholz:
How am I meant to be calm? What kind of attitude was that? 'Coddled by flattery?' I'm a fine, upstanding man. Who's ever coddled me? Give me a name!

Kreide:
I think there was just a small misunderstanding between you. Surely Herr Czerny didn't think we were that lousy...

Ebenholz:
Of course you weren't lousy, that was me! Did you forget what he said? 'I will consider Kreide. You may leave!'

Kreide:
I think the sooner you apologize to him, the better. He might just let us try again.

Ebenholz:
There's always some way, and it doesn't have to include humbling myself so badly before him!

Kreide:
But... I can't think of anything that'd help other than an apology...

Ebenholz:
(Takes a deep breath)

Ebenholz:
You return home, in any case. I'll be returning to my residence to contemplate what to do.

Ebenholz:
If there really is no alternative, then we'll seek out Czerny.

Kreide:
Well... alright, then.

Ebenholz:
'Coddled by flattery'...

Ebenholz:
This musician knows nothing, and he dares prattle...

Ebenholz:
Tch!

Ebenholz:
(There's the headache again...)

Voice from Nowhere:
Useless fake...

Ebenholz:
!

Voice from Nowhere:
Even the lowly blight-wracked commoners loathe the vulgar sound of your flute...

Ebenholz:
You shut up right now!

Ebenholz:
......

Fretful Noble:
Mein Herr, we may not be acquainted, but you seem to be in need of some help?

Ebenholz:
Not at all... I appreciate the trouble.

Fretful Noble:
Erm...

Fretful Noble:
(He really is hers—)

Fretful Noble:
Pardon my insolence.

Ebenholz:
Oh, so it's you. Do you feel unwell?

Fretful Noble:
Er? You—what did you say? No, not at all.

Ebenholz:
Really? Your face looks somewhat sickly to me.

Fretful Noble:
Of course not, haha, hahahaha...

Fretful Noble:
Pardon me, pardon me...

Gertrude:
Your headaches are flaring up again?

Ebenholz:
It's fine. It's more or less faded by now.

Gertrude:
I'm sorry.

Ebenholz:
What are you apologizing to me for?

Gertrude:
I was so inconsiderate as to cause you embarrassment at the selections today, and give you a headache at that.

Ebenholz:
You were so inconsiderate?

Gertrude:
Indeed. For better or worse, I am one of the sponsors of this concert, and news about it reaches me fast, Herr Ebenholz.

Ebenholz:
......

Gertrude:
You needn't worry. This is nothing major.

Gertrude:
In fact, I hear Czerny didn't assess you two badly at all. He intentionally designated you as backups for 'Morgen und Abend.'

Ebenholz:
Really?

Gertrude:
We are more or less friends. I have him worked out to an extent.

Gertrude:
He's a famed artist, after all, come rain or shine, and Infected too. His temper flared up. Please, excuse him.

Ebenholz:
Hmph.

Gertrude:
I do have my influence over this concert. You and Kreide can practice; I'll do Czerny's work.

Ebenholz:
I'd rather redo the selections than have you exercise your sway, to be honest. This morning was merely an aberration in performance.

Gertrude:
Of course, of course.

Gertrude:
Still, you needn't let this perturb you so badly.

Gertrude:
Tea? We have a citrus-flavored black tea today. They say it does good things for headaches.

Ebenholz:
Thank you very much.

Gertrude:
How is it?

Ebenholz:
Fragrant. I appreciate the hospitality.

Gertrude:
Well, then, moving on. Listen closely, please.

Gertrude:
As you'd anticipated, my inviting you to Vyseheim, for a concert in the Infected settlement, does come with ulterior motives.

Ebenholz:
......

Gertrude:
You don't seem too bowled over.

Ebenholz:
I'm used to being exploited by now.

Ebenholz:
It would've surprised me more if you had no other motive.

Gertrude:
In that case, I'll be straightforward.

Gertrude:
I have a plan that's been a long time ready.

Gertrude:
If you act according to this plan, I have great certainty I can free you from the 'Voice of the Mundane.'

Ebenholz:
—What did you say?!

Gertrude:
The Voice of the Mundane, Herr Ebenholz. The root of your many misfortunes, one of the legal grounds on which you possess Grafschaft of Urtica, the—

Ebenholz:
I don't need you to explain what the Voice of the Mundane is. The thing has been inside my head all this time, tormenting me when it sees fit.

Ebenholz:
What I need you to expound on is the details of this plan.

Gertrude:
It's very simple. Just perform at Herr Czerny's concert as an ensemble with your fresh acquaintance Herr Kreide, and that will suffice.

Ebenholz:
......

Ebenholz:
Out of sheerest kindness, I'll treat this as a poor joke, Dame Gertrude.

Gertrude:
This is in no way a joke.

Gertrude:
Just like you, Kreide harbors the Voice of the Mundane within him.

Ebenholz:
Him? The Voice of the Mundane?

Ebenholz:
The Twin Empresses made it explicit that I was the only one left who carried it!

Gertrude:
That merely shows there are things even they don't know. To boot, it isn't even that rare.

Ebenholz:
......

Gertrude:
Two Voices of the Mundane need only come close enough in space in order for 'Resonanz' to occur, and this sonority will amplify both your Arts as it occurs. That is the basis of my plan.

Gertrude:
Beyond amplifying your Arts, Resonanz is its own kind of powerful energy, and *this* energy will be massively intensified when you two perform in ensemble.

Gertrude:
It just needs the appropriate induction, and I'll be able to make use of this energy to transfer your Voice of the Mundane into him.

Ebenholz:
Then what will happen to Kreide?

Gertrude:
Fear not. I'll handle that as deemed fit.

Ebenholz:
I still don't understand, though. Why does it have to be Czerny's concert?

Ebenholz:
I'll duet with Kreide at his home, you come induce this resonance, and you transfer my Voice of the Mundane into him. Won't that work?

Gertrude:
The induction of Resonanz is a delicate art. Alone without the Afterglow Hall, I wouldn't be able to do it.

Ebenholz:
The Afterglow Hall?

Gertrude:
Didn't you know? Construction of the Afterglow Hall was completed under the Witch King's supervision.

Ebenholz:
I never heard.

Gertrude:
Being a building he ordered in the twilight of his reign, the materials and architecture employed in the Hall share many resemblances to his Spire.

Gertrude:
It wasn't meant as the concert hall it is, synonymous with the Infected district. It was meant as a fortress of Arts, a nightmare to terrify His Majesty's enemies.

Gertrude:
I've overstepped my bounds in doing so, but I do require the Afterglow Hall aid me in conducting the Resonanz's energy, so we can ultimately eliminate the Voice of Mundane that dwells in your body.

Gertrude:
Do you have any other questions about the detail of this plan?

Ebenholz:
......

Gertrude:
After it's done, I will handle Kreide and any other remaining trifles. You need only hide for a suitable length of time.

Gertrude:
Once it all blows over, you can escape your unbearable nobility once and for all, and become a free civilian.

Gertrude:
Of course, if you aren't alright accepting such ready freedom, I won't force you, and I certainly won't make an enemy of you on the grounds that you know my plan.

Gertrude:
Whether you wish to remain in Vyseheim until the concert concludes, or return immediately to Urtica, I will not stop you.

Ebenholz:
You won't stop me...

Ebenholz:
You're the first to want to rid me of the Voice of Mundane, rather than exploit it.

Ebenholz:
Just what are you hoping to gain from me?

Gertrude:
A powerful assistance.

Ebenholz:
A what?

Ebenholz:
I'm just a puppet Graf. I can't even manage my own fiefs personally.

Ebenholz:
After your supposed plan succeeds, I'll be no more than an unidentified civilian. What powerful assistance?

Gertrude:
Fiefs, armies, even Originium Arts... none of that is important.

Gertrude:
What's important is the Graf Urtica gone missing, even declared dead.

Gertrude:
Think of it. How will the Leithanian public opinion respond when at the right juncture, the Graf Urtica returns from the grave?

Gertrude:
To 'return from the grave.' That's the greatest aid you could ever lend me.

Ebenholz:
I understand.

Ebenholz:
Please... allow me some time alone, Dame Gertrude.

Gertrude:
I'd be glad to.

Gertrude:
If you wish to travel anywhere, don't hesitate to tell the servants outside.

Ebenholz:
Farewell.

Gertrude:
Farewell. May your decision be the one that suits your interests.

Gertrude:
Hello.

???:
Listen. You must watch whatever happens between Kreide and Rhodes Island closely.

???:
You may disrupt Rhodes Island's movements when necessary, but remember never to alert them at any cost. Direct military conflict is forbidden.

Gertrude:
Understood.

Gertrude:
Allow me to report to you on Graf Urtica's circumstances...

???:
You can save it. We know.

???:
This is your plan. If you feel the need to expound on minor matters like this, we'll simply send someone to put you back on track.

Gertrude:
Apologies, I was not considerate.

Gertrude:
Ebenholz will be easy enough, but Kreide and Rhodes Island...

Gertrude:
......

Gertrude:
I'd forgot. I have what I need, ready and waiting.
