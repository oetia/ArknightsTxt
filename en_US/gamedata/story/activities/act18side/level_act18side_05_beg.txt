Kreide:
How do you feel? All better now, right?

Ebenholz:
I'm fine...

Ebenholz:
I'm totally fine, I'm sure of it. The both of us are.

Ebenholz:
I'm going out for a bit, so stay put here.

Kreide:
You're going out again the moment you feel a little better?

Ebenholz:
I've got work to do.

Kreide:
That's fine and all, but shouldn't you at least wait until you've recovered?

Ebenholz:
Don't worry about me.

Kreide:
Hibiscus said the same thing. After you wake up, it'd be best to keep resting for a while and monitoring your condition.

Ebenholz:
It's an emergency, one that can't wait. Alright?

Kreide:
But, there's not a whole lot of time left until the concert. I think the most important to do until then is to make sure you're healthy and well-practiced... I'm sure that's what you want too.

Ebenholz:
Can you stop pestering me with that right now?

Kreide:
Pestering?

Ebenholz:
That's not what I meant.

Ebenholz:
But I have to go, so don't get in my way. I'll be back as soon as I can.

Kreide:
And you really... can't tell me what you're going to do?

Ebenholz:
If everything goes well... you'll know soon enough.

Ebenholz:
Oh right, your suit.

Kreide:
What about it?

Ebenholz:
I made an appointment to pick it up this afternoon, but I won't be able to go with you. You should go get it yourself.

Ebenholz:
Remember to bring your cello with you and play a little passage as you're trying it on. Make sure there aren't any areas that feel uncomfortable.

Ebenholz:
I'll be back.

Czerny:
You again?

Hibiscus:
Yes, it's me.

Hibiscus:
I'm here to ask you to put this concert on hold. Or at least, don't let Ebenholz and Kreide play together.

Czerny:
What did you say?

Hibiscus:
Something terrible is going to happen in the Afterglow if those two play together!

Czerny:
So if what you're saying is true, my recent improvement was due to this so-called 'false recovery' caused by Ebenholz and Kreide. And as soon as this phase is over, I'll become critically ill and my life will be in danger.

Hibiscus:
That's right. You've been around them a lot, so the symptoms will also be a lot more pronounced.

Czerny:
Others who've had less contact with them are also affected, and if I let the two of them play together, there's a high possibility that people will die?

Hibiscus:
Correct. Even though I don't know the exact reason, having the two play together seems to amplify the effect they have on their surroundings.

Czerny:
How likely are we talking about here?

Hibiscus:
I can't say for sure right now...

Czerny:
Other than me, who else is in life-threatening danger?

Hibiscus:
Over a dozen people from the Afterglow have already been hospitalized in the Cliffy Patio.

Czerny:
The Cliffy Patio... In other words, they've already left Ebenholz and Kreide's effective range?

Hibiscus:
That should be the case.

Czerny:
Then I have a clear picture of the situation.

Hibiscus:
Your answer...

Czerny:
...is no.

Hibiscus:
What?!

Hibiscus:
I'm not asking you to cancel the whole concert. You can just cut Ebenholz and Kreide's part, or even have someone else perform the duet!

Czerny:
If you can prove that their duet will cause harm to people other than me, then I'll cancel the concert right away.

Czerny:
But it seems that's not the case. Even you have no idea what would happen if they played together. I can't simply throw away the efforts and aspirations of everyone in the Afterglow over these illusory 'concerns.'

Hibiscus:
The efforts and aspirations...?

Hibiscus:
I understand how much this concert means to you, but...

Czerny:
You don't understand anything.

Czerny:
If you truly understood, you wouldn't throw around the word 'but' so lightly.

Czerny:
Unfortunately, I cannot change the concert schedule on your word alone.

Hibiscus:
Mr. Czerny, please give me a straight answer. What makes this concert more important than the lives of the Infected?

Czerny:
What are you talking about?

Czerny:
Are you suggesting that I'm disregarding peoples' lives?

Hibiscus:
I'm just saying––

Ursula:
Hibiscus! Hibiscus!

Hibiscus:
Ms. Ursula?

Ursula:
Come take a little stroll, won't you?

Hibiscus:
But—

Ursula:
Come now.

Ursula:
Let's head out and calm down first. We can talk about this later, okay?

Ebenholz:
(If everything Gertrude said is true, then Kreide won't survive this.)

Ebenholz:
(No, there must be some way... Some way to come out ahead on both fronts...)

Ebenholz:
(Czerny, Czerny must know something...)

Ebenholz:
(No, he's just a musician, he won't be able to help.)

Ebenholz:
(Should I tell Kreide the truth––)

Ebenholz:
(But what good would that do?)

Ebenholz:
(Rhodes Island...)

Ebenholz:
(Someone like Hibiscus is only going to send me back to my cell in Urtica!)

Ebenholz:
(The Empresses' Voice?)

Ebenholz:
(What am I even thinking? Is this a suicide mission?!)

Ebenholz:
(No, I've been going in circles. I'm standing out too much. I need to go somewhere less crowded.)

Ebenholz:
(Huh? Have I seen that man before?)

Frivolous Noble:
Be careful.

Suspicious Infected:
Definitely... the crowd.

Ebenholz:
(Right, the rumor. There was that rumor!)

Ebenholz:
(I've got to get to the bottom of this rumor. Who knows, there might even be some clues, or the person spreading the rumor might know something!)

Ebenholz:
(But it's all up to me at this point...)

Frivolous Noble:
You sure?

Suspicious Infected:
This is the best opportunity we're going to get.

Suspicious Infected:
The longer things drag on, the less time we'll have. It'll only make things harder.

Frivolous Noble:
Alright, hurry it up then. I'll go report to the higher-ups. I'm counting on you, Herr Lachmann.

Lachmann:
Heh. This work sure is demanding, physically and emotionally.

Lachmann:
It's hard enough spreading the rumors. Now I even have to go THERE...

Ebenholz:
(The sewers? He's heading into the sewers?)

Ebenholz:
(I'd rather not have to follow him down there... Time to act.)

Ebenholz:
Hold it right there.

Lachmann:
Who are you?!

Ebenholz:
Don't turn around.

Ebenholz:
Tell me, who sent you to spread rumors in the Afterglow?

Lachmann:
You've got the wrong idea, I just happened to overhear...

Ebenholz:
I've been following you the whole time, Herr Lachmann.

Ebenholz:
And I connected the dots just now. You were one fanning the flames before, spreading rumors to have that mob accost Hibiscus.

Lachmann:
You've got a pretty good memory.

Ebenholz:
Speak. Who sent you here, and what were you planning to do in the sewers?

???:
What wonderful timing. I am also quite curious as to what Herr Lachmann planned to do in the sewers.

Ebenholz:
?!

???:
Don't turn around, or else...

???:
What do you think will happen?
