Ebenholz:
Let me see... That's right, this is the place.

Kreide:
Isn't this place too ornate to be a music store?

Ebenholz:
Of course – this is the best music store in all of Vyseheim. Otherwise, I wouldn't have brought you here.

Kreide:
But, I didn't apply to enter the Cliffy Patio.

Ebenholz:
Those bureaucrats are so inefficient that by the time they process your application, the concert would already be over.

Ebenholz:
Plus, even if we do get found out, we'd only be looking at a fine.

Kreide:
I heard that if someone helps an Infected leave the Afterglow, the punishment for them is worse than for the Infected.

Ebenholz:
What's there to be afraid of? It'll be fine.

Ebenholz:
Stand up straight and don't act skittish. Just don't let anyone be able to tell and we won't have any issues––

Inexperienced Clerk:
Welcome, Mein Herr. Are you here to pick out an instrument, or...?

Ebenholz:
Of course. Let's find ourselves a cello first.

Inexperienced Clerk:
Very well.

Inexperienced Clerk:
Who might this gentleman with you be?

Ebenholz:
Him? He's my...

Inexperienced Clerk:
Mein Herr, I apologize for my rudeness, but I must remind you that those wearing unauthorized apparel are not allowed into the store.

Kreide:
I'll go wait outside then.

Inexperienced Clerk:
Outside? What exactly are you afraid of, acting all suspicious? Don't tell me you––

Ebenholz:
Do you have any idea upon whom you're casting aspersions? Unauthorized? Suspicious? How dare you use such words to describe a noble! Do you value your job or not?

Ebenholz:
He's simply fallen on hard times, and has no choice but to dress plainly. His clothes are neither damaged nor dirty, so why would he not be allowed inside the store?

Inexperienced Clerk:
Excuse my rudeness, but this gentleman's attire does not match the store's required style of...

Ebenholz:
Style?

Ebenholz:
My–– cousin, has just suffered a great upheaval. His cello, which he cherished greatly, was destroyed in the turmoil.

Ebenholz:
I wanted to bring him here to buy a new cello as a way of expressing my condolences. What right do you have to spout nonsense about 'style?'

Inexperienced Clerk:
I am terribly sorry about this, but it is store policy that all customers must be dressed appropriately.

Inexperienced Clerk:
I'm sorry, but I cannot allow your companion to enter.

Ebenholz:
Fine then!

Ebenholz takes off his cloak and drapes it over Kreide.

Ebenholz:
Now that he's wearing the same clothes as me, can he enter? Or, is my cloak somehow part of your inappropriate dress?

Ebenholz:
If I put my cloak back on later, am I also not allowed to enter?

Inexperienced Clerk:
Well...

Inexperienced Clerk:
I... I'll go ask the manager.

Ebenholz:
This one can't just mind his own business!

Kreide:
Here, your coat...

Kreide:
Thank you.

Ebenholz:
You're welcome.

Ebenholz:
It was my idea to bring you here to buy a cello in the first place.

Ebenholz:
I'm bringing you inside the store one way or another, even if I have to pick a fight with that clerk.

Inexperienced Clerk:
We would like to extend our sincerest apologies to both of you.

Inexperienced Clerk:
The manager will be here shortly, and he will personally show you our instruments.

Hibiscus:
Excuse me, are you busy right now?

Friendly Infected:
Oh, it's Hibiscus!

Friendly Infected:
I've got plenty of time.

Hibiscus:
It's about your condition...

Kreide:
Phew...

Kreide:
I was worried that clerk was going to report us to the authorities...

Ebenholz:
Nonsense, it's not like he knew you were an Infected. He just saw your shoddy clothes and took you for a commoner–

Ebenholz:
Tsk tsk... Looks like we forgot something.

Kreide:
We did?

Ebenholz:
Our suits, of course.

Ebenholz:
Surely you don't plan to wear this onstage. It's too unprofessional.

Ebenholz:
Let's go. I'll find you the best tailor in all of Vyseheim––

Kreide:
No, I can't. During the fitting, the Originium crystals would...

Ebenholz:
You do have a point.

Ebenholz:
In that case––We'll find the best tailor in the Afterglow. How about it?

Kreide:
The Sky is blue and fine...♪

Ebenholz:
Alright, alright.

Kreide:
I can't thank you enough. For buying this cello for me, and for helping me order a suit!

Ebenholz:
The cello's on me. And we haven't even gotten your clothes yet, nor do we know how they'll look on you. You can save your thanks for later.

Kreide:
We'll know by tomorrow afternoon! I'm sure they'll fit just great!

Kreide:
So, thank you!

Ebenholz:
Since we left the store, all you've been doing other than humming is thanking me. We've been over it a dozen times.

Kreide:
Hum, hum.

Kreide:
The River murmurs clear...♪

Ebenholz:
This tune...

Kreide:
What's the matter?

Ebenholz:
I think I've heard it before... Or maybe I haven't. Never mind, it's probably just my imagination.

Ebenholz:
By the way, you've studied the cello, so why don't you have one of your own? Did it break?

Kreide:
The teacher who taught me how to play did give me a cello, but it didn't take long for someone to mess it up. Even though it's still sitting back at home, by the time I leave this city... I might only be able to bring the bow with me.

Ebenholz:
Just the bow? What's the purpose of that?

Kreide:
Seeing the bow is enough to remind me of my teacher.

Kreide:
I'm afraid that if I were to lose the bow, I might forget my teacher as well.

Ebenholz:
Forget? Don't you remember your teacher just fine?

Kreide:
Actually, I'm already starting to forget...

Kreide:
My teacher was a nice Sankta lady with very long hair. She dressed plainly, and always had a smile on her face...

Kreide:
I used to remember a lot more, as if she were standing right before my eyes... But not anymore.

Kreide:
There are actually a lot of others I've wanted to remember...

Kreide:
So, I need a few keepsakes, to make sure that I won't completely forget.

Ebenholz:
Keepsakes, huh...?

Ebenholz:
What about right now? What do you plan to remember Czerny by?

Kreide:
I suppose a signature would do just fine.

Ebenholz:
What about Hibiscus from Rhodes Island?

Kreide:
For Hibiscus, maybe an empty medicine bottle with the Rhodes Island logo?

Ebenholz:
Pfft. You're too easy to please.

Kreide:
So long as it helps me remember, the actual object doesn't matter.

Ebenholz:
What about me then? It'd be this cello, wouldn't it?

Kreide:
Maybe something else.

Kreide:
The cello from my teacher didn't last very long. If this one also...

Ebenholz:
Fair enough.

Kreide:
I want to keep a coin that you gave me. Maybe punch a hole through it and wear it as a pendant. That sounds like a pretty good idea.

Ebenholz:
Money is how you'll remember me?!

Kreide:
Eh? Is there something wrong with that? Then, I'll pick something else...

Ebenholz:
No, no, it's a fine idea.

Ebenholz:
Shall we head back home and practice?

Kreide:
Actually, I was thinking... Why don't we pay a visit to Herr Czerny's first?

Ebenholz:
Oh?

Ebenholz:
I'll pass. It's no secret that he gets all pissy when he sees me.

Kreide:
I'm sure that's just a misunderstanding. It'll get cleared up.

Ebenholz:
You've been saying that since the first day we met him.

Ebenholz:
Even if it really is some sort of misunderstanding, I think we're well beyond the point of clearing anything up. So yes, I'll pass after all.

Kreide:
But Herr Czerny approved of you yesterday, didn't he?

Kreide:
All misunderstandings have to be resolved bit by bit.

Ebenholz:
......

Kreide:
Let's go. I want to see him so we can try out the cello you just got for me.

Kreide:
It'd be a shame if such a wonderful instrument didn't have a knowledgeable audience.

Hibiscus:
Excuse me, are you busy right now?

Skittish Infected:
Hibiscus? Sorry, but now's not a very good time.

Hibiscus:
I'd just like you to answer a few questions.

Hibiscus:
You're also free to not answer if there's anything you're not comfortable disclosing.

Skittish Infected:
You're not gonna take my blood?

Hibiscus:
I wouldn't do that without your consent.

Skittish Infected:
Okay.

Czerny:
I don't want to believe it, but this cello isn't something you can find in the Afterglow after one morning of shopping around.

Czerny:
You went to the Cliffy Patio, didn't you?

Kreide:
I did.

Czerny:
Bold of you.

Kreide:
Actually... Ebenholz got into an argument with a store clerk just so I could go into the store.

Czerny:
An argument? Did he think your clothes weren't fancy enough for the Cliffy Patio?

Ebenholz:
The clerk said something about 'not being able to enter the store unless dressed appropriately,' but do you see anything wrong with Kreide's attire? They were purposely fault-finding because Kreide was wearing commoner's clothes!

Czerny:
So you, a noble, have begun to fight for the commoners.

Ebenholz:
I did it for Kreide!

Ebenholz:
Regardless of whether he's a noble or a commoner, his skill is more than worthy of the instruments inside that store.

Ebenholz:
To deny Kreide entry but to sell those magnificent wares to nobles who needlessly fill their shelves with them would be to treat the finest lumber as firewood.

Czerny:
(Nods)

Czerny:
I didn't expect to hear those words out of your mouth.

Czerny:
Kreide, go ahead and get acquainted with your new instrument.

Czerny:
I'll accompany Ebenholz and have him practice solo for a bit. Let's see if we can change some of his old habits.

Ebenholz:
Change my habits...? I dare say––

Kreide:
Yes, Herr Czerny!

Kreide:
(Whispers) See, all misunderstandings have to be resolved bit by bit.

Kreide:
(Whispers) Herr Czerny's attitude is already changing. The rest is up to you.

Hibiscus:
Hello—

Rude Infected:
You that devil?

Rude Infected:
Git outta here. Do you have memory problems or somethin'?

Hibiscus:
Sorry to bother you.

Rude Infected:
––Git yer ass back here.

Hibiscus:
Did you need something?

Rude Infected:
You plannin' to go hide back in your office again, aren't you?

Hibiscus:
I—

Coffee Shop Owner:
You're being a bit unreasonable.

Rude Infected:
Who the hell d'you think you are––

Coffee Shop Owner:
You still owe me quite a lot of coffee money, so who do you think I am?

Rude Infected:
Oh, it's you, Herr Biegler... Sorry, didn't notice you there.

Hibiscus:
Thank you.

Biegler:
Don't mention it.

Biegler:
At the end of the day, the Afterglow is an Infected settlement. It's real lively here, but you'll run into plenty who can't be reasoned with. Best be careful out there.

Hibiscus:
Thank you for the reminder.

Biegler:
Here's my business card, with the phone number of my coffee shop on the front side. If you're ever thirsty, give me a call. We deliver too, real fast.

Hibiscus:
Haha...

Biegler:
By the way, hasn't Andante always been the one in charge of the Rhodes Island office? Did you just get dispatched over here?

Hibiscus:
Actually, I'm here to investigate some strange happenings.

Hibiscus:
Oh, Mr. Biegler, regarding your condition––

Biegler:
Strange happenings? What kind of strange are you talking about? I haven't heard a thing.

Hibiscus:
So this is what happened...

Gertrude:
How fares the situation?

Frivolous Noble:
Lachmann's plans proceeded spectacularly.

Frivolous Noble:
Graf Urtica's actions were largely within expectations. Though he did cause some hindrance to Lachmann, it was most likely accidental and did not incur any lasting consequences.

Gertrude:
That's nothing. I never expected Lachmann alone to drive Rhodes Island out of the Afterglow.

Frivolous Noble:
As for Czerny, he already had to expend most of the goodwill he's earned, not to mention copyrights, just to invite those haughty critics to the concert.

Frivolous Noble:
Word also has it that he held his nose and wrote a glowing recommendation for a noble's album that he held nothing but disdain for.

Gertrude:
For someone like him, there's no going back now that he's stooped to this level.

Gertrude:
What about the Sankta from a few days ago? If I remember right, when she applied for entry into the city, she said she came from Laterano to immerse herself in Leithanian culture?

Frivolous Noble:
According to the records, she concluded her tour around Vyseheim and left earlier today for her next destination.

Gertrude:
So we don't have to worry about her.

Gertrude:
Let's go. We should be on our way to Afterglow Hall.

Frivolous Noble:
But our appointment with Czerny isn't until tonight.

Gertrude:
There's no shortage of prep work to be done.

Gertrude:
Plus, if that one ever decides to head to Afterglow Hall on a whim, our hired muscle won't be enough to stop him. That's when things get troublesome.
