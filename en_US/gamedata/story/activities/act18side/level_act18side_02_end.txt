Andante tries his best to stop the tide of people approaching Hibiscus, but what a single person can do is limited.

The crowd quickly passes by Andante and surrounds Hibiscus.

Drunken Infected:
Don't make me repeat myself – outta my way!

Andante:
What are you people trying to do?! She's here to help you, so why are you doing this?!

Suspicious Infected:
This has nothing to do with you, Andante! If you're gonna protect this devil, then get her outta the Afterglow!

Andante:
Kreide? Hibiscus is in there... They're mobbing her!

Kreide:
Move, out of the way! Let me inside!!

Drunken Infected:
Huh? What hole did you crawl out of?

Drunken Infected:
Oh, I remember now. You're the kid who drifted into the Afterglow not too long ago, right? Be a nice lad and go back to taking care of your opa, and don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong!

Kreide:
Hibiscus only came here to help all of you! Why are you treating her like this?

Drunken Infected:
People like you will never understand. We're protecting our homes from the devils, so get lost!

Kreide:
Hibiscus isn't like that!

Kreide:
All I know is that Hibiscus is here to treat Oripathy, and she's whole-heartedly devoted to it. Can't you all see that?

Suspicious Infected:
Treat Oripathy? Whose Oripathy is she here to treat?

Hibiscus:
Kreide, you don't need to get involved with this! This is Vyseheim after all, they wouldn't dare––

Drunken Infected:
Wouldn't dare what?!

Kreide:
The cello?!

Hibiscus:
Are you out of your mind?!

Hibiscus:
If you've got a problem, come at me! What are you flinging Arts at him for? What's any of this got to do with him?!

Drunken Infected:
I... I wasn't trying to––

Suspicious Infected:
Why the hell do we have to answer to you? Get outta here, or we're gonna put a hole in your body just like we did with this cello here!

Suspicious Infected:
Someone's playing the flute?

Suspicious Infected:
Who wants a piece of us next, huh? Show yourself!

Meddlesome Infected:
......

Meddlesome Infected:
My... My heart won't stop pounding...

Suspicious Infected:
Scheiße, why'd he have to show up here...?

Drunken Infected:
Hey, where are all you people going? Why are you...?

Meddlesome Infected:
Did you not hear that sound?

Drunken Infected:
Wait... Could it be? Don't tell me it's––

Drunken Infected:
P-Please have mercy on me, I–– I just had a bit too much to drink. I absolutely meant you no disrespect...

Drunken Infected:
––What in the world am I doing?!

Hibiscus:
Kreide, are you alright? You're not hurt, are you?

Kreide:
I'm fine, but my cello...

Hibiscus:
Oh no... The body's been damaged so badly. Can it be fixed?

Kreide:
I don't know...

Hibiscus:
Thanks for coming to my aid.

Ebenholz:
Don't mention it.

Ebenholz:
It's a pleasure to meet you–– Or perhaps, 'meet' wouldn't be the right word. However, I haven't had a chance to say hello until now.

Ebenholz:
To be honest, you were in quite a bit of danger back there. Even though the Afterglow is technically part of Vyseheim, your average patrolman has no desire to come around here.

Ebenholz:
If they really decided to attack you, there's a good chance nobody would've come to help you for a while.

Hibiscus:
Then I must thank you again. And to whom do I owe the pleasure?

Ebenholz:
Just call me Ebenholz.

Hibiscus:
Then, Ebenholz, have you heard of the prophecy they were talking about?

Ebenholz:
Not even once. Just caught wind of it from the crowd here.

Hibiscus:
In other words, this prophecy hasn't reached the Cliffy Patio at all...

Ebenholz:
The Cliffy Patio?

Hibiscus:
That's where all the nobles in Vyseheim live, right?

Ebenholz:
Don't lump me in with the lot of them.

Hibiscus:
Huh? But aren't you Vyseheim's...?

Ebenholz:
I'm actually not a native of Vyseheim.

Ebenholz:
Besides, it's discourteous to casually speculate about a noble's identity.

Hibiscus:
......

Hibiscus:
Then did you come all the way into the Afterglow to perform in Mr. Czerny's concert? Are you also an Infected?

Ebenholz:
Sorry, but I don't have Oripathy.

Hibiscus:
But I heard from someone that only Infected are performing––

Ebenholz:
That's enough chit-chat for now.

Hibiscus:
Are you in a hurry?

Ebenholz:
Of course I am.

Ebenholz:
Kreide and I were going to Herr Czerny's house to have him assess our practice today, but then all this broke out.

Hibiscus:
Sorry for wasting your time.

Hibiscus:
I'll be heading back to the office now.

Kreide:
......

Ebenholz:
Alright, don't start moping on me. Let's head to Mr. Czerny's first. I'm sure he'll find you a new instrument, seeing as how he's so fond of you.

Kreide:
Hey...

Ebenholz:
Come, I was only joking around.

Kreide:
Don't worry about it.

Ebenholz:
But that sure is strange. I haven't heard about 'His Majesty's Prophecy' or anything of the sort.

Ebenholz:
(Could it have been Gertrude?)

Kreide:
I think I've heard something along those lines before... But only very vaguely, and there never was any mention of Sarkaz.

Ebenholz:
Well, whatever. The concert is the only thing that matters.

Ebenholz:
What a quaint group of people though. If they really care so much, they should head to the door of the Empresses' Voice and start hollering 'His Majesty, His Majesty.' Now that would be a fun show.

Ebenholz:
But, let's set that aside for now and head to Mr. Czerny's place.

Kreide:
But, my cello...

Ebenholz:
I already told you, Mr. Czerny will get a new one for you.

Ebenholz:
Besides, it's not your fault. Even if Mr. Czerny wanted you to pay him back for that cello, you've still got me.

Kreide:
Right.

Czerny:
The cello is broken?

Czerny:
What, did the two of you decide to jump into a fight?!

Ebenholz:
No, that's not what happened–

Czerny:
Then what happened, Kreide?

Ebenholz:
......

Kreide:
Ebenholz and I ran into Hibiscus while we were on our way here.

Czerny:
Hibiscus?

Kreide:
She was surrounded, attacked by a group of people, calling her a devil and saying that she'd bring disaster to the Afterglow.

Czerny:
What nonsense.

Kreide:
I was trying to defend her, and... the cello got blasted by somebody's Arts.

Czerny:
Casting Arts out in the open streets? What's going on in peoples' heads these days?

Czerny:
And so you managed to beat them back?

Kreide:
No, Ebenholz dispersed them with his Arts, and helped get me and Hibiscus out.

Czerny:
He helped you?

Kreide:
Yes.

Czerny:
Alright, I have a clear picture now.

Czerny:
This poor cello... Alas, it was the only decent one I had.

Kreide:
I'm sorry...

Czerny:
Don't apologize, you didn't do anything wrong. If anything, I should be the one apologizing to you on behalf of the Afterglow for those idiots.

Czerny:
In any case, just put the cello over here. I'll go look around and see if there's anything suitable for you to use.

Czerny:
All that's left is this mass-produced one.

Czerny:
You'll have to make do with it. Now let's hear how much you've progressed in your practice.

Czerny:
Begin!

Czerny:
......

Ebenholz:
Herr Czerny... What'd you think of that?

Czerny:
......

Czerny:
I won't say there was no improvement.

Czerny:
And considering how the two of you have only been practicing for a day, I shouldn't expect too much.

Czerny:
But it doesn't seem that any of the problems from before have been fixed.

Ebenholz:
None of the problems from before have been fixed? How could that be––

Ebenholz:
......

Czerny:
You're reacting a lot faster now, Ebenholz, but you're still getting carried away in your own passages as if you're trying to show off. In the end, you still need Kreide to accommodate you.

Czerny:
You're not even familiar with the music yet, so what are you trying to show off for?

Ebenholz:
......

Czerny:
And then there are those ornaments. You managed to hit them all, but it's making your breathing completely uneven. What's the point of that?

Czerny:
Kreide, on the other hand, is more solid in comparison. His main problem is insufficient mastery, something that can be solved with more practice.

Czerny:
But at the end of the day, 'Morgen und Abend' is a duet. It is impossible for one person to constantly be accommodating the other.

Czerny:
In all honesty, I would prefer to strike 'Morgen und Abend.'

Kreide:
Herr Czerny...

Czerny:
What is it?

Kreide:
How about this, can we try again with you accompanying Ebenholz on piano?

Czerny:
Are you sure that's a good idea?

Czerny:
I won't be playing around him like you do. Don't blame me if he makes an utter fool of himself.

Kreide:
It'll be fine.

Ebenholz:
......

Kreide:
(Whispers) Chipper up. I know you can settle this in one go.

Ebenholz:
(Nods)

Czerny:
Are you ready?

Ebenholz:
(Takes a deep breath)

Ebenholz:
Let's go.

Ebenholz:
––How's that!

Kreide:
Herr Czerny...

Czerny:
Your braggadocio hasn't changed at all. What do you take your flute for? A tool to help you show off?

Ebenholz:
......

Czerny:
However...

Czerny:
I had no intention of matching your rhythm at all, but you more or less managed to stay steady throughout your part.

Czerny:
It's clear to me now that while Kreide IS accommodating you, he's covering for your bad habits rather than for a lack of skill.

Czerny:
While there's still ample room for improvement, you've at least met my minimum threshold.

Kreide:
So that means...

Czerny:
You pass.

Kreide:
Fantastic!

Ebenholz:
(Lets out a long sigh)

Czerny:
I won't pull my punches though. I've already had to lower my standards to rock bottom today.

Czerny:
I may ask you to show me your progress at any time. If you're still playing at this level before the concert, I will not let you step onto that stage. Am I clear?

Kreide:
Rest assured!

Czerny:
Additionally, Kreide, you're playing on a mass-produced instrument right now, and it is only for emergency use. I would still recommend you find something else.

Kreide:
But the one you gave me is...

Ebenholz:
Don't worry, I'll cover you.

Czerny:
Oh?

Ebenholz:
Let's go shopping tomorrow morning. I'll get you the very best.

Gullible Infected:
What is it?

Suspicious Infected:
So I was telling you about His Majesty, right? His Majesty's prophecy!

Gullible Infected:
No foolin'? Tell me more about it while we walk. I'd like to hear it again, in detail...
