Bishop:
Mixed-breeds... You mixed-breeds!

Bishop:
Herald! What's the meaning of this?! Why are they still alive? What of theirs is worth sparing?!

Bishop:
You must have realized they were nothing like you when first they slaughtered our bloodkin!

Bishop:
You are a holy being, and they are mere filth!

Gladiia:
*Spit*...

Gladiia:
Very flexible, eh?

Gladiia:
We hacked away at your kind with cold weapons so as to not expose you to our technology. That way, you will never become something we can't deal with.

Gladiia:
But I guess I overestimated. You don't seem very sensitive at all... Can't even adjust to this much?

Gladiia:
Looks like you just can't adapt to blades forged by Ægir technology. Am I right?

Seaborn:
—

Bishop:
Herald, she is insulting you!

Gladiia:
Bishop, oh, bishop... Can't you tell? Heh. Yes, I am confident I can kill you, and I could have done so right from the start.

Seaborn:
(Low roar)

Seaborn:
Ugh... (Cough)

Seaborn:
Brother, why won't you accept them?

Seaborn:
They are my sisters, and so they are your sisters too.

Seaborn:
I can rouse you, rouse Ishar-mla, and, of course... Gla-dia too.

Seaborn:
Just because your brothers swam for the shallow seas, you no longer recognize them as your brothers. You haven't looked back even once...

Seaborn:
But our tribe cares.

Bishop:
No... This is nonsense...

Gladiia:
So you believe every single word in that good book you're holding? Let me remind you, Bishop, but you, too, are spreading heresy in full view of the Iberians.

Gladiia:
It doesn't matter to me one bit what this thing tells me, but you are from the Church of the Deep. Perhaps you should be taking notes?

Bishop:
Kill them... Kill them! Herald, do it! Their crimes are grave and unforgivable! They spout blasphemy against you and the sea!

Seaborn:
If that is your wish... then I shall do it.

Bishop:
It doesn't matter to you at all, does it? It doesn't matter if I ask this of you. You said so yourself! You will kill them!

Seaborn:
Yes, It doesn't matter to me.

Bishop:
Then kill the... wandering singer first. Kill the one in the red dress!

Gladiia:
Trash. If I tell you to kill the person behind you, the bishop who's dressed like a strand of kelp, will you do it?

Seaborn:
Yes.

Bishop:
...!!!

Seaborn:
Because he is my kin, and so are you. He calls out to me, and so do you.

Gladiia:
Ah, humans.

Gladiia:
Ægir are vile and hideous, aren't they? Admit it, Bishop.

Gladiia:
We are all foolish Ægir, and we like to apply what we think to lowlife beasts. You don't understand it at all.

Bishop:
You mixed-blood!

Gladiia:
Well, if all you want is to protect us—Why not refuse?

Seaborn:
Refuse?

Seaborn:
How do I... refuse?

Gladiia:
Enough. Looks like you are indeed a lowlife. That's about as deep as you can swim.

Gladiia:
But listen up, Trash. I won't ask you to kill the weakling behind you.

Gladiia:
You are prey. Who would beg prey to do something?

Gladiia:
You want to hurt her? You will listen to his suggestion and kill Skadi, my hunter? You don't need that answer anymore, do you?

Seaborn:
I have other ways, even with her dead. As long as there's a way, it doesn't matter to me.

Seaborn:
But you told me... to refuse...

Gladiia:
Way too soon... *cough*...

Gladiia:
(Coughs up blood)

Gladiia:
*Spit*. Whatever. If you have your heart set on killing her—You must first go through me.

Seaborn:
Now, Gla-dia.

Seaborn:
Whether you get to live and whether your flesh will continue to function... This is for you to decide.

Gladiia:
And let us decide that by hunting each other.

Seaborn:
Each other... Each other. Yes. We will prey on each other. You will prey on me, and I will prey on you.
