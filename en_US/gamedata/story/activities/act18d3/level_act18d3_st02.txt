High Inquisitor:
Dr. Kal'tsit, I would like an explanation.

Skadi:
I knew things weren't as simple as they seemed...

Kal'tsit:
The Inquisition is simply keeping too many more secrets than the Iberian people deserve to know.

High Inquisitor:
My lady, need I remind you that spreading rumors and hearsay is strictly forbidden in Iberia?

Kal'tsit:
High Inquisitor, I'm only saying this because you already know those secrets.

Kal'tsit:
The Church of the Deep has infiltrated Iberia and is taking root here in secret.

Kal'tsit:
They took advantage of the relationship you once had with the sea. Abandoned Iberian cities have become the beachhead for the Church of the Deep's encroachment onto dry land.

Kal'tsit:
They have their own interpretations of your scriptures, and they use them to bend your will. They also hide well. With so many irons in the fire, there was never any way for you to attend to all of it.

Kal'tsit:
So... you should cry out for help. If you continue this pointless war of territory and faith, we will miss our one chance.

Kal'tsit:
Your Honor, Iberians are different.

Kal'tsit:
The skyline that you see every day is different from what everyone else who walks this world sees.

Kal'tsit:
What do you call the place where you live every day and night? The coast.

Kal'tsit:
Other peoples live on land, while Iberians live by the coast.

Kal'tsit:
For the majority of the population, whether they live in the wilderness or the cities, their sightlines are the sky above and an endless swath of land and mountains ahead.

Kal'tsit:
Anything above the clouds means nothing.

Kal'tsit:
When they talk about 'the world', they refer to these lands alone.

Kal'tsit:
The land on which they live is the world to them, because they've decided there is nothing in this world beyond these lands.

Kal'tsit:
Whether residing in sealed-off cities, out-of-the-way villages, or hostile wilderness, they believe in what they see, and nothing else.

Kal'tsit:
Now look at them again. These Abyssal Hunters. These Ægir.

Kal'tsit:
The ocean is vast in ways beyond the land.

Kal'tsit:
Iberia is not like other countries.

Kal'tsit:
Those who reside on land are obsessed with their ways and their authorities. They overlook the infinite possibilities, and the opportunities to explore the boundaries that they blindly choose to ignore.

Kal'tsit:
Your world is far more complete. You understand both the land and the sea. Iberia has a much better knowledge of its place in the world than anyone else.

Kal'tsit:
This has given you a huge lead over everyone in the past.

High Inquisitor:
That is enough.

High Inquisitor:
This is all water under the bridge. The radiance of the cities has faded, and Iberia is nothing but a pile of rubble today.

Kal'tsit:
What a surprise. I thought you would dodge the subject.

High Inquisitor:
You are here, and you are certainly not blind. Look out and see for yourself.

High Inquisitor:
Cities like Sal Viento line the entire Iberian coastline.

Iberia was once a prosperous nation, but how many of these ruins can be found here today?

Kal'tsit knows, and naturally the High Inquisitor knows too. However, with the High Inquisitor's steely composure, it is impossible to discern any kind of emotion from his expression whatsoever.

Furthermore, he is wearing a mask.

If they could cry, then the Iberians would definitely cry. If they could laugh, then the Iberians would definitely laugh out loud.

Yet here stands one such impassioned Iberian, who has since turned into the emotionless man before her.

Without expression and without emotion. Iberia's golden age has passed into a life of tranquility.

High Inquisitor:
There are too many.

High Inquisitor:
We cannot support them, and many cities are unable to support themselves.

High Inquisitor:
Ever since the Profound Silence Iberia is not what it once was.

Kal'tsit:
Then you need the support of others all the more.

High Inquisitor:
No one knows what happened to Iberia, and no one may know.

Kal'tsit:
Because Iberia was once on the brink of total destruction?

High Inquisitor:
Even now, Iberia cannot be destroyed.

Kal'tsit:
You are still here, and so are the Iberian people.

Kal'tsit:
I believe that even if not a single city remained...

Kal'tsit:
Iberia's citizens won't give up so easily.

Kal'tsit:
High Inquisitor, please allow me.

Kal'tsit:
Pride and prejudice have destroyed the Ægir. This land must not repeat the mistakes of the deep sea folk.

Kal'tsit:
If Iberia falls to the aftershock of this disaster, then there will no longer be anyone who knows the true face of the sea, and the horror of the threat it poses.

Kal'tsit:
Just like a certain hunt in the tundra roughly a century ago. It is the territory of mankind that we are guarding, not the honor and reputation of a nation, against the sea monsters, and against anything else.

Kal'tsit:
Besides, if Iberia keeps lingering on with its last breath...

Kal'tsit:
In that case, Iberia will one day meet its fate.

Kal'tsit:
As of now, you can still rebuild your homeland, rebuild Iberia.

High Inquisitor:
I don't believe that.

Kal'tsit:
My objective isn't to get you to see things my way.

Kal'tsit:
This question has to be answered, and a decision has to be made. It doesn't necessarily need to be answered by you, nor does it have to be now.

High Inquisitor:
—

High Inquisitor:
We still must resolve the Sal Viento affair.

High Inquisitor:
One of them will have to stay.

Specter:
I will.

Skadi:
No.

Gladiia:
You two need to go back.

Gladiia:
Kal'tsit, we will do as we discussed. I won't be there to lead them, so you will have to take my place.

Skadi:
You...?

Skadi:
What's this supposed to mean?

Kal'tsit:
...

Kal'tsit:
High Inquisitor, perhaps I can take their place?

Kal'tsit:
I can serve as a proxy for them in your interrogations. I can straighten out the details of the events that transpired here, and you will get the information that you need.

Kal'tsit:
I can survive an Iberian prison.

High Inquisitor:
—

High Inquisitor:
If you insist.

Gladiia:
Lady Kal'tsit?

Skadi:
Doctor...?

High Inquisitor:
You want me to expel them from our territory?

Kal'tsit:
For now at the very least.

Kal'tsit:
The three of you—

Kal'tsit:
Go back to Rhodes Island. Misery will pick you up near the northeastern border. Don't take the waterways this time.

High Inquisitor:
The Inquisition will determine the route they will take.

Kal'tsit:
As long as the destination remains unchanged, you may route them however you want.

Gladiia:
When will you come back? I can't wait for you too long.

High Inquisitor:
That is not for her to decide.

Gladiia:
Let's not jump to conclusions yet, little birdie of Iberia. A prison's walls are as paper to me.

Kal'tsit:
Gladiia, no.

Gladiia:
So you want me to watch him take you away?

Kal'tsit:
That's right.

Kal'tsit:
Don't worry about me, Gladiia.

Kal'tsit:
Now go, hunters. Surely a heart-to-heart with Specter must be on the agenda. Now that she's awake, she can give you the answers you've always wanted. Her own answers.

Specter:
And you have nothing to say to me? This is a rare opportunity for everyone, yourself included.

Kal'tsit:
Hmm...

Kal'tsit:
I'm afraid I don't have any suitable advice for a hunter like you.

Specter:
Am I too hasty for your liking?

Kal'tsit:
No, but you understand your own situation far better than I.

Kal'tsit:
In any case, I don't know how much longer you can maintain your current state... Though I suppose that's the least of your worries.

Specter:
How do you know?

Kal'tsit:
Just a hunch. You are in a good mood, after all. I'm sure it matters to you very little whether you are awake or not, Specter. After all, the way things are now is not that bad for you.

Specter:
You needn't tell me. Nothing has ever been completely optimal for us.

Specter:
And if I contemplate the future? That would be such a drag. My standards are much lower than yours. As long as things are decently sorted, they're good enough for me.

Kal'tsit:
I suppose so.

Specter:
I am not one to preach the Church of the Deep's words, but that was me as well. There is no point in hating myself.

Specter:
If anyone wants to know the difference, then let them listen to me talk. I will settle for giving them a hard time.

Kal'tsit:
Is this how you used to be?

Specter:
Perhaps, Dr. Kal'tsit.

Specter:
Besides, I finally have some old friends here with me, not some landlubber that I wouldn't know how to talk to, even if I wanted to talk. You know, they haven't even seen seaweed before.

Kal'tsit:
You could teach them.

Kal'tsit:
You still have a lot of new friends at that place you can now go back to.

Kal'tsit:
In the future, your colleagues will need you. I will need all of you as well.

Kal'tsit:
We need you.

Kal'tsit:
Besides—

Specter:
Well, don't come home too late!

Kal'tsit:
This doctor is never late, Specter.

Gladiia:
Let's go, hunters. We'll leave the rest to her. She can take it.

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
Wait, Captain. I still have something to tell her.

Skadi:
Lady Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
Deploying without any approval again, Skadi.

Kal'tsit:
At least you knew well enough to talk to Engineering and get them to prepare that case for you. They contacted me straight away.

Kal'tsit:
You're doing much better than before.

Skadi:
I didn't expect you to actually come help me...

Kal'tsit:
I told you, I'm a woman of my word, and that goes no matter what it is you are up to.

Kal'tsit:
Now go home to Rhodes Island. Enjoy your vacation.

Kal'tsit glances at Skadi.

She doesn't say anything but starts smiling.

Kal'tsit:
All of us have things that are simply beyond our abilities. Even Dr. {@nickname} struggles from time to time.

Kal'tsit:
Our technology is not yet able to cure your infection... And neither can you.

Kal'tsit:
But, Specter, not being able to eradicate it doesn't mean you can't defeat it.

Kal'tsit:
You can't exterminate shadows, but you can make them your friend.

Kal'tsit:
Skadi...

Kal'tsit:
There isn't much you can do about your dark fate... but you can learn to work alongside it.

Kal'tsit:
Perhaps only you can wrestle tooth and nail with it till the end of times.

Anita:
Oh, it's you, singer! You are back!

Skadi:
Yes.

Anita:
Huh? Where's your sax... uh... saxophone?

Skadi:
No idea...

Anita:
Oh, don't worry. I'm sure you left it somewhere around here. I'll help you look for it.

Anita:
Also, about your harp. You dropped it yesterday. I've been holding onto it for you.

Skadi:
It's yours now.

Anita:
I can have it... Just like we promised? Does that mean you've found your friend? That's great news, singer. I'm so happy for you!

Anita:
But... you look really tired... You look more tired than you were last night. Are you hurt?

Skadi:
I... It's okay. I'm just a little dizzy.

Anita:
Well, okay. I didn't see you, and I was so worried you ran into some kind of trouble.

Anita:
Something really amazing happened just now. Did you see that? There was an explosion, then another. Like, bang bang bang, boooom! The mountain over that way kept shaking, and then it suddenly came crashing down!

Anita:
I thought our house would come crashing down too.

Skadi:
Are you all okay?

Anita:
We're fine. The only problem is that all our food is still inside. It's already rotten. Erm, we'll probably go hungry for a while again.

Anita:
It's all thanks to the Inquisitor. She was the one who told us to leave the house and to stay away from the coast and the chapel up on the hill.

Skadi:
She helped you.

Anita:
Yeah, she's such a nice person. She protected us the whole time.

Inquisitor Irene:
Ahem.

Skadi:
Got a sore throat?

Inquisitor Irene:
*cough* *cough*— Y-You wretch! No matter, I will let you off the hook just this once. Tsk, you're a lucky one, Ægir. The High Inquisitor didn't take you away.

Skadi:
You've been waiting for me.

Inquisitor Irene:
I knew you'd be back... I have something to tell you.

Skadi:
Still haven't given up?

Inquisitor Irene:
What...? Why are you in a fighting stance? I haven't even drawn my weapon!

Inquisitor Irene:
W-What I'm trying to say is... I'm sorry I was so harsh with you before.

Skadi:
Hm?

Inquisitor Irene:
I'm not the kind of person... who doesn't apologize when she's done wrong. I may be an Inquisitor, but when an Inquisitor makes a mistake, she needs to reflect on it all the more.

Inquisitor Irene:
When you first stepped into the town, I saw you right away. I could tell you were an Ægir, costume or no. You are different.

Skadi:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
At the time... I was angry, and my passions were inflamed. I thought I had finally found the answer. The evil outsiders, the culprit who brought this misfortune to us—

Inquisitor Irene:
I thought that by dragging you out here and defeating you... I could right the wrongs and solve our problems. I thought it was that simple.

Inquisitor Irene:
But I am no match for you, and what could defeating you change anyway?

Inquisitor Irene:
The real threat that this city and all Iberia faces is not a single Ægir or two.

Skadi:
You've grown...

Inquisitor Irene:
Much thanks to you...

Inquisitor Irene:
I can't think the way I used to think anymore. What happened here has left me bewildered to the point that I'm not sure how I'd judge anything again.

Inquisitor Irene:
I am an inquisitor. It is my duty to eradicate the threats that Iberia faces in order to uphold its order.

Inquisitor Irene:
—You are a threat, but are you our enemy?

Inquisitor Irene:
Then we have the people here. Should I protect them, or should they be eliminated?

Inquisitor Irene:
And what if I can't make sense of it? What, then, is my reason for taking up the sword? It will leave me directionless, stuck in the same spot, just like the people here.

Inquisitor Irene:
Then—It was you and the locals who helped me see things clearly.

Inquisitor Irene:
I can't save the inhabitants... It probably sounds strange, but once I realized this, I made the decision to protect them.

Inquisitor Irene:
At the very least, at that very moment and right now, I know what is right and what is wrong.

Inquisitor Irene:
As for you, you did the right thing. You protected this place... for the time being, at least. That is much more than I have ever done for these people.

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
You did the right thing too.

Inquisitor Irene:
Huh?

Skadi:
What I did was no different from what you did.

Inquisitor Irene:
What do you mean, no different...? No matter, you are just as terrible at giving comfort as you are at disguises.

Skadi:
You wanted comfort from me?

Inquisitor Irene:
What do you...? No, no thank you.

Skadi:
Good. I don't have any for you either.

Inquisitor Irene:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
So, you found the answer you were looking for?

Skadi:
I don't need it anymore.

Skadi:
I've asked too many questions. I found my answer, and once I calmed down, I realized those answers meant nothing really. Just like you, I know which way I am headed now.

Inquisitor Irene:
Oh? Seems we're both ready.

Inquisitor Irene:
It's about time I get going, and I know it's time for you to go as well. You have gone free, so you must've come to some kind of agreement with the High Inquisitor.

Inquisitor Irene:
Well... Goodbye.

Inquisitor Irene:
As long as we're still chasing the same goal, perhaps we will see each other again somewhere.

Anita:
Huh? Did the Inquisitor leave? What a shame. I want her to see what I'm making.

Skadi:
What's this...?

Anita:
It's the seaweed alcohol you taught me to make! Uh, is this looking okay? Are the pieces too big still?

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
They are way too small.

Anita:
Huh? Let me try again. It's okay. We don't have any food left, but we still have plenty of seaweed. If we run out, I'll get some more from Uncle Fireplace.

Skadi:
You will get better.

Anita:
Once I'm finished... Uh... You'll be gone by the time I'm finished, right? You came here to tell me this, didn't you? You are leaving.

Skadi:
Yes, I'm leaving.

Anita:
(Subconsciously kneads the seaweed)

Anita:
Right, you're a wandering singer. You wander, only stopping once in a while.

Anita:
Will you ever come back? I... I want to listen to you play your harp and sing some more. Grandma Petra and Drywall, they do too.

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
Yes, I will.

Skadi:
My friends, too. We can come together.

Anita:
That sounds great!

Anita:
It's a promise, okay? Be sure to come back soon! I will be waiting for you here.

Inhabitant:
Woodframe.

Anita:
Uh, here! Singer, they need me for something. I gotta go.

Anita:
Don't forget what you promised!

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
That can there...

Skadi:
The red shell.

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
Anita!

Anita:
Yes?

Skadi:
If next we meet on the outside, I'll still sing for you.

Anita:
Okay! Looks like I gotta keep your harp in my box.

Anita:
See you, singer!

Skadi:
—

Skadi:
See you.

Gladiia:
Dammit.

Gladiia:
Dammit!

Gladiia caresses her face in the mirror.

Gladiia:
Look at you. You still ended up an ugly bitch in the end.

Gladiia:
You should've died in the deep sea. Is this what you wanted? You should've died with everyone else instead of going into hiding here. Constantly on edge, no matter what you do, even breathing, much less letting them hear your singing.

Gladiia:
You have to shut yourself up in a landship's bathroom just to complain about your predicament, never again to ride the waves. All you can do is to wait until you fully transform into a beast.

Gladiia:
Look, this is you.

Gladiia:
It's too soon... Too soon.

Gladiia:
The ship... I need to find that ship.

Before the waves engulf the world and those monstrous colossi summon their bloodkin, we must smother the sea with silence. Its brood will know nothing of this.

We will exterminate them at their source.

This is our only chance. This will bring about a calamity... but Ægir will get its moment of reprieve.

I can't hear Ægir. Heh, just like the monsters waiting in vain for their revelations.

Nonetheless, we have a responsibility. The Abyssal Hunters must be the first to uncover Iberia's secrets.

—The last dreadnought of the Iberian fleet. Indomitable, yet disappearing without a trace in the span of a night.

Gladiia stops gazing at herself in the mirror.

This is my duty. I must defend Ægir.

By capturing that golden ship and taking hold of that key, the doors to the vault will fling wide open, and the volcano shall be unleashed.
