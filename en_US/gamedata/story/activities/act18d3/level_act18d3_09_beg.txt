Gladiia:
Skadi, can you move?

Skadi:
I don't know. It's tough... to keep that kind of feeling under control. It's hard not to think about it.

Skadi:
I can't move my fingers. It feels like my nails will all swim away if I tried to.

Gladiia:
Your neural cells are rapidly metabolizing. Remember, you are a hunter. They can't do anything to you.

Skadi:
Is thinking about that going to help?

Gladiia:
If you don't want to become a Seaborn, this will help wonders.

Skadi:
Okay.

Skadi:
I think... I can still pick up my weapon.

Bishop:
A mixed blood without a weapon, another who's injured, and a third one that's infected. What can you even hope to accomplish?

Bishop:
Look at that expression of yours? Are you starting to think yourself noble now?

Skadi:
Me?

Skadi:
Wait, strange... I'm afraid you misunderstood.

Skadi:
I might have felt sorry for the Seaborn, but if you think I feel the same about you, you have another thing coming. Once I kill you, it'll be all over.

Gladiia:
—

Gladiia:
Do you really think that's a saxophone in her case?

Gladiia:
Little mermaid, how much longer will you sleep? Open your eyes. The things that happened in the past can't possibly have you trapped.

Bishop:
She was a mere test subject as well!

Skadi:
Shark, you've been awake for a while, haven't you?

Bishop:
What...? Even such a high-density Originium liquid...?

Gladiia:
It's great to see you're the same as ever, Shark.

Skadi:
Ugh, I've almost forgotten she always used to be like this.

Skadi:
Ahh... My hand still feels rather numb.

Skadi:
I didn't spend all these years with Rhodes Island to come unprepared for something like this. Here.

Specter:
Here I was thinking I could keep being the courteous lady I am for just a little longer.

Specter:
I've spent such a long time as an adorable, well-behaved nun, I wasn't sure how I'd approach you two.

Gladiia:
Enough. Come out already.

Skadi:
It's been a very long time. I'm not sure if I'm more used to how you are now or back when you were all deranged and high-strung.

Specter:
Wow, so tough.

Gladiia:
Shark, come back! He's a Seaborn now!

Skadi:
Captain, Specter... Let's get out of here!

Bishop:
You... mixed-bloods... I will destroy—

The bishop's body begins to expand rapidly.

As his body grows, he swings his long appendages around in sweeping motions, smashing the walls of the cave to a crumble in an instant.

Bishop:
You... Urghh...

Bishop:
You push... your luck... too far...

The bishop's skull cracks open between his eyes.

His eyelids break off from his large eyeballs. The hunters' retreat is reflected in the glass objects that lie there.

Countless tentacles quickly bulge out from what had been its slender, frail body. They then swipe at these insects that it had once only ridiculed.

Seawater begins to fill the cave, just as the bishop's body continues to expand.

The bishop's wriggling destroys all of the equipment in its vicinity. Its body is no different than that of the Seaborn, yet the anger it exudes is undoubtedly human.

Bishop:
(Noisy and hurried twitching sounds)

Specter:
How did he grow this big all of a sudden? What did he do to stuff all this meat in his body?

Specter:
Ha, look. His head split into two. Remember, the right side is mine.

Bishop:
(Bizarre sounds)

Skadi:
How come you people are always howling...?

Bishop:
(Human speech-like sounds)

Gladiia:
Act quick, or your prey will get away. Either that, or it will die at the hands of another hunter.

Bishop:
You...

Bishop:
(Sudden skeleton rocking sounds) ...You...

Bishop:
(Bubble popping sounds) ...Mixed-bloods...!

Specter:
Look at him, so soreheaded that he can't even form a full sentence.

Gladiia:
He's not human anymore. Preys like this one are only valuable when the hunters hunt them. Let's go! Go up!

Inhabitant:
......

Inhabitant:
Er...

Male Inhabitant B:
What's... going on?

Anita:
The earth is shaking... Is it the hill next to the shore? Looks like something's falling. I can see it through the window here. Is that... the chapel?

Anita:
Ahh—The house is shaking too. My box, the food... Grandma Petra!

Grandma Petra:
*cough*, *cough* *cough* *cough*...

Inquisitor Irene:
Everyone, please head outside with me at once! It's dangerous to stay inside—

Inhabitant:
......

Inhabitant:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
Eh, what am I doing, wasting my breath!

Inquisitor Irene:
Alright, come—

Anita:
Huh, Inquisitor... You lifted Grandma Petra up in one go?!

Inquisitor Irene:
Stop standing around! I know you understand what I'm saying! Do you have any idea how old this house is? It's going to collapse after a few quakes!

Inquisitor Irene:
I'm not sure what's happening at the chapel, but they went there... Things might even... Ugh! Whatever happens next, it's not going to be my problem!

Anita:
Drywall, Brick, Stonecolumn, Uncle Fireplace! Take my hand! Drywall, bring a few more people with you...!

Anita:
Follow the Inquisitor! Let's get out!

Inquisitor Irene:
Phew...

Inquisitor Irene:
Finally... Looks like everyone made it.

Male Inhabitant C:
The hill... The chapel.

Male Inhabitant D:
Food...

Male Inhabitant C:
Food...

Male Inhabitant D:
Priest...

Inquisitor Irene:
You're still worried about that wolf in sheep's clothing?!

Inquisitor Irene:
It's like you don't know who put you in this situation... Ugh... Very well! You, stop where you are! Come back!

Grandma Petra:
Mm... Ugh...

Anita:
Grandma Petra... Did you open your eyes? I'm here, Grandma...

Inquisitor Irene:
Hey, watch out!

Anita:
R-Rocks! They're falling from the roof—

Anita:
Uh, Inquisitor, did you block that for us?

Inquisitor Irene:
You...

Anita:
Grandma Petra is looking at you, Inquisitor. She's thanking you.

Inquisitor Irene:
Hold on tighter, then...

Anita:
You're bleeding.

Inquisitor Irene:
Tsk... It was that bash I took just now. It kinda hurts, too.

Inquisitor Irene:
You helped me when the Sea Terror attacked me, too. We'll call ourselves even.

Inquisitor Irene:
Why am I even doing this to begin with...? It's not like any of you are ever scared of anything. You don't even run away when your lives are in danger. Does that even count as being alive?

Inquisitor Irene:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
Her song... is still stuck in my head.

Anita:
Inquisitor, the singer isn't here. Is that going to be a problem?

Inquisitor Irene:
Problem...? Hmph, I guess what you think is a problem isn't that kind of problem.

Inquisitor Irene:
You know what she's like... If she does actually have a problem, I'm sure the answer to your question wouldn't be too shabby.

Inquisitor Irene:
If you want to know how that will turn out, you'll just have to wait. Perhaps she will... actually give you a decent answer.

Skadi:
We're almost there to the chapel!

Specter:
It isn't stopping!

The tentacles reach upwards, crushing all the falling rocks into dust. The gravels collide into the surrounding walls and cause them to fissure.

Specter's saw is rumbling, and the moment the tentacles draw near her, a smirk appears on her face.

Specter:
I wonder how long it has been since I had to take on a prey like you? This is becoming delightful.

Specter swings her saw in one horizontal stroke, striking it on the wall. A huge hole appears in the granite rockface.

She uses the momentum to flip herself up. At the same time, the saw traces a grayish path beneath her that intersects a tentacle.

A sharp slicing sound rings through the air, slicing the tentacle in two.

With her hair fluttering in the air, the 'nun' grabs what had been a part of the stairs and pushes before continuing her dash toward the chapel.

She gazes at the cross section of the tentacle. A few tiny spores are bulging out of that translucent white area.

Specter:
Do you hear that? Its cells are screaming just like us.

Skadi:
It has emotions. It used to be an Ægir... No. No more, and it could hardly be called one before.

Suddenly, the tip of its severed tentacle releases the spores, and several sharp-edged streams of liquid gush out toward the hunters.

Skadi flips her sword and presses the blade against her body as a shield.

The three liquid streams hit the blade, pushing Skadi back by several meters. The liquid splashes onto the rockface nearby, boring a few small holes before evaporating.

Skadi:
The pressure's even higher than the waterjet on my workbench.

Specter:
It's looking at us.

Skadi:
Think of something. Is this thing going to keep growing without end?

All of a sudden, the eyes on the head of the 'bishop' let out a strange beam.

Skadi:
Energy beam?!

That moment, Gladiia's lance slashes the sight organs of the 'bishop.'

A hard membrane layer immediately covers the monster's eyes. The lance's tip leaves a long trail of scar on the membrane.

She then leaps upward as the monster howls in vexation below.

The hunters are almost there to the bottom of the building; the chapel's floor has already crumbled away during their fierce battle. There are only a few seconds left until they make it to the top.

However, Gladiia slows down.

Specter:
Swordfish?

Gladiia:
We're almost done. Going by its size and weight, this should do the trick.

Gladiia:
Get ready.

Bishop:
How could this be...

Specter:
Now!

Specter:
This is payback for everything you've done to me...! You could say I've really gone easy on you!

Gladiia:
Don't let it get away.

Skadi:
We've made a pretty big ruckus already...

Skadi:
We'll let you off the hook for the other Hunters, bishop.

Skadi:
But this one strike is for my family and my friends, of both the sea and lands, all of whom you murdered.

Skadi:
Die, bastard.

Skadi:
Now die.
