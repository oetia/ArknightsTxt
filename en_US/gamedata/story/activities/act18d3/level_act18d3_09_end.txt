Gladiia:
It is leaking water everywhere. Let's finish it off. We need to go.

Bishop?:
Why do you blind philistines get to live, while I must fail when I have dedicated my entire life to this noble goal...?

Bishop?:
You are mere pets of Ægir! Blind and stagnant... You are nothing but a nuisance to science and to the future!

Bishop?:
I am... so close to the truth! Why must I die here while you... you get to escape the punishment you deserve?!

Bishop?:
I've come so far! My will and my flesh were on the verge of exceeding the limitations of man! Why?!

Bishop?:
Why? Why?! Why!!

Gladiia:
Shut up.

Bishop?:
......

Bishop?:
Ægir... will fall. Nothing will be left of you... Nothing...

Gladiia:
You fool. I'm Ægir. As long as I'm alive, Ægir is alive.

Bishop?:
You... But...

Bishop?:
Ironic... How ironic.

Bishop?:
You are different. Huff... You are destined to be different...

Bishop?:
You know it. Your destiny is all but set in stone.

Gladiia:
Enough of your nonsense. Just die already. That's the only thing I ask of you, and I'm being plenty sincere about this.

Bishop?:
Curse you... Curse you all... until the lands fall... You will flee the sea... only to find yourself dissolved in its waters like salt.

Bishop?:
On the barren wastelands lined with your corpses, our ceaseless waves will engulf all of the world's land!

Specter:
He is gone, at long last. This has finally come to an end... I ended it by my own hands... yet this is nowhere nearly as satisfying as I imagined.

Specter:
Compared to all they have done to me, this is far from enough, but that's one down, two to go for us.

Specter:
Ugh, I'm getting a little dizzy. How did I come to this place? It feels almost like a dream.

Skadi:
Shark?

Specter:
I can't... stay awake for long after all...

Gladiia:
We finally have their tentacles caught. If we grab it now and pluck its roots out there, we will definitely find a way to heal you.

Specter:
That isn't a big problem. As it stands, they cannot control me, and I feel exceptionally well. The feeling of freedom... Who could have known I would get to experience it now? This has me so elated, it feels as though I'm flying high with excitement.

Specter:
Though, Captain, I am afraid I heard everything you said.

Specter:
Was the bishop saying we will become Seaborns too? Captain, will you become one of those more formidable kinds? They are quite strong.

Skadi:
That won't happen.

Skadi:
You are way too different from them.

Gladiia:
I hope my actions didn't put you two in harm's way.

Skadi:
Answer a few questions for me.

Gladiia:
Ask away.

Skadi:
Is there Seaborn blood flowing in our veins?

Gladiia:
Yes.

Skadi:
You are here to figure out the cause of the problems in Specter's body, and you took that blow to figure out why the Seaborn was looking for me.

Gladiia:
Yes, that's right.

Skadi:
And you knew from the start the bishop wasn't the only Seaborn here?

Gladiia:
Yes.

Skadi:
Do you know what I did after that final battle that was borderline suicide?

Gladiia:
I don't.

Skadi:
Did we win?

Gladiia:
I don't know. I lost contact with Ægir.

Skadi:
Are we abandoned by Ægir...?

Gladiia:
We're not.

Skadi:
Okay, let's go.

Specter:
How snappy.

Skadi:
No reason to dawdle around. I'm an Abyssal Hunter.

Skadi:
Is it somehow different for you girls in your squad?

Gladiia:
All Abyssal Hunters are like that.

Skadi:
This place is about to collapse. Besides...

Specter:
There's too many of them.

Specter:
Skadi, I need you to apply yourself here! You are the only one whose arms and legs aren't all scrapped up!

Skadi:
What do you want me to do...? My hands are numb already. When was the last time you had to stick your hands into their mouths to tear them into two?

Gladiia:
About three seconds ago.

Gladiia:
Just now.

Skadi:
No, as long as its body is still there... there will be no end to the Sea Terrors. It's summoning them. It's an anchor!

Specter:
We'll need to destroy the body, then... Burying it won't quite be enough...

Gladiia:
I'll do it.

Specter:
When you have a huge hole in you?

Gladiia:
You two—

Kal'tsit:
Get moving, Hunters!

Skadi:
What are you doing there?!

Kal'tsit:
We'll talk later! Mon3tr, do it!
