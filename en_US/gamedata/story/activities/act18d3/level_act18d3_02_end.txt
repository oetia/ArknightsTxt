???:
...Gr—Greetings.

Skadi:
Hm? There's another one.

Female Inhabitant:
Don't—Don't hit me... I'm not very much like them. I know you're good.

Skadi:
You can understand what I mean.

Female Inhabitant:
You only came here following Bench.

Young Inhabitant:
*Whimper*... Woodframe, Woodframe...

Skadi:
He ran, I followed.

Female Inhabitant:
You bear no ill will towards us.

Skadi:
All I ask is he gives what's mine back.

Female Inhabitant:
Huh?

Female Inhabitant:
B—Bench... what did you take?

Young Inhabitant:
All shiny... all shiny... hard... it hurts... *whimper*...

Female Inhabitant:
That's not for you to eat! Pull it out of your mouth, quick!

Female Inhabitant:
I'm sorry, Bench tends to just grab at things he's never seen before. He doesn't understand these are things he shouldn't grab.

Skadi:
(Receives necklace)

Female Inhabitant:
Ugh, it's covered in spit... It's gotten your hand dirty.

Skadi:
It's fine, as long as I have it back.

Female Inhabitant:
We don't often see unfamiliar faces here. Did you come from the outside?

Skadi:
I came from a city elsewhere in Iberia.

Female Inhabitant:
It's very rare I see people from other places.

Female Inhabitant:
Your clothes... are very strange too. I've never seen material like this before. Does everyone from the outside dress that way?

Skadi:
Only wandering singers would.

Female Inhabitant:
Wandering... singers? I overheard you talking to Sheetmetal, but I don't know what that is.

Skadi:
Like me, they travel everywhere, occasionally stopping over, playing the harp, singing a song.

Female Inhabitant:
What about the case? What's inside it?

Skadi:
A saxophone.

Female Inhabitant:
What's a saxophone?

Skadi:
An instrument.

Female Inhabitant:
Are you really a wandering singer?

Skadi:
Mm.

Female Inhabitant:
(Quiet mutter)

Female Inhabitant:
So what did you come to do, then? Was it sing?

Skadi:
I came to find someone.

Female Inhabitant:
Who? Also a wandering singer?

Skadi:
Yes. She is a fellow of mine. We are colleagues.

Female Inhabitant:
Did she come to Sal Viento too?

Skadi:
Correct. Have you seen her?

Female Inhabitant:
You haven't told me what she looks like yet... oh, well! I said it just before, but you're the first time I've ever seen anyone like you.

Skadi:
I'll go and ask others. Can you guide me?

Female Inhabitant:
Guide? That trap... was my making. I thought you would've known.

Skadi:
I don't care.

Female Inhabitant:
You don't fault me? I thought you would at least have... reproached me some.

Skadi:
Let's go. I'm in a hurry.

Female Inhabitant:
Alright...

Skadi:
......

Female Inhabitant:
Agh!

Female Inhabitant:
Why—Why did you suddenly stop...? I knocked against your case. Ow...

Skadi:
I forgot to say. What's in my case is useless to you.

Skadi:
Apart from this, anything you might want, I can give you once you help me find her.

Female Inhabitant:
Er, I was only curious... Was I that apparent?

Skadi:
As plain to see as the trap you made.

Female Inhabitant:
Wow... singer, you not only have a pair of nimble hands, but a pair of formidable eyes too.

Inhabitant:
Ninety-eight...

Inhabitant:
Ninety-nine...

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
How do I ask questions here?

Female Inhabitant:
Huh? How do you usually ask them on the outside?

Skadi:
(With a thump, she sets down the case she was carrying.)

Skadi:
With this.

Female Inhabitant:
Um? The saxo... saxophone? You use instruments to ask questions?

Skadi:
Yes.

Skadi:
Slam slam, boom, kapow.

Female Inhabitant:
The sounds this instrument makes are quite bizarre.

Skadi:
It's very effective. They all usually open up straight away.

Skadi:
If they still don't talk, I can change angle, and go for another round.

Female Inhabitant:
Then I have a feeling that won't get you anywhere here.

Skadi:
Possibly.

Skadi:
(Strokes case)

Skadi:
In that case, the two just now. They already got talking.

Female Inhabitant:
Sheetmetal? They shouldn't even know of musical instruments. The people here usually keep themselves to themselves, and don't pay attention to anyone.

Female Inhabitant:
And they, er, talk very infrequently. Even if they knew, they wouldn't understand how to reply.

Skadi:
You've paid attention to me.

Female Inhabitant:
Probably because I'm a little odd. I'm not too like everyone else.

Skadi:
You talk a lot better than they do too.

Female Inhabitant:
Do I really? I'm so happy. It's all what Grandma Petra taught me.

Female Inhabitant:
Oh, if you want to find someone else to ask, I can bring you to Grandma Petra. She's the oldest one of us all here, and knows about the most too.

Skadi:
Alright.

Female Inhabitant:
Come, singer, let us walk through here.

Skadi:
Here?

Inhabitant:
Ninety-nine, ninety-nine...

Inhabitant:
Ninety-nine.

Female Inhabitant:
Do you mean them? You can ignore them, they're just standing around. They make it a bit of a squeeze, but it'll be alright even if you bump into them. They won't react, really. Will you, Tableleg?

Inhabitant:
......

Skadi:
......

Female Inhabitant:
Wha? She jumped—clear over their heads? H—How did she manage that? She didn't so much as touch anyone beneath her.

Female Inhabitant:
Do all people from the outside walk about like this? How magical!

Female Inhabitant:
Made it!

Female Inhabitant:
Grandma Petra! Graaaandmaaaa Petraaaa!

Old Inhabitant:
Don't shout! Are you trying to shake my ears apart?

Female Inhabitant:
Hee-hee, grandma, you're so very lively today! You're still—er, are you basking in the sun?

Old Inhabitant:
The sun... keh, where do you see the sun? I've been waiting all these years and I still haven't seen the sun. Anita, what are you getting up to? You're always scrambling about, doing this and that.

Old Inhabitant:
Around here, could anything important even happen?

Female Inhabitant:
Grandma Petra, I'm fine as I am. Someone else wanted to find you.

Female Inhabitant:
—Huh, where'd she go?

Skadi:
......

Female Inhabitant:
How did you get over here all of a sudden?

Skadi:
Someone's watching.

Female Inhabitant:
That so? Where? I can't see anyone around.

Skadi:
They're hiding very well. Not well enough, is all.

Female Inhabitant:
Why are you so grim? Aren't you a wandering singer? Shouldn't you be very used to people staring if you perform?

Skadi:
...You're right.

Female Inhabitant:
Then let's make our way over! Grandma Petra's in alright spirits. You might really be able to ask something or other.

Old Inhabitant:
Red sky at night, set aglow by my fiery clothes... beloved one, o, take me to fly o'er the deep blue ocean...

Female Inhabitant:
Grandma Petra, what are you doing now?

Old Inhabitant:
Anita, oh, curse you, Anita! Did you not see I was dancing?

Old Inhabitant:
When a young girl is dancing, nobody can disturb her. Are you going to dance along with me, Anita?

Female Inhabitant:
I... I don't know how.

Female Inhabitant:
Spin a little slower. Watch you don't make yourself dizzy again.

Old Inhabitant:
Nonsense! How would I go dizzy? I could round it ten and some times, and the whole city would clap for me!

Old Inhabitant:
I... *cough* *cough* *cough*...

Female Inhabitant:
Take a little break. Look, we have a wandering singer here. She has a question to ask you.

Old Inhabitant:
A wandering singer? I've never seen any wandering singer in my good long years.

Old Inhabitant:
This sunlight... this sunlight's carried on far too long. Why hasn't night come yet? Once the sun's turned in, there'll be people playing away in the bar... Will you be playing in there too?

Old Inhabitant:
We dance in the square, yes, right here we do... oh, I could spin more times than you could count. I have a red skirt, girlie, and I must say, it's much more beautiful than the one you're wearing.

Old Inhabitant:
So many youngsters want to dance with me. I like Manuel the most out of all of them. He was the most handsome when he was young.

Female Inhabitant:
Yes, Grandma Petra, you've told me this. You've told me plenty of times now.

Old Inhabitant:
Besides, who's looking for me?

Old Inhabitant:
Is it you? Your red dress is so pretty.

Old Inhabitant:
Red... no, I don't want... I don't want one red.

Old Inhabitant:
The seawater! The seawater is alive!

Female Inhabitant:
Oh, no, here it goes again...

Old Inhabitant:
...suddenly came washing up. Everyone dead! All so fine... so many fine people. The survivors had nothing either to eat.

Old Inhabitant:
Manuel... Manuel told me he'd take me with him. Then he went back on that. He said all those people who left had never come back. All of them had died on the outside.

Female Inhabitant:
You've told me this before as well.

Old Inhabitant:
And then he said he'd protect me. He promised me—he said he'd protect me! But he only wanted to make a fool of me—

Old Inhabitant:
He wanted to swindle me out of all the food I'd kept—*cough* *cough*, I pretended to agree, and I took the silver vase my mother left behind—*cough* *cough* *cough* *cough*—

Old Inhabitant:
Red... I like red... no, I don't want...

Female Inhabitant:
Grandma Petra, Grandma Petra! Just leave it, okay? You always get out of breath once you start going on about this.

Female Inhabitant:
The one I brought to see you today wanted to ask about something else.

Old Inhabitant:
Ask? Who's asking?

Female Inhabitant:
Her. A wandering singer from the outside.

Female Inhabitant:
Tell her who you're looking for, quickly! While Grandma Petra still has the strength to answer.

Skadi:
Hello—

Old Inhabitant:
Who're you?

Skadi:
A wandering singer. I'm searching for someone just like me, come from the outside as well.

Old Inhabitant:
An out—An outsider! You're pulling my leg!

Old Inhabitant:
No outsider would ever come around these parts, they stopped caring about us long ago...

Old Inhabitant:
You came to steal something, didn't you? You're going to steal my food, my clothes, you're going to sup on my flesh, drink my blood—

Old Inhabitant:
Monster! You're a monster!

Skadi:
(Frowns)

Female Inhabitant:
Grandma, there isn't a monster. She's just a wandering singer.

Old Inhabitant:
Red hem... red... I've found one, here... the singing has arisen... Manuel is waiting for me, I must go, I should go...

Old Inhabitant:
Beloved one, o, set aglow by my fiery clothes... fiery clothes...

Female Inhabitant:
*Sigh*.

Female Inhabitant:
I'm sorry, Grandma Petra's particularly worked up today. Maybe I shouldn't have brought you to see her.

Female Inhabitant:
I'll take her back inside, singer. Give me a moment.

Female Inhabitant:
Singer, are you still looking for the one watching you?

Skadi:
I'm fine.

Skadi:
Lurking trouble is like a beastling too scared to bare its fangs. No need to care.

Female Inhabitant:
Grandma Petra was...

Skadi:
She knows of playing instruments, and knows to dance. The way she spoke was akin to an outsider.

Female Inhabitant:
Really? No wonder. She speaks of so much, I can't make heads or tails of it.

Skadi:
She called me a monster.

Female Inhabitant:
She didn't mean to. Grandma often sees things that aren't real. It's like she's dreaming all the time.

Skadi:
Who isn't.

Female Inhabitant:
She's taken ill. She can't answer your question now.

Skadi:
A shame.

Female Inhabitant:
Don't be worried.

Female Inhabitant:
There are other brothers of mine where I live. I can take you to ask them in a while. I'm just not sure if they'll be willing to open up. Sometimes it really is so hard to speak with them.

Skadi:
Brothers?

Female Inhabitant:
Yes, brothers. You're an Iberian too. Don't you call them so?

Female Inhabitant:
My mother had no other children—but—I have very many brothers and sisters. In this town, we are all brothers and sisters. That's what the laws say.

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
And you believe in those.

Female Inhabitant:
What else would we do? When I was very young, Grandma Petra even told me that in those dark days past, we had made mistakes.

Female Inhabitant:
In those times, each one of us only looked after ourselves, hiding in each home, never speaking. Sometimes a can would be dug out, and we would, um, fight over it.

Female Inhabitant:
Then things gradually got better. Now we'll live together, and occasionally talk. Everyone's started to, erm—learn to share.

Female Inhabitant:
—'We want to survive, so we must love one another even more. For love is the inseparable bond between us. We may not steal, we may not fight.'

Female Inhabitant:
'Make oneself sturdy, but our whole self sturdier still. Only this way will bring a better life.'

Skadi:
This sounds familiar.

Female Inhabitant:
Really? The priest says everyone from the outside believes this too.

Female Inhabitant:
I forgot to say, the priest taught us this!

Female Inhabitant:
He'll tell us so much every time... most of it is lost on me. Apart from those few words just now, all I remember is we need to treat each other as brothers, and be a little kinder to each other. I suppose it is nice advice, isn't it?

Skadi:
Priest?

Female Inhabitant:
Yes. Just like you, he came from the outside too. Though that was very many years ago.

Female Inhabitant:
It was ever since he came that things improved. He's a brother among us.

Skadi:
Is he alone?

Female Inhabitant:
Most of the time he's alone. Oh, I heard from Sheetmetal's friends there was one more too, later on.

Skadi:
Who?

Female Inhabitant:
I've never seen her. She doesn't seem to show herself. Occasionally when the priest is speaking to us, she'll be standing behind him. I only ever see that one glimpse of her from far away.

Skadi:
Alright.

Female Inhabitant:
Why are you... in such a hurry suddenly? Do you need to go somewhere?

Skadi:
I'm going to the chapel.

Female Inhabitant:
Do you know how to get there?

Skadi:
Your chapel isn't that hard to recognize.

Female Inhabitant:
The way there's not so easy. You need to follow the coast from here. Come, let me show you.

Female Inhabitant:
Why did you stop?

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
So they followed.

Female Inhabitant:
What do you mean? You've lost me again.

Skadi:
That clingy beastling.

Female Inhabitant:
That's strange. You keep saying beastling—that should be an animal, right? We've got no animals living here—they disappeared long ago!

Skadi:
It's fine. Let's keep going.

Female Inhabitant:
Very well, friend from the outside. You're in charge.

Female Inhabitant:
What did you see? It's right there.

Female Inhabitant:
But we don't usually go to the chapel at this time.

Skadi:
I have ways in.

Female Inhabitant:
You can enter, we all can. The chapel's entrance is forever open to the devout—the priest said so. But... you wanted to seek someone out, didn't you?

Female Inhabitant:
He isn't usually in the chapel at this time.

Skadi:
What times is he in?

Female Inhabitant:
Every so often, he'll appear before us of his own accord, and make friendly conversation with every one of us.

Female Inhabitant:
If you have any issues, those are also times you can go find him. No matter what it is that bothers you, he'll never reject you.

Female Inhabitant:
On such days, until the sun rises the next morning, he'll be in the chapel waiting.

Female Inhabitant:
That's right, he can also help you in your search! I'm sure the priest would know much more than any of us!

Skadi:
How long is 'every so often?'

Female Inhabitant:
Um, I haven't seen him in the recent while. I'm not like them—I don't really count the days. But it should be the next two days? All our food is about to run bare.

Skadi:
Alright.

Female Inhabitant:
Strange. Whenever you say alright, I always feel like it isn't a sincere reply.

Female Inhabitant:
No, that's wrong of me. The priest said, we shouldn't doubt others. Ugh, they all say I'm so fond of thinking of all these questions, and it won't help me lead a good life in any way.

Skadi:
Were those also his words?

Female Inhabitant:
Haha, he'd never tell me this. I'd slip off before he knew it.

Female Inhabitant:
It's Sheetmetal and his lot, they all hate me making a racket. And it's not like I'm always itching to say so much. The people here are all too quiet.

Female Inhabitant:
Whenever they won't talk, I get so bored, and the only thing I can do is talk to myself for hours on end.

Female Inhabitant:
It used to be that only Grandma Petra would talk with me. And now you too, thank goodness. Oh, no. Do you think I'm annoying as well?

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
Where I come from, there are many who love speaking more than you do.

Female Inhabitant:
It sounds like a wonderful place!

Skadi:
...It's okay enough.

Female Inhabitant:
Where you come from, do the people dance? Just like Grandma Petra was mentioning, dancing in the square?

Skadi:
Occasionally.

Female Inhabitant:
Then why haven't I seen you dancing? I've noticed your harp.

Female Inhabitant:
Grandma Petra's told me. Don't you all dance around while you sing?

Skadi:
My dance... none of you may see.

Female Inhabitant:
Why?

Skadi:
The time, the place, and those before me are all not right.

Female Inhabitant:
You're so strange, practically stranger than me. Just where is your home? Are all the people where you're from as strange as you?

Skadi:
(Plucks strings)

Skadi:
Where I'm from, there is no home.

Skadi:
And I do not know where my home is. My home is long gone.

Female Inhabitant:
Well, that's okay. My home was long gone as well, years ago in a gale, when the building collapsed. My mamá was inside when it happened, and she's gone too.

Skadi:
......

Female Inhabitant:
But that's okay. Everyone's in the same boat. If your house is gone, find another empty one and move in. Plenty of buildings fit the bill here.

Female Inhabitant:
That's right, if you're not happy dancing, then can you sing for me?

Female Inhabitant:
I've never heard anyone else sing before.

Skadi:
Maybe.

Female Inhabitant:
Wonderful!

Female Inhabitant:
Oh, visiting so many places has gotten me hungry.

Female Inhabitant:
You're hungry too, aren't you? If you're hungry, you can't sing, right?

Female Inhabitant:
Let's go find something to eat.

Skadi:
Um...

Female Inhabitant:
Am I running too fast? I forgot you wouldn't know the way.

Female Inhabitant:
Right, I'm Anita! You can just shout my name from now on, and that way you won't be left behind. Call for me, and I'll stop and wait for you.
