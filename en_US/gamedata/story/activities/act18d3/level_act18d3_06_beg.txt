???:
There is no end... The fog is everywhere...

Anita:
Hm...♪

Skadi:
Uhh...

Anita:
Singer, you're awake! Good morning!

Skadi:
Was someone just singing?

Anita:
I-Is this a song? I don't know how to sing, but you were humming this while you were asleep.

Skadi:
I...

Anita:
Ow! Singer... You are grabbing too hard...

Skadi:
You...

Skadi:
Mother...

Skadi:
Monsters...

Skadi:
Monsters.

Skadi:
Monsters!

Anita:
Ah!

Anita:
*cough*... Singer, your box... It's really hurting my chest when you press it against me...

Skadi:
I...

Anita:
A-Are you letting go? That really scared me...

Anita:
Singer, I thought you were going to kill me.

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
If I were going to kill you, I could've done that easily.

Anita:
But you don't want to kill me.

Skadi:
You can tell?

Anita:
I can tell.

Skadi:
But I don't know.

Anita:
Eh?

Anita:
R-Running out again...? Singer, where are you going?!

Inquisitor:
Sir... The tides are rising again.

Inquisitor:
The colors of the sea... That patch of color has changed.

Inquisitor:
What is there in the water? I-Is it shells and finfish? Why would they suddenly show up in the water? And why are they growing closer and closer to the shore?

High Inquisitor:
From far deeper places, they made their way here by following currents that normally would not exist.

Inquisitor:
What?!

Inquisitor:
I thought... the reason they headed into the sea, claiming it would get them food, was some absurd, unfounded belief. I thought, in their despair, they were fooled into doing this...

Inquisitor:
But I never imagined... they are actually dealing with the sea? They are using their own men as fodder to feed the monsters of the sea, and the monsters then also feed them in return?

Inquisitor:
This mutualism is horrifying... and wretched...! No wonder there are so many Sea Terrors here!

Inquisitor:
But I thought I put an end to it yesterday...!

High Inquisitor:
Not all corrections are fruitful. This is something you must understand.

Inquisitor:
I...

Inquisitor:
Am I in the wrong, High Inquisitor? I just wanted to save them.

High Inquisitor:
To right a wrong, you either bring what strayed from righteousness back onto the right path—

Inquisitor:
But... What do the people here even see as right?

Inquisitor:
You can't grow any food in the lands and seas of Sal Viento anymore.

Inquisitor:
This was a foregone conclusion decades ago, and to fight it would be futile. The nomadic city, the society, and the people who live in it... They are all slowly marching towards their death.

Inquisitor:
They asked me... If... If there isn't a way out... How are they supposed to see right from wrong?

High Inquisitor:
—Or perhaps make that which is wrong no more.

Inquisitor:
Sir...! You don't mean...

High Inquisitor:
You are doubting me.

Inquisitor:
I... No, of course not. I just...

Inquisitor:
They may have turned out like this... but they were once Iberian citizens. I want to protect them, and I hope I can help these inhabitants... so that they can make our country a better place.

High Inquisitor:
You should have doubts.

Inquisitor:
Huh?

High Inquisitor:
In making a judgment, rely on no one but yourself!

Inquisitor:
Yes, sir...

High Inquisitor:
Look out at the sea. What do you see?

Inquisitor:
I see... a threat.

High Inquisitor:
Don't regurgitate your memorized answers.

Inquisitor:
Yes, sir!

Inquisitor:
The sea... is flowing. It's ever changing.

High Inquisitor:
Remember everything that you see.

High Inquisitor:
Change has happened, is happening, and will happen. If you can't see it clearly for yourself, you will find yourself lost.

Inquisitor:
Sir, what is that under your feet?!

High Inquisitor:
What do you think?

Inquisitor:
A Sea Terror... Did we miss one when they attacked last night?! No, doesn't seem like it... This one wandered off the beach... It looks like it's climbed a long way... It's not quite the same...

Inquisitor:
I... uh... I should know this...

High Inquisitor:
This is an evil that must be eradicated.

Inquisitor:
I get it... I can see it... It's the whole truth of this deal of theirs.

Inquisitor:
So this is what becomes of anyone who wanders into the sea... This is not just the monsters' nest. It's their breeding ground.

Inquisitor:
Uhh...

Inquisitor:
Doesn't that mean that all the people here will become monsters?!

Inquisitor:
......

Inquisitor:
(Grips scabbard)

Inquisitor:
High Inquisitor, I need to head back to the city.

Anita:
*pant*... *pant*... Phew... S-Singer, you're too fast...

Skadi:
But not fast enough.

Anita:
Huh?

Skadi:
You managed to follow me again.

Anita:
H-Haha... Singer, this is my home... I know this place much better than you.

Skadi:
I should leave.

Anita:
Leave? What do you mean?

Skadi:
I mean leave this place.

Anita:
Huh? Did you figure out where to go to find your friend?

Skadi:
At the very least... I should keep my distance from you.

Anita:
Huh? Why's that?

Skadi:
The Inquisitor was right about one thing.

Anita:
She talked about a lot of things...

Skadi:
I am a danger to all of you.

Anita:
Because of what happened last night? You saved us, Singer. We are very thankful of what you did for us.

Skadi:
I saved you? Is that what you think?

Skadi:
If I'd missed even one of the Sea Terrors, it could've torn you to pieces as it marched on.

Skadi:
You would've been killed.

Skadi:
I brought it here. Therefore, I killed you.

Anita:
No, that's not how it is...

Skadi:
How is it not? This has happened before.

Skadi:
They died because of me. They despised me, they were scared of me, and they blamed me for it.

Anita:
They... They were wrong!

Anita:
You didn't mean to do that.

Skadi:
I didn't mean to?

Skadi:
I don't know.

Anita:
Uhh...

Skadi:
After all that, I'm not sure... anymore.

Skadi:
I thought that if I killed it, I would find the answer.

Anita:
Singer...? You don't look so good.

Anita:
You are hurt, and you spent so much of your energy. You haven't completely recovered yet, have you?

Anita:
You should come back with me and get some rest. You will feel much better once you get more sleep.

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
Why aren't you afraid of me?

Anita:
Hm?

Skadi:
Your grandmother called me a monster, while your friends all looked at me with animosity.

Skadi:
These kinds of gazes are everywhere... I got used to them long ago.

Skadi:
But what about you? When you look at me, what do you see?

Anita:
You... You are a singer.

Skadi:
A singer. That's what I told you, and you believed it. That Inquisitor, on the other hand, did not. If I tell you I'm a monster now, will you believe me?

Anita:
I won't...

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
Why are you always following me?

Anita:
Huh?

Skadi:
Anything that I can give you, you are free to take, yet you don't want them.

Skadi:
You don't want to kill me either.

Anita:
K-Kill you? No, Singer, why would I want to kill you?

Skadi:
When I do something for you, you pay me something in return. It's always either that or the other way around.

Skadi:
Whenever you exchange something, there exists a promise. It's only when promises exist that there's trust.

Anita:
Promise?

Skadi:
You don't know what that is.

Anita:
(Shakes head)

Skadi:
Listen up. You helped me, so I will give you what you want. This is what a promise is.

Anita:
I don't want anything...

Skadi:
You are lying.

Skadi:
I can smell as much with my nose as my eyes can see.

Anita:
Uhh...

Skadi:
You told me this is your home, and that's how you know how to find me so quickly. That's a lie too.

Skadi:
If you don't tell me the truth, I can't trust you.

Anita:
No, Singer, don't go!

Anita:
It's not that I'm not telling the truth. I just... don't understand.

Anita:
Singer, to all of us... To me, you are still a mystery. You came from the outside, and I've never met anyone like you...

Anita:
You want to know how I guessed that you are here. It's not that I'm trying to lie. I'm just... embarrassed.

Anita:
This is... the outskirts. It's as far as it gets from the city.

Anita:
I know that you are hiding from us, and I thought this is where you would probably come too if you wanted to run away.

Skadi:
'Too?'

Anita:
I come here often myself. Of course, I don't tell Sheetmetal or anyone. They aren't happy when they find me running this far away.

Anita:
Look at that chunk over there. It's tall. I climb on there sometimes. The stronger the wind gets, the farther I can see.

Skadi:
You are curious about what's outside.

Anita:
I don't know. I... I sometimes wonder about how it's like outside. It's pretty pointless, I know, and they kept telling me that too, so all I do is imagine it all by myself here.

Anita:
This is the furthest I've gone whenever I go outside to scavenge. Outside... There's nothing useful outside.

Skadi:
If you're curious about what's outside, you just have to walk a little further.

Anita:
I used to go to the west side. Sheetmetal would warn me that there were monsters outside, and we would die if we ever stepped out.

Anita:
Singer, you are from the outside. I am following you around because I have lots and lots of questions... I want to know if what Sheetmetal said is actually true.

Skadi:
Perhaps.

Skadi:
If you head outside, you will die.

Anita:
Phew... so it's true...

Skadi:
You aren't disappointed.

Anita:
Singer, if I have the chance, I think I want to see it for myself.

Anita:
It doesn't matter if there are monsters there... I don't think I'm scared of them.

Skadi:
Hm?

Anita:
The Inquisitor said I'm not afraid of monsters because I don't know what they would do to me.

Anita:
I think she's right about that.

Skadi:
She made that up.

Anita:
*cough*, *cough*...

Skadi:
I'm not afraid of them either.

Anita:
Haha... That's gotta be because you know the monsters can't do anything to you.

Anita:
Not like me. Last night was the first time I got a good look of those monsters. I didn't know what was going to happen to me. My heart was racing like never before.

Anita:
Then, when I woke up this morning, the weather felt so much better than I've ever experienced. I could feel the wind, and I could see the sea waves splashing ever closer.

Anita:
This day has been different than all the other days I've lived, because I don't know what's going to happen.

Skadi:
Sounds like you're excited.

Anita:
Excited?

Skadi:
Fear and excitement are pretty much the same. Both get your heart racing and your blood flowing.

Anita:
Am I sick?

Skadi:
You are not sick. To some people out there, this is what it means to be alive.

Anita:
I didn't know it feels this good to be alive. Is it like this outside every day?

Skadi:
It must feel better than here.

Anita:
Can I really go outside...?

Anita:
My box... Once my box is full.

Anita:
I need to... get more food. I need to make sure Grandma Petra's all set.

Anita:
I... Argh!

Skadi:
The monsters will eat you if you're so careless.

Anita:
Singer... you saved me again.

Skadi:
And you could've saved me the trouble if you didn't come.

Anita:
Haha... S-Sorry...

Anita:
Huh? Huh?

Anita:
My leg... Something's grabbing my leg.

Anita:
It's slippery... and heavy!

Skadi:
There they are again... Everywhere, too. What a pain.

Anita:
Ugh... Singer, I-I'm losing my grip...

Skadi:
Close your eyes.

Anita:
Hm?

Skadi:
And then let go.

Anita:
Can I really...?

Skadi:
You can either believe me or not. The choice is yours.
