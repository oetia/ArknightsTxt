Inquisitor:
D-Did you see that just now?

Anita:
I saw all of it.

Inquisitor:
How did she even do that?

Anita:
She is a singer...

Anita:
Inquisitor, this is nothing strange for her. That's something she's always been capable of.

Inquisitor:
Singer... what? You're still calling her by that name?

Anita:
How else should I call her? You're the Inquisitor. You tell me.

Inquisitor:
......

Inquisitor:
I need to go outside.

Anita:
Hey, wait!

Inquisitor:
What are you doing? So you think you can stop me too? I am an Inquisitor!

Inquisitor:
What is this... So slimy...

Anita:
Phew... I-I got it! I landed a blow! That was close, Inquisitor.

Anita:
Thank goodness you smashed this chair to pieces. It gave me a weapon when I needed one to smack this thing. It would've climbed on top of you otherwise!

Inquisitor:
Y-You...! All of you are out of your minds!

Inquisitor:
How could you not be scared, seeing these things?

Anita:
I was. Just a little. They're not as scary as you, though.

Inquisitor:
You... How dare you compare me to these monsters?!

Inquisitor:
Fine, I won't argue with you. You haven't seen them before, and you have no idea what they are capable of. It's no wonder you are not scared.

Inquisitor:
Wait, the other inhabitants are coming outside. They... What are they doing?!

Inquisitor:
They're not scared at all either...

Inquisitor:
The problem...

Inquisitor:
I need to find where this problem lies...

Male Inhabitant C:
......

Male Inhabitant D:
Sand.

Male Inhabitant C:
Salt... So salty.

Male Inhabitant D:
That thing just now. You can eat it. It's gone. A shame.

Male Inhabitant C:
Too bad.

Male Inhabitant D:
You can eat salt.

Male Inhabitant C:
Yes, it's edible.

Male Inhabitant D:
More. More... Mhmm, blurgh.

Male Inhabitant C:
It's dirty.

Male Inhabitant D:
Swallow it. More...

Inquisitor:
Stop right there!

Skadi:
......

Inquisitor:
I still have questions for you, and you will answer them—What do you mean, they're here for you?

Skadi:
I'm bleeding.

Inquisitor:
I can tell that much. You were wounded in your fight with the High Inquisitor, so you ran away. How's that got anything to do with these... monsters showing up?

Skadi:
They can smell my blood.

Inquisitor:
They're here to... kill you? I saw them all dashing toward you—

Skadi:
Perhaps.

Inquisitor:
Perhaps?

Skadi:
They can't hurt me.

Inquisitor:
Y-You! Do you know how annoying the way you talk is?

Skadi:
It's the truth.

Inquisitor:
They—I mean these monsters—They're gone.

Skadi:
Yes.

Inquisitor:
They're all gone without a trace, as if they never were. If I didn't see them clearly with my own eyes, I would've thought this all a dream.

Inquisitor:
These monsters... the Sea Terrors. I've come across them plenty of times before. They don't look that much like these ones, but they have that same disgusting stench.

Inquisitor:
But that was on the beach, and they never show up in such numbers. Do you mean to tell me they do not actually live in the sea?

Inquisitor:
They only show up when someone goes look for trouble at the shore, right? Just like what you were doing during the day.

Inquisitor:
And now they came this far away from the beach. They've nearly made it to the streets.

Skadi:
They can make it far more places than you can imagine. They can spread by changing form, permeating every corner of the world.

Skadi:
Be it iron-forged cities, villages built atop the highlands, or barrenlands with nothing but sand. Wherever one can go, they can too.

Inquisitor:
How is that possible?!

Skadi:
The world is surrounded by ocean. Just because you cannot see the ocean does not mean that the land where you stand will forever remain untouched by its waters. The seas are alive and ever flowing, and so are the calamities they bring with them.

Inquisitor:
I know there are places where the seas are dangerous, but I didn't know that the danger existed... in the lands outside Iberia too.

Skadi:
Danger exists everywhere.

Skadi:
Still, these calamities are here because of me. If you come any closer, you will be affected too.

Inquisitor:
You... Just who are you?!

Skadi:
I already told you.

Inquisitor:
Enough with the wandering singer thing! I saw it all.

Inquisitor:
You were fighting them, and you know exactly how to fight them too.

Inquisitor:
When you finished them off, your technique was so much better than when you were fighting the High Inquisitor and me.

Skadi:
I don't have quite the same handle on fighting humans.

Inquisitor:
A-Ahem... Let's dispense with the strange talk... I know you are a strange one, but still...

Inquisitor:
Were you... a hunter? I can kind of see that in your eyes.

Skadi:
If you think I am, then sure.

Inquisitor:
And you hunted these... Sea Terrors before?

Skadi:
They need to be eliminated.

Inquisitor:
Ugh... The way you talk just grates me so much, but—I don't even know why—coming from you, this doesn't sound like a lie at all.

Inquisitor:
Singer, hunter... It doesn't matter to me what you were.

Inquisitor:
Going by the circumstances, I suppose you saved not just my life, but everyone who lives on this street, maybe even the entire town.

Inquisitor:
You may be the enemy of my enemy, but that does not make you a friend.

Inquisitor:
No matter the case, I need to do my job. I have to take you away.

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
You were asking me what I am doing here.

Skadi:
I am here to seek an answer, and this answer only has to do with me... and the person I am looking for.

Inquisitor:
You wouldn't tell me a thing earlier.

Skadi:
You didn't give me a chance to tell you.

Inquisitor:
......

Inquisitor:
You may have given me an answer now, but that doesn't mean my judgment has changed.

Inquisitor:
You don't belong to this city. A person like you showing up is a mistake.

Inquisitor:
Not to mention... You told me yourself you brought this disaster with you.

Inquisitor:
—It's certainly not how I imagined it, though.

Inquisitor:
Nonetheless, Ægir. You are dangerous. You are a danger to this city. At the same time, this city is also a danger to you.

Skadi:
Hm?

Inquisitor:
Look at them. They are... eating scraps of the Sea Terrors' remains. They don't fear these monsters... No, they don't even know what monsters are.

Inquisitor:
They feed when they are hungry. As a monster does. And humans... humans know what fear is.

Inquisitor:
So... Are they still human?

Skadi:
All I know is that they're trying their best to live.

Skadi:
From that perspective, there's nothing that sets humans and monsters apart.

Inquisitor:
When they live like that... can you really say they are alive?

Inquisitor:
The High Inquisitor told me to see it for myself, and only now do I understand what he meant.

Inquisitor:
In this city, the biggest problem isn't whatever its citizens are doing. It's that they are still alive in this manner—This is the most abnormal thing of all.

Inquisitor:
Like you, they are dangerous, and this danger must be kept under control, just like how mistakes must be corrected.

Skadi:
You haven't given up.

Inquisitor:
Now I really can't let you go.

Skadi:
I already told you. I still have something to take care of, and I am in a hurry.

Inquisitor:
Looks like we will have to do this again, then.

Inquisitor:
Ægir, I know you are hurt, and you must be exhausted after fighting the Sea Terrors.

Inquisitor:
But I will not go easy on you.

Inquisitor:
What's this? A small shell?

Inquisitor:
It wasn't you, Ægir... You wouldn't throw this at me.

Inquisitor:
Perhaps one of the locals vomiting their guts out on the floor? No, it can't be them. They don't even know what it is they are stuffing into their mouths. They wouldn't move against me.

Inquisitor:
Is it... from the window over to the side?

Inquisitor:
......

Inquisitor:
Who is it?!

Inquisitor:
Who threw this? Step forward!

Anita:
Hahh...

Inquisitor:
You? Did you throw this at me? Are you still trying to get in my way, to protect this Ægir?

Anita:
Uh, yes! It's me!

Old Inhabitant:
Anita, stop it with your nonsense.

Anita:
Grandma Petra?! Y-You should stay inside...

Old Inhabitant:
I did it, Your Honor.

Inquisitor:
Did you just call me 'Your Honor?'

Old Inhabitant:
I know who exactly you are. These ones know nothing.

Inquisitor:
There's someone still sane here...?

Inquisitor:
Old woman, perhaps your eyes aren't as good as they used to be. Please step back. We are taking care of something dangerous here.

Old Inhabitant:
Look, Your Honor. My eyes are as perfect as they can be. Even if the sky's pitch black, I will have no trouble hitting you as long as you forget to dodge.

Old Inhabitant:
Oh, tiny seashells, beautiful waves♪

Old Inhabitant:
One shell after another, one beating wave after another...

Inquisitor:
You admitted it yourself. Now I must—

Anita:
Inquisitor... Your Honor! Grandma Petra's sick... Please don't blame her?

Inquisitor:
She's sick? No wonder. Yes, I can see that.

Old Inhabitant:
Oh, Little Anita. Enough nonsense. How am I sick?

Anita:
Grandma Petra, please stop. Please.

Old Inhabitant:
Sick... sick!

Old Inhabitant:
What's sick is Sal Viento itself! Yes—This place, and all its people! And you, almighty Inquisitor... You are sick as well!

Inquisitor:
You, take your senile grandmother home.

Inquisitor:
I have more important things to deal with.

Old Inhabitant:
What important things? What's more important than being alive?

Inquisitor:
As an Inquisitor, there are things that I have to safeguard even with my life. For example, all the things that the law says are correct... as well as our country itself.

Old Inhabitant:
You will use your life... to safeguard whose life?

Inquisitor:
I... Whatever... I shouldn't waste any more of my time with you. Your old age and your illness have done a number on your faculties, citizen. I can overlook your crazy behavior so long as you stand aside and let me take care of what's important.

Old Inhabitant:
Your Honor, I'm afraid I don't understand this right or wrong, this country of yours.

Old Inhabitant:
I just want to ask you this. This thing you are trying to uphold. We were never part of it, isn't that right?

Inquisitor:
What...?!

Old Inhabitant:
You Inquisitors took our people away. You said they were disrupting order, that they assaulted someone while they were stealing food. They just wanted to live.

Inquisitor:
That wasn't me... but if they committed a crime, then that's how it should be.

Old Inhabitant:
And they've never been back.

Old Inhabitant:
You brought your bad guys away, but did that improve our lives?

Inquisitor:
When you remove all the factors that bring chaos to society in time, there will naturally be order.

Old Inhabitant:
Yet there is less and less food to go by... Those of us who got on in years either die of hunger or disease. Even some of our young couldn't endure.

Old Inhabitant:
You speak of order... but all you want is for us to die quietly, isn't it? That way, there will be no more noise, and you upper class folks can finally lie down on your fluffy beds for a quiet night of sleep.

Inquisitor:
That's not it.

Inquisitor:
All of Iberia is suffering. Not just you.

Inquisitor:
Shouldn't a criminal who steals resources and harms the people be stopped? Suppose there are ten meals before us. They should feed ten Iberians.

Inquisitor:
If no one is there to tell them how much they should get, they will fight to no end. In the end, only one of the ten will remain.

Inquisitor:
The Inquisition draws the boundary of right and wrong amid this chaos and guides the masses to the right path. Otherwise the whole country would've long become a heap of sand.

Old Inhabitant:
Everything you said... I don't get it, and it's nothing I can see.

Old Inhabitant:
We don't have a way out. When we truly wanted one, where were you?

Inquisitor:
I... I want to help you. I am working hard to become a full-fledged Inquisitor. I took this path because I want to help the people, and I trust that this is the only way.

Old Inhabitant:
Help us...?

Old Inhabitant:
I hoped, imagined, thirsted, even dreamt of someone coming to save us. I screamed through so many nights till my throat was hoarse.

Old Inhabitant:
You never came.

Old Inhabitant:
Will you Inquisitors only come when someone has done something wrong?

Old Inhabitant:
Look at these old bones. I never imagined I'd live this long. What a tragedy. Every day is filled with nothing but pain.

Old Inhabitant:
Look, I'm attacking you, Your Honor.

Old Inhabitant:
Take me away! Take me, and end me! Put me out of my misery!

Old Inhabitant:
Hurry, do it! I can't wait no longer—I've waited all these years! *Cough* *cough*...

Inquisitor:
I...

Inquisitor:
I don't want to fight you. Your anger... is understandable. My sword should not...

Inquisitor:
Don't force my hand, citizen.

Old Inhabitant:
*Cough* *Cough*...

Anita:
Grandma!

Old Inhabitant:
Oh... Anita... You came to the plaza too.

Old Inhabitant:
It's dark... Why is there no singing yet?

Old Inhabitant:
Singer, you said you are a singer. Why aren't you singing? Where is your harp? I want to dance. I need a tune.

Skadi:
......

Old Inhabitant:
Look, Your Honor. You're more useless than a wandering singer. She sings for us. She's even brave enough... to stand in front of the rest of us.

Old Inhabitant:
I'm not scared of monsters, and I'm not scared of death. What I am scared of is this life. Am I crazy, Anita?

Anita:
Grandma, it's okay. You're shaking. It's cold here. Why don't we go back? Lie down and get some rest. You'll feel better.

Old Inhabitant:
Okay... Okay. Let's go. We'll go home. It isn't like I know where else to go anyway.

Inquisitor:
You...!

Old Inhabitant:
Did you change your mind? If you changed your mind, you can still take me away. That, or kill me. At the very least... I would get to die like a person.

Old Inhabitant:
Do it while I'm still alive, Your Honor. I don't have much time left.

Old Inhabitant:
Come, let's go... Singer, come with us. I want to hear you sing.

Inquisitor:
......

Inquisitor:
I will let you go... for now.

Inquisitor:
But I will be back!

Inquisitor:
And you, Ægir! I'm watching you, and I will get to the end of this! Don't think you can get out of this one!

Anita:
Phew... That was close.

Anita:
Singer, are you okay? You look white as a sheet.

Skadi:
I'm fine.

Anita:
You don't need to act so tough anymore. The Inquisitor is gone.

Skadi:
I'm not afraid of her.

Anita:
I know. I can tell you aren't afraid. What would someone like you be afraid of?

Skadi:
She's not a bad person.

Skadi:
And it would be a good thing for you if I leave this place.

Anita:
A good thing? There's nothing good here.

Anita:
Grandma might've said all that, but she doesn't really hate the Inquisitor. She hates something else. I know it.

Old Inhabitant:
Now dance. Haha, I love your singing...

Anita:
Stop spinning around, Grandma. You're tired. The singer will sing for you. Isn't that right?

Skadi:
......

Anita:
Give me your hand, singer. Let me take a look at your wound.

Skadi:
No...

Anita:
I can't come near you because it's dangerous, right?

Anita:
It's okay. I trust you. If anything happens, you will win.

Skadi:
......

Anita:
Look, your wounds aren't so bad at all. No more bleeding.

Anita:
Singer, you are amazing. You heal up so quickly.

Skadi:
It could've been quicker.

Anita:
But even so, you don't look well to me, and the house you picked was blown to pieces. I doubt even you can get a good sleep there now. Why don't you come home with me and Grandma Petra?

Old Inhabitant:
That's right. Stay with us. Don't let them come look for any more trouble with you.

Skadi:
No...

Anita:
Okay, enough 'No's, 'No need's, and 'I have other things to do.' I am sick of them.

Skadi:
I can still...

Skadi:
Ugh...

Anita:
Look at you. Out of strength, no? You need someone to look after you, and you definitely need some sleep.

Anita:
I also think the person you're looking for probably doesn't want to see you pushing yourself like this.

Skadi:
......

Male Inhabitant A:
What was that... just now?

Male Inhabitant A:
None of my business anymore...

Male Inhabitant A:
I shouldn't ask questions. I have my answer now. I know the way. I know where to go.

Male Inhabitant A:
I need to go straight... Straight ahead.

Male Inhabitant A:
Tomorrow, everyone will have food to eat. I... No, we... All of us will get to live.

Male Inhabitant A:
'We want to survive, so we must love one another even more.'

Male Inhabitant A:
'For love is the inseparable bond between us.'

Male Inhabitant A:
'I will become stronger.'

Male Inhabitant A:
'Our people will likewise become stronger.'

Male Inhabitant A:
......

Male Inhabitant A:
This...

Male Inhabitant A:
Her harp. It's here.

Male Inhabitant A:
(Tries to play the harp like Skadi does)

Male Inhabitant A:
(Chords)

Male Inhabitant A:
Sounds horrible.

Male Inhabitant A:
This is useless. I will leave it here to rot.
