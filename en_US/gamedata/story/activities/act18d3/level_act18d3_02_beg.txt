Iberia, Sal Viento

Skadi:
This is the place on the map.

Skadi:
I can't say it smells any good.

Skadi:
Hello.

Male Inhabitant:
......

Skadi:
May I ask—

Another Male Inhabitant:
(He hangs his head low, and does not speak.)

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
Monsters?

Skadi:
They're all humans.

Skadi:
(She utters Iberian.)

Skadi:
Is this not how they speak anymore?

Skadi:
(Iberian again, the accent somewhat changed.)

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
Moreover, I'm a singer right now.

Skadi:
A singer doesn't do that. Mister José said so.

???:
Ninety-nine...

Skadi:
Someone's talking.

???:
Ninety-nine.

Skadi:
A... child? He's mumbling a number.

Skadi:
I can't have misheard.

Skadi:
You—

Skadi:
My necklace just...

Skadi:
You will not escape!

Young Inhabitant:
Ninety-nine, ninety-nine...

Skadi:
You can't run.

Young Inhabitant:
*Whimper*...

Skadi:
Why take what's mine? Why bring me here?

Skadi:
Hm?

Skadi:
A hole, a few ropes. The ambushes outside were at least much more adequate than this.

Skadi:
Come out, all of you.

Skadi:
I needed to find you, anyway. Quickly, if you don't mind.

Male Inhabitant A:
She's very peculiar.

Male Inhabitant B:
Quite, Sheetmetal. Such a person, I've never before seen.

Male Inhabitant A:
Nor I.

Skadi:
So you know how to speak after all.

Male Inhabitant A:
Who are you?

Skadi:
A wandering singer.

Male Inhabitant A:
I know not what a wandering singer is.

Male Inhabitant B:
Sheetmetal, do not speak to her.

Male Inhabitant A:
Your face, unfamiliar. Your attire, strange. You are not one from here. What is your business?

Skadi:
I want to ask a question.

Male Inhabitant A:
Your clothes, very new.

Skadi:
Have you seen my fellow person?

Male Inhabitant A:
You have much strength. You are able to eat your fill.

Skadi:
She came here before I did.

Male Inhabitant A:
Your case, very heavy.

Skadi:
An instrument is not a light thing.

Male Inhabitant A:
The thing in your grasp, very uncanny.

Skadi:
I assume your harps should come more or less the same.

Skadi:
(Plucks strings)

Male Inhabitant A:
Ears, pained. It is a weapon.

Skadi:
It is able to not be.

Male Inhabitant B:
Sheetmetal, this person, uncanny. Do not heed her. To speak, very tiring.

Male Inhabitant A:
Bench. Let go of him.

Skadi:
Bench... Do you mean this child?

Skadi:
I didn't intend anything for him. He took something of mine. Things like that are significant.

Male Inhabitant A:
You came to rob something.

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
I'm only taking back what's mine. And looking for someone who can understand me when I talk.

Young Inhabitant:
*Whimper*...

Male Inhabitant A:
Our child, you may not touch.

Male Inhabitant A:
Our things, you may not rob.

Skadi:
Hm?

Male Inhabitant A:
Our rules, may not be broken.

Male Inhabitant B:
Sheetmetal, you have gotten nearer. What are you doing?

Male Inhabitant A:
She is going to harm our child, steal what is ours, break our rules.

Male Inhabitant B:
Is she not our sister? If she is, she too has a share.

Male Inhabitant A:
She is surely not.

Skadi:
You don't understand me.

Skadi:
I'll go and ask someone else.

Male Inhabitant A:
You may not leave.

Male Inhabitant B:
One moment, Sheetmetal...

Male Inhabitant B:
Ouch!

Male Inhabitant B:
There—There is a hole here.

Male Inhabitant A:
Woodframe's hole. You forgot.

Skadi:
Oh, it comes in handy after all.

Male Inhabitant A:
Those from outside, to our place, you should not have come!
