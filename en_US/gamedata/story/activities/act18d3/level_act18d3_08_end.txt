Gladiia:
Hfff—

Seaborn:
Do you think you are more like me... or him?

Seaborn:
Gla-dia. You are strong.

Seaborn:
Emotions. Our kinsmen will learn it. There is much that we are passing on, and we will try to pass them on to you as well.

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla. Live. It's good to be alive. Our blood kin will find you again... and they will ask you.

Seaborn:
We don't know how to ask questions, but we will learn.

Skadi:
—It's dead.

Bishop:
You damned mixed-breeds.

Gladiia:
Yes, step right up. It's your turn now.

Gladiia:
This piece of trash is all by himself, and the Sea Terrors outside probably aren't from the same tribe. So they must be yours.

Bishop:
I will tear you to shreds. Your blasphemy will be punished.

Bishop:
I will do it myself. I will take care of you mixed bloods right here, right now. Life is precious, but to keep you alive would be a waste of resources.

Bishop:
One of you is heavily injured, and the other cannot so much as move. I will scatter what's left of you across the land so that you will be eaten by the most lowly of land creatures.

Bishop:
I can easily kill you two—

Gladiia:
Enough with the show. Unlike that piece of trash Seaborn, you at least used to be human, and now you are pretending to still be one. That just makes me want to puke.

Bishop:
(Shrieks)

Bishop:
This is where you will die!

???:
Forgot about me, did you?
