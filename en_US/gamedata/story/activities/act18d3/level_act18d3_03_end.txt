Anita:
Ah, you're back! I was just about to go find you.

Anita:
How come you've got sand stuck to you... did you go to the shore?

Skadi:
Yes.

Anita:
I told you not to go! But you just don't listen.

Anita:
Hurry, come inside with me, it's warm.

Skadi:
No need.

Anita:
Fine. This is for you! I found something to eat. I gave those clothes I half-sewed to Uncle Fireplace, and took some things from his. He's got quite a lot of food left, so he shouldn't mind it.

Anita:
It'll be forever before winter comes. If I just work at it a little more, I'm sure I'll find materials to use.

Skadi:
This shellmeat...

Skadi:
Just what is it you're eating?

Anita:
Ow! It hurts when you grab me like that... you're much too strong!

Skadi:
What is it you're eating...?

Anita:
We—We pick them off the coast!

Skadi:
There is no food in the sea here. Nothing to harvest whatsoever. This part of the ocean is silent.

Anita:
I told you, if you went to the shore today, of course there'd be nothing to eat.

Anita:
The time has to come...

Skadi:
What time?

Inhabitant:
One-hundred...

Inhabitant:
One-hundred!

Anita:
Oh, no! I hadn't even paid attention to the count. We're already at a hundred, then.

Skadi:
That pot.

Anita:
Weren't you asking me where all the food came from?

Anita:
On every hundredth flood and ebb of the tide, the grownups all get together like this, and each one takes a shell out from it.

Anita:
The shells in the pot are mostly white ones, and only one is red.

Anita:
Once the sun's gone down, the one who's taken the red one will go to the shore.

Anita:
And on morning the next day, there'll be food all over the shore.

Skadi:
And the one who went?

Anita:
Went to go live in the sea. Just as the laws say.

Skadi:
You believe in this too?

Anita:
Well, where else do you think they go?

Male Inhabitant A:
One-hundred. It has finally come.

Male Inhabitant A:
Here, Woodframe, why that face? This is a good day!

Male Inhabitant A:
Very soon, out of us, another lucky one will be chosen. They will leave before us, to live a better life.

Male Inhabitant A:
Come tomorrow, we will even have, fresh food aplenty. We will all survive. No matter whether gone to the sea, or left on the shore.

Anita:
I...

Male Inhabitant A:
You do not need to worry. You are already old enough. Very soon you will join this too, and have this greatest, opportunity.

Male Inhabitant A:
For now, you may go on as before. Give your blessings to that sibling.

Male Inhabitant B:
Sheetmetal, I, I...

Male Inhabitant A:
You have fallen over. Truly hopeless. What happened at the shore, earlier, weakened your leg.

Male Inhabitant B:
I do not understand why. I, I am so hungry... I have no strength. I am ill... I am going to die.

Male Inhabitant B:
That is right, what about the shell? The one I just drew...

Male Inhabitant A:
You dropped it on the ground.

Male Inhabitant B:
Is it... Is it a red one?

Male Inhabitant B:
Can, I go to live in the sea?

Male Inhabitant B:
In the sea, I will not hunger. Is that not right, Sheetmetal? I will live, a good life.

Male Inhabitant B:
You will... erk, bless me too, as the priest told, will you not?

Male Inhabitant A:
......

Male Inhabitant A:
You have mistaken it.

Male Inhabitant A:
Take it, for this is your shell. Look carefully at, what color it is. Do not let the saltwater muddle your eyes.

Male Inhabitant B:
A white one? Why would it be white... did I see wrong? I could not have. My eyes, are very fine.

Skadi:
(Plucks strings)

Male Inhabitant A:
You are here too.

Male Inhabitant A:
So this, is how you use that thing.

Male Inhabitant B:
*cough*, Sheetmetal, the shell in your hand... your hand, is clutched so tight. It is bleeding, is it not? I can see, reddest red...

Skadi:
If it's blessings you want, I have none for you.

Male Inhabitant A:
You understand nothing.

Male Inhabitant A:
This is what is truly meaningful. I know, at least, where I should go. I will very soon learn.

???:
What are you all doing?!

Anita:
That outfit... it's an Inquisitor!

Anita:
What is an Inquisitor doing here all of a sudden? They come so rarely.

Anita:
It was so many years ago when an Inquisitor last came... I was still very young then, and we were all living miserably.

Anita:
We couldn't find any more food in the city, and so many of us were ill. Everything was a mess, and everyday people passed away.

Anita:
The Inquisitors took a few people away. Those people never came back.

Anita:
Since then, the days have gotten a little better. We still starve, or die of illness, but at least we won't, um, we won't...

Anita:
I mean... that's an Inquisitor.

Skadi:
Oh.

Anita:
Shh, singer, don't anger her. She doesn't seem very happy at all.

Inquisitor:
I've seen what's happening here, and I've even heard it. You're plotting to send someone into the sea... Do you not know what it is you're trying to do?!

Inhabitant:
......

Inquisitor:
Speak! Why won't you speak? I don't like it, I don't like anything about this place. Disease, famine... I thought I'd have seen it here, with how hard it is to escape from.

Inquisitor:
According to prior reports, none of you should even be alive at this point, after all these years!

Inquisitor:
Yet reality begs to differ. You all seem to me in better shape than I'd imagined, yet blighted all too fiercely.

Inquisitor:
Do you all understand what your actions will eventually cause?

Inquisitor:
Look at me, answer me! Don't you know who I am?

Inhabitant:
You are an Inquisitor.

Inquisitor:
Thus, you are required to answer me, citizen!

Inhabitant:
This is the ocean's choice. The one who is chosen is the one who accepts it.

Inquisitor:
This isn't right! What in the world is the ocean's choice? As if the ocean had some kind of will of its own... a truly unsound suggestion!

Inquisitor:
The way I see it, you are conducting a collective murder! How could anyone entering the sea survive? On... on what basis do you sentence the innocent?

Inhabitant:
Entering the sea, is not death.

Inquisitor:
How do you know?

Inhabitant:
Do you know?

Inquisitor:
I... That's irrelevant. I only know that their departure will in all likelihood be more terrible than death itself.

Inquisitor:
And right now, I witness that you are coercing one amongst you.

Inhabitant:
We are not making them do it. This is their own choice.

Inhabitant:
If they want to go to the shore, we should not obstruct them. The laws do not say they cannot do this.

Inquisitor:
Unbridled nonsense! This is not in any way proper!

Inhabitant:
Then, what is proper? You are an Inquisitor. You may indicate to us.

Inquisitor:
At the very least, I know more about wrong than you all seem to.

Inquisitor:
What you're carrying out is impermissible conduct. Whether you see it or not, I still smell an odor of wickedness—

Inquisitor:
(Draws sword)

Inhabitant:
......

Inquisitor:
It seems you have no fear of my sword. Perhaps, though, you truly don't consider this a homicide.

Inquisitor:
You fear not even death. You're all becoming monsters before my very eyes.

Inquisitor:
Or yet... I suppose there's someone who wants you turned into monsters.

Inquisitor:
It may be your insanity was tugged astray by some actor. I will unearth this sin's source, I swear!

Skadi:
I'm out of here.

Anita:
Hm?

Skadi:
She's the one who can't hold it in. It's nothing to do with me.

Anita:
Who... Who's she? Do you mean... the Inquisitor?

Skadi:
Let's at least let her try.

Anita:
You've looked in an awful lot of houses this whole way.

Skadi:
You don't need to follow me.

Anita:
Can you really find who you're looking for, turning through one building after another like this?

Skadi:
I'll keep looking, then.

Anita:
Traveling the city north to south, west to east, would take a whole day or two.

Skadi:
If you didn't follow me, I could move faster.

Anita:
Does the one who wanted you here know you're looking for her? Didn't she mention any specific place?

Skadi:
......

Anita:
Ugh, it'll be dark in just a bit, so let's rest up. Singer, have you readied anywhere to stay tonight?

Skadi:
Anywhere will do.

Anita:
You can head back with me. I've mentioned the buildings in the north are a little better for wear. Plenty of us all live together.

Anita:
Look, there was still a little fin oil left over from last time. Uncle Fireplace was up early to light the lamps, and now the room's nice and bright.

Skadi:
I'll be fine.

Skadi:
I'll stay in here.

Anita:
This one? This one hasn't had anyone in it for forever.

Skadi:
I don't care about that.

Anita:
Never mind a bed, you'd barely find a single even nook in there. If you can't lie down, how are you going to sleep?

Skadi:
Standing, sitting. It makes no difference.

Anita:
Incredible...

Anita:
You're so strange. I didn't know what wandering singers were like, but the feeling you give me isn't like them.

Anita:
I thought people who love singing would all love laughing, joking. Not like you, you barely talk.

Anita:
And would people who love dancing not mind sitting somewhere dust-caked like you are, getting your skirt all dirty?

Skadi:
You should go home.

Anita:
Are you annoyed with me now?

Skadi:
This is no good place. As you said.

Anita:
But I want to keep you company.

Skadi:
I don't need company.

Anita:
Ugh, I realized. You've stared outside the whole time you've been here. Where are you looking at? The shore, the chapel?

Anita:
Are you going to head out again at night? Say, climb the hill, and take a look inside the chapel?

Skadi:
That is none of your business.

Anita:
True, it isn't. I'm just curious.

Skadi:
Take it.

Anita:
Your harp? What are you giving me this for?

Skadi:
You've been eyeing it the whole time. If you want it, just take it.

Anita:
What a pretty harp.

Anita:
(Plink-plunk)

Anita:
Such a nice sound. But I have no clue what to do with it. I can only watch you use it.

Skadi:
Then what do you want?

Anita:
Do you feel as though I'm only following you because I want what's yours?

Anita:
I just want to follow you, really.

Skadi:
......

Anita:
I know the only thing on your mind is finding someone, finding that fellow one of yours.

Skadi:
I need to verify a few things.

Anita:
You've been searching for her for many years now, haven't you?

Skadi:
Hm?

Anita:
That's the feeling you give me. The moment I mention finding her, the look in your eyes is different. They're the eyes of someone who's been on so very many journeys. There's times when the look in Grandma Petra's eyes is the same.

Anita:
So wonderful. I think, in the end, you can free yourself from her.

Skadi:
What?

Anita:
Burdens like this are too heavy.

Skadi:
I don't understand what you mean.

Anita:
No matter how long you persist for, come twenty or thirty years' time, whether it's you or her, you'll only want to be freed.

Anita:
And no one can persist for that long of a time, besides.

Skadi:
What are you saying here?

Anita:
I'm saying, you might just be the kind who's fated exceptionally well. You don't have to search for her anymore.

Skadi:
......

Anita:
Here, only those without any burden can live for very long. If their minds are fixated on one thing for so long, they go mad.

Anita:
Don't take me just for someone young. I've seen a lot of people go mad.

Skadi:
You don't understand.

Anita:
I don't understand what happened between you in the past. But things of the past, good or bad, can crush people once too much amasses.

Anita:
Just like I'm unsure if Grandma Petra's illness has gotten worse, every time she brings up the name Manuel.

Anita:
You're still young. You don't need to live such a hard life.

Skadi:
Things aren't as simple as that.

Anita:
Simple or not, you can try talking about it all the same.

Anita:
I'll be right here. I want to hear.

Skadi:
They're...

Skadi:
Even if I don't pay them mind, they won't just leave.

Skadi:
The more I don't pay them mind, the more they'll come find you, drown you...

Old José:
Here, you drink some too.

Skadi:
(She tilts her head and gulps.)

Old José:
Stop—not too much in one go, leave a drop for me. I need some too to help with sleepless nights.

Old José:
Goddamn. You piece of work, you.

Old José:
My ass, you're the disaster. You got Juan killed... This damnable papá couldn't even give you an earful in time before you came back looking half-dead. What the hell can I even say to you?

Old José:
I can't. A tomar por culo. I can't deal with it.

Skadi:
...I'm sorry.

Skadi:
The enemy's aim was me. No one who nears me... has a happy end.

Old José:
Look at what you're saying. Cursing me, aren't you?

Skadi:
You should keep your distance from me too.

Old José:
That I can do. Don't have to ask me twice.

Skadi:
......

Old José:
All right, sichtír, that doesn't mean I believe you're some ill omen. This line of work's bloodthirsty, and that little idiot didn't listen to his papá, died, and died in some goddamn mystery asshole's hands. If even you couldn't do anything, did I ever have a chance?

Old José:
That's not a hatred I can avenge. I've got nothing I can do to you either.

Old José:
Once we're done with this bit of drink, we'll be off again, going wherever we go.

Skadi:
Alright.

Old José:
You bastard! Were you always like this? Can't even find a single kind word, not so much as a profanity, huh?!

Skadi:
I've never been too good at the language here. I'm still not.

Old José:
Nah. You're just not willing to admit you've made a friend.

Old José:
Dammit. If we're to part, you might as well spare a couple more words. Where are you heading next?

Skadi:
I don't know.

Old José:
Same as ever, then. Drifting here and there, taking on missions with no point, fighting wave after wave of enemies who couldn't even take you if you were using one finger. Like living in an unending dream, isn't that?

Skadi:
......

Skadi tilts back and swigs. But the alcohol seems without a shred of effect on her.

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
Then where can I go, in your opinion?

Skadi:
You're all bounty hunters in order to make money, to live.

Skadi:
But I long since had nothing left.

Skadi:
It's savage, orderless. There's not even an automatic toilet. I don't want to be here, and this place doesn't need me. Why should I be here?

Skadi:
Weak, ignorant. Both plainly insatiable yet scared of dying. The things don't even understand me, yet when they come looking for me, they're not even willing to get out of the way.

Skadi:
I can't figure it out.

Old José:
Hold it, did you just crush a few bottles?

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
Beheading prey. Disposing of enemies. I'm born to do this.

Skadi:
They all die, and I live on. What do I live on for? Why do these disasters always come calling, but never kill me... always the ones by my side?

Skadi:
Juan was a good person.

Old José:
I don't need you to tell me, you damned Ægir hag!

Skadi:
Then why? Why is it always them who die?

Skadi:
I await, I search, I make sure all those shadows pursuing me will be slain, but I can't even find them, I can't even catch sight of them.

Skadi:
So what am I meant to do? What can I even do, except keep far away from everyone?

Skadi:
Who can even... tell me at this point?

Old José:
Fine, fine. You win. Tah-hathek.

Old José:
This whole bottle's yours. Down it, give crying your eyes out a go, like me. Then get some proper sleep.

Skadi:
It doesn't do much. I've already tried.

Old José:
Go dream actual dreams, hunter. For you, dreams might just be the more real thing. You never know, maybe you'll find some clues in there—you know, like a, uh, treasure map that only belongs to you?

Old José:
Find it. And then you can be on your way all the better. Cover your head and move forward. It beats being stuck circling in place.

Skadi:
A treasure map.

Anita:
Singer? Are you okay?

Anita:
You seemed very pained for a moment... I didn't know you could make that sort of face.

Skadi:
It's fine.

Anita:
And then you started pinching this thing. If you didn't treasure it so, I would've believed it was some awful artifact that angered you so much you wanted to pulverize it.

Anita:
You don't... look angry at all.

Skadi:
This is hers.

Anita:
Her? The fellow person you're looking for? Fine, I can see you just won't give up.

Skadi:
...She's not a burden.

Skadi:
She's the... one who helped me. She revealed the course of a craft to me.

Skadi:
If I keep following its direction and sailing on, maybe I'll be able to find answers.

Anita:
Singer, what are you looking for?

Skadi:
I still don't know. It may be who I am. It may be what I should do.

Skadi:
When... When you're searching for things in the ruins, do you know what you're possibly going to find?

Anita:
Wow. Put like that, I actually don't know.

Skadi:
I think, once I've found it I'll know.

Inquisitor:
Let me in!

Anita:
Shoot.

Anita:
Singer, don't you cross words with her. Open the door.

Skadi:
Why?

Anita:
......

Anita:
You're not an Iberian.

Skadi:
Say what you will.

Anita:
That's an Inquisitor. Hmm...

Inquisitor:
I know you're in there! Don't get cocky about your disguise, I saw you the moment you entered the city!

Inquisitor:
Open the door, citizen. You don't know what kind of person you're sheltering...

Anita:
Sheltering? No, I, I didn't mean to hide her...

Inquisitor:
I'll give you a count of three. If you don't open up, don't blame me for being discourteous.

Inquisitor:
One, two—

Inquisitor:
Three! *cough*, *cough* *cough*, so much dust! How long has this place been uninhabited...

Inquisitor:
Aha, Ægir, I've found you!

Anita:
Wh—What fast moves—

Anita:
Singer... did you dodge?! That posture... I can't imagine it myself.

Anita:
Stood on the chair... the backrest? People can stand on that? How is she stood so steadily?!

Inquisitor:
A fluke and no more!

Inquisitor:
I must see for sure, how long can your good luck last you?

Anita:
She dodged again! In a single swish—she went from this end of the house to that... She's even lighter than seagrass flung in a gale, even faster!

Skadi:
That stick of yours is useless against me.

Inquisitor:
St... Stick?!

Inquisitor:
This is an affront...

Inquisitor:
You will pay for your false words!

Anita:
Whoaaa—so strong too! The chair split apart, the cupboard, and now there's even a crack through the floor!

Anita:
I—I can't bear to watch... oh, the singer...

Anita:
Wait, she's alright? She evaded all of that? Such nimbleness!

Anita:
No... it doesn't seem like she's dodging. Her steps aren't forced in any way. It actually has a peculiar feel of rhythm to it...

Anita:
So—So beautiful.

Inquisitor:
How long do you plan to hide, Ægir?

Inquisitor:
Like the rest of your kind, you steal into our country, stowing away in the shadows—

Inquisitor:
Heyah!

Anita:
Did that slant away? The slash cut against the wall...?

Anita:
Has the Inquisitor... tired out?

Inquisitor:
Heh! At no moment does my sword ever slant—

Anita:
The—The wall collapsed!

Anita:
How fortunate, we're on the other side...

Anita:
But the singer... has no way out now. The Inquisitor did that intentionally.

Inquisitor:
Nowhere left to hide.

Inquisitor:
Take this blow, for it is your crimes put on trial!

Skadi:
Damn it.

Inquisitor:
Gh... how?

Inquisitor:
How can my blade be so casually blocked?

Inquisitor:
Though I have not used all my strength... person of Ægir, just what are you?

Skadi:
A wandering singer.

Inquisitor:
Drivel! I've been following you ever since you entered Sal Viento.

Inquisitor:
Who are you fooling? What wandering singer... has such skills?!

Skadi:
Seems Mister José wasted his effort.

Inquisitor:
And who is this José?

Inquisitor:
And your acts at the shore! I saw it all!

Inquisitor:
Confess! Why have you stolen into our land?

Skadi:
You care too much.

Anita:
S—So strong!

Anita:
She's not just unafraid of the Inquisitor, she's taunting her?

Anita:
It might not be a taunt. The singer just speaks this way. I've gotten used to it after half the day. But... *cough*, now the Inquisitor is even angrier.

Inquisitor:
I am an... Inquisitor!

Inquisitor:
All things that occur in Iberia are my business.

Inquisitor:
All errors proscribed under the law... we find, we even out.

Inquisitor:
There's something not right about the sea here. Their numbers have grown. This city is on the eve of... no, perhaps it has already become a lair of evils.

Inquisitor:
Speak, Ægir. All these abnormalities, they are all your doing, correct?

Inquisitor:
It was you who brought about disaster, had those things assemble here—

Skadi:
Yes.

Inquisitor:
You inculcated heretical thought into the citizens here, drove them to enter the sea. Look at them, they've all now become as grotesque as you!

Skadi:
Hm?

Inquisitor:
You undoubtedly saw it. You clearly brought something about in the ocean here. Yet see the look in your eyes—

Inquisitor:
You simply—do not care!

Skadi:
Mm...

Inquisitor:
How can such indifference claim resemblance to a normal human? And you dare to say this wasn't your doing?!

Inquisitor:
I will not let you escape, Ægiii—iiir! Do you consider the calamity you've brought to this country a trifle? Your lot are scheming something, of this I am absolutely certain!

Skadi:
Huh?

Anita:
What's the Inquisitor talking about?

Anita:
The singer's only been here for half a day... and what disaster? Who's grotesque?

Anita:
Don't we... voluntarily enter the sea?

Anita:
What other Ægir are there?

Anita:
I don't understand.

Skadi:
You can't overcome me.

Inquisitor:
How can we know without trying further?

Skadi:
This is a pure waste of time.

Inquisitor:
Tch. You're correct. What have I been wasting all this talk on you for?

Inquisitor:
I should have long since—apprehended you first.

Anita:
Huh?!

Skadi:
Get down. Don't come out.

Inquisitor:
Heh, do you know my might now, Ægir?

Skadi:
(She brushes off her hem.)

Skadi:
An extra bullet hole. Can't return this to Mister José in original condition now.

Inquisitor:
You... You! You're without a scratch?! How could you be? My aim was true!

Skadi:
Are you finished?

Skadi:
Your weapon. You don't use it lightly.

Skadi:
Otherwise, you wouldn't be talking to me now. You ought to aim a second time.

Inquisitor:
I...

Skadi:
I don't understand what you're talking about, nor do I care.

Skadi:
I don't want to...
