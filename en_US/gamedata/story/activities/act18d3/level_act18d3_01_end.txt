???:
Skadi.

???:
You've fallen, Skadi. The old you could've made chunks out of them with just a touch.

Skadi:
Mister José, I am not that bloody.

Old José:
Hard to say. You've changed, then. You even gave them a chance to escape.

Skadi:
Possibly.

Old José:
What wind blew you back here again? Why were they waiting to spring you—something to do with me?

Skadi:
I don't know.

Old José:
I hear you're not in our line of work anymore. Joined some... pharma company? What are you shirking good, decent work for to tromp around these rundown outskirts again?

Skadi:
You're well-informed, Mister José. This time I need you to help me out.

Old José:
Several years have come and gone. Here I thought you'd folded, seeing as you went through plenty of Kazimierz bounty hunters. This far out from Kazimierz, and I could still hear word of what you'd been up to.

Old José:
Always thought you only knew how to make big ruckuses.

Old José:
But you've been quiet as this now.

Old José:
You came roadrollering in all the way from Minos country like a tow truck, just to find me? Go on, then, tell me what you want.

Skadi:
I need to get to Sal Viento.

Old José:
Sal... Viento?

Skadi:
Don't tell me. Even you've never heard of the place?

Old José:
No, I've heard. Out of all us information peddlers, only I must've heard. The question's you—what makes you want to go there?

Old José:
There's nothing there anymore. Few decades ago... close to nothing left after.

Old José:
So close to such a vast patch of ocean, and you think anything'd be left? No better than bare frames left, letting the wind and all through.

Old José:
Many bounty hunters wanting to get up to those abandoned cities, just like beastlings pouncing on a rotting burdenbeast corpse.

Old José:
All of them thinking there's still meat they can pick off. They don't know whatever they swallow there might as well be a batch of poison.

Old José:
Iberia. All of them think this unspeaking Iberia's just like Kazimierz and Gaul, treasure all over the map.

Old José:
Hah, there's nothing there at all. When a place has nothing at all, it's likelier than all it could have anything.

Skadi:
So do you tell those bounty hunters anything?

Old José:
If they ask me to sell info, I'll sell it. As far as ones like me go, whether those folks come back or don't, it's all business.

Old José:
Fact is, they don't come back at all. Not one ever comes back.

Old José:
Two weeks ago, a team came to me. Lackeys of the 'Daggerhorn.'

Old José:
He had equipment leagues better than all these runts lying around. Very experienced too. Brought more than ten with him. Still haven't seen them again yet.

Old José:
Very many wonder about where they went. They could've been caught by the Penal Battalion, or it could've been the Iberian Defensa's doing, but I've heard tell of a different possibility.

Old José:
Over there be... monsters.

Skadi:
Oh.

Old José:
Or it was the Inquisition that got 'em. I don't know what's a more wretched end.

Skadi:
Monsters or people, my sword draws little distinction. There are only those who block my way, and those who don't.

Old José:
Alright, alright. You can't be going to Sal Viento for a holiday, that much's for sure.

Skadi:
I need to find someone.

Old José:
What poor bastard has your wrath this time?

Skadi:
This time's different. It's my... It's someone I knew from before.

Old José:
Before you even knew me?

Skadi:
Much before.

Old José:
Here I thought they'd all left. Or died. At least, that's what you told me back in those days.

Skadi:
That's why I'm searching. There's a few things I need to figure out.

Old José:
You've been searching for quite some years, yeah?

Old José:
That whole ruckus from last time couldn't have been for any knights' treasure's sakes.

Skadi:
You told me before. People ought to move forward.

Old José:
—

Old José:
Did you bring a treasure map with you?

Skadi:
What?

Old José:
There're many, some of them even old hands. They travel the barrens, traveling and traveling, and forget where they wanted to go, or what they were even looking for.

Old José:
They just keep on traveling. They don't know starvation, they don't know exhaustion.

Old José:
Until the barrenlands do them in.

Skadi:
They were too weak.

Old José:
Weak? No matter how much stronger, a hunter could still never conquer the boundless barrenlands. So many hunters die for no sure reason out on the road, and don't even know what they're searching for come their deaths—that's not an ending that suits you.

Skadi:
Why are you telling me all this?

Skadi:
As if I've never told you before? They wouldn't rival even the tiniest Ægir machine.

Old José:
You're strong. So did you save my son's life?

Skadi:
I'm sorry.

Old José:
Don't say sorry! I'm not trying to flog you here. I'm trying to get you thinking. It's you who hasn't forgiven yourself, not me.

Old José:
I only regret that I didn't break his legs, stop him following an old papá in his old tracks. Nothing to do with you.

Old José:
You say you came from the sea. I've never heard of any other sea than the one in Iberia. You're someone I don't know.

Old José:
So what about you? Is there no one you don't know?

Old José:
Because that's the kind that killed my son. Someone you don't even know.

Skadi:
That's the sort of thing I'm afraid of.

Old José:
Never mind it. At least the people you talk about wouldn't spend day and night plotting to kill me. What are you thinking of doing in Sal Viento?

Skadi:
I have a friend who's been taken there.

Old José:
Strange, that.

Old José:
Take this. Map.

Skadi:
Alright. What do I need to give you?

Old José:
Give me?

Skadi:
You sell intel. One thing for another. You've given me information, I'll give you what you need.

Old José:
(Flicks cigarette ash)

Old José:
Let me think... That year you brought my young Juan's body back, you handed him to me. Head and arms all still attached to him. So, now we're even.

Skadi:
Mister José, my greatest thanks.

Skadi:
I'll be going, then. Take care.

Old José:
Stop! Are you in such a hurry to get yourself killed?!

Skadi:
Hm?

Old José:
Hey. Tell me—has anyone ever said anything like that to you before?

Skadi:
No.

Old José:
Then you need somebody to tell you well.

Old José:
You're strolling straight into an Iberian city dressed in all your bounty hunter clothes?

Skadi:
Yes.

Old José:
You really haven't changed, Skadi. Here I am parching my mouth, and I might as well be the wind for all the good telling you anything does.

Old José:
The Iberian Defensa'd have you ten times over for looking like that!

Old José:
And how much time are you ready to waste on them? How much longer can the person you're looking for wait? Iberians aren't like these lousy bounty hunters. They're not that easy to break clean of.

Skadi:
You want to suggest something to me.

Old José:
I can lend you a few things. Take this harp.

Skadi:
Harp?

Old José:
Can you play? I remember you played before.

Skadi:
I can.

Old José:
Good, all the better. Would be fine if you couldn't, long as you pulled off the act.

Old José:
Change into these too.

Skadi:
What clothes are these? They're very strange.

Old José:
Whether you're used to them isn't the point. Iberians are.

Skadi:
......

Old José:
From now on, you're the wandering singer Skadi.

Old José:
Go where you want now, singer. Follow the map, go by the waterways, and you'll get there soon enough. This you can do, Ægir.

Skadi:
Farewell, Mister José.

Old José:
Skadi!

Old José:
Don't you die out there. You have to die with someone, someone you know.

Skadi:
......

Skadi:
Right.

Bounty Hunter:
Help—Help me!

Bounty Hunter:
What are these things... they—they're tangling me, they won't let go! Chopping them apart doesn't even work. Is the entire coast all monsters like this?

Bounty Hunter:
Hey—get away, get the hell away!

Bounty Hunter:
I wouldn't have come if I goddamn knew! Ja pierdolę, 'Yellow Smog,' bastard, if only you weren't so useless to get hoodwinked back then, would I still be stuck picking up garbage out here?!

Bounty Hunter:
Skurwysyny, if I'm not dead by the end of this I'll wish I was! Goddamned Iberia! Country of the actual goddamned!

Bounty Hunter:
What—What the hell was that? Turning them all to paste in one shot?

Bounty Hunter:
Huff... huff. Whatever it was, at least it lets me live another day—

Bounty Hunter:
Ugh—

???:
You. You're not leaving.

Bounty Hunter:
And—And who are you? Where the hell does Iberia get all these freaks from?

???:
Second time. Iberia forbids the spreading of rumors. The next you move to speak, be much more careful.

Bounty Hunter:
What? Look at that getup, that weapon—

Bounty Hunter:
Holy shit. You, you're... that's it, I'm done for, I'm...

???:
Commander. The coast is clean now.

???:
This place is void of all living—er, excepting this outsider who can't stand still and stinks to high Heaven.

???:
What did you see?

Bounty Hunter:
I... I...

Bounty Hunter:
Please, I haven't done anything! I swear it, I, I was only lost, I was too careless to end up here, I didn't mean to...

Bounty Hunter:
Look, I have gold coins, and plenty of other stuff too, damnit, I've lost so much... Take this money, this equipment, all of it, I just beg you to let me go!

???:
Gather your scraps. When the Commander asks you a question, it's not to hear you blather, outsider.

Bounty Hunter:
Question? What question? I swear, honor, I wouldn't dare ask questions... I've got no questions, I guarantee...

Bounty Hunter:
I beg you, honor, I don't want... Don't take me... I'd be better off if I just died!

???:
Casting yourself into the sea in front of me? Do you still think it's not too late?

Bounty Hunter:
That sword... my hand... too close... wargh...

???:
Now, have you regained some sense? You outsiders are as good as insects in the weeds, hearts avaricious and blackened, yet always so quick to fall to pieces.

Bounty Hunter:
Ugh, ah... I'm not running anywhere, honor, I'll tell you anything.

???:
Good. I do not like repeating my questions. This will therefore be the final time.

???:
What did you see on the coast?

Bounty Hunter:
I, I... *cough* *cough*... I saw monsters.

???:
How many of you came?

Bounty Hunter:
Originally twelve... uh, counting the guide, we're thirteen total.

???:
Commander. He's not lying. I've found the corpses myself along the coast.

Bounty Hunter:
*Sob*...

???:
Hey. What use will crying be for you now? If it weren't for you all intruding, they wouldn't have sought you out. When you violate the law, you should anticipate the costs.

???:
That said, twelve have died... They've been proliferating in number, all along the way here.

???:
They can't have gone too far from their nest.

???:
This serves to show your judgment was sound. The closer one approaches, the more numerous they are. There is surely something amiss going on in that town!

???:
You may depart.

???:
And this fellow? He has seen much he shouldn't have.

Bounty Hunter:
Spare... Spare me! I've told you everything I can! Sir, Commander, your honor... ohh, mama...

???:
What... did you see?

Bounty Hunter:
I... I...

Bishop:
We made an agreement.

???:
I do not know what sense lies in such conduct.

Bishop:
You agreed to it.

???:
Agreed? Pledged—(Bones and flesh chafe against each other.)—promised? To prior be granted an act, and afterwards to accomplish one different?

???:
No.

???:
To such requests of yours, I will respond. No agreement, nor promise.

Bishop:
A response... but of course.

Bishop:
Honorable herald—

Bishop:
That you will to respond is already my honor.
