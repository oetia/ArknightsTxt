Anita:
That should take care of it, I think? We should have enough for me, Grandma, and Bench...

Anita:
Oh, and the singer too. She will come back, right? We can't let her go hungry.

Anita:
We still have... some. We can put the rest in the box.

Anita:
Uh, Uncle Fireplace, you wanted some? O-Okay, I can give you some first.

Anita:
Whoa, I think that's seaweed on your arm! Let me have it! I'll make the... uh... seaweed alcohol that the singer taught me to make!

Anita:
Huh? Where did Bench go? I only took my eyes off for a moment.

Young Inhabitant:
(Makes children noises)

Young Inhabitant:
Ah... Songs... Ahhh...

Skadi:
Stop grabbing...

Skadi:
This is yours.

Young Inhabitant:
Whaa...

Skadi:
Stop chewing it... It's not something you can eat.

Young Inhabitant:
Woodframe... Woodframe...

Skadi:
Don't call her...

Skadi:
Yeah, give her my harp, will you?

Skadi:
Tell her... No, I guess you can't talk.

Skadi:
This isn't a goodbye.

Skadi:
I'll go ask a question. Then, I'll tell her myself.

Inquisitor Irene:
High Inquisitor, are we planting explosives at the hill right now?

High Inquisitor:
That is correct.

Inquisitor Irene:
On another note, I saw someone entering the chapel.

Inquisitor Irene:
She looks very much like that... outsider we met before.

High Inquisitor:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
So, High Inquisitor, who is she?

High Inquisitor:
An Ægir.

Inquisitor Irene:
I heard she fought the Sea Terrors.

Inquisitor Irene:
I'm surprised there are others who not only know about these monsters... but specialize in fighting them as well...

Inquisitor Irene:
If we blow up the chapel... Will she be affected?

High Inquisitor:
If we don't strike the evil at its root, even destroying this place won't accomplish anything.

Inquisitor Irene:
Is that so? So we still have to find out who caused this phenomenon... And you don't know who it is yourself, High Inquisitor?

High Inquisitor:
You may not ask anything that has nothing to do with the mission.

Inquisitor Irene:
Understood...

Inquisitor Irene:
Also, while I'm aware you don't mind, I have to say this nonetheless... The load-bearing structure of this block probably won't withstand the intensity of the explosion.

Inquisitor Irene:
The southern half of the city may crumble any moment, and the inhabitants here still don't know anything about this.

High Inquisitor:
Proceed.

Inquisitor Irene:
Uh...

Inquisitor Irene:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
I want to evacuate the inhabitants.

Inquisitor Irene:
I mean, to you, they may seem peculiar and problematic...

Inquisitor Irene:
...and also things that need to be cleansed.

High Inquisitor:
Inquisitor!

Inquisitor Irene:
Uhh...!

High Inquisitor:
Tell me! What is your responsibility?!

Inquisitor Irene:
Yes!

Inquisitor Irene:
'For Iberia's prosperity, for Iberia's defense, and for Iberia's orderliness and integrity, I shall raise my sword and my light!'

High Inquisitor:
In that case, you must lay down your judgment for these men!

Inquisitor Irene:
You want me to... lay down judgment? To sentence them to death?

Inquisitor Irene:
High Inquisitor, when was the last time you listened to a song? Your records have all gone bad, haven't they? Your player has been gathering dust for a long time too.

Inquisitor Irene:
I heard that song. I heard the song the Ægir was singing for these people.

Inquisitor Irene:
That's the kind of song that Iberia should have had.

Inquisitor Irene:
Before we kill them, I want to know the truth. Just like you were trying to find who is behind this.

Inquisitor Irene:
Perhaps they will still mutate, but when that time comes, I will cleanse them myself, but I would like to evacuate them right now.

Inquisitor Irene:
High Inquisitor, if I have your permission, I will evacuate everyone right away!

High Inquisitor:
Is that your decision?

Inquisitor Irene:
I don't know!

High Inquisitor:
Irene, you are not just laying down decisions for those you see in front of you. Your decisions affect much more!

High Inquisitor:
By sentencing the monsters to live, you also sentence the citizens to die!

Inquisitor Irene:
I understand! I've already made decisions like this one countless of times!

High Inquisitor:
Your judgment can mitigate disasters or portend ill omens! You may kill hundreds merely to save one!

Inquisitor Irene:
I understand that, Sir!

Inquisitor Irene:
What's at stake behind this deal, the clashes between morals and scriptures... I understand it all!

High Inquisitor:
That isn't what I'm asking you.

Inquisitor Irene:
......

High Inquisitor:
What I'm asking you, Irene, is if you can truly bear this responsibility.

High Inquisitor:
If you bring them great pain, then you too must bear this pain as well, and it will be far graver than the sins you inflict on others combined.

High Inquisitor:
Do you have the courage? Will your beliefs remain steadfast when your heart is tormented? If you fail, are you certain you can stay unflinching when you witness the outcome of your decision?

Inquisitor Irene:
I can take it... and I won't waver.

Inquisitor Irene:
That's what I've been doing all along ever since I joined the Inquisition. I can do it. If what I do proves to be wrong, then let me receive the proper punishment. This is something I must do.

Inquisitor Irene:
High Inquisitor! I—

High Inquisitor:
Very well.

Inquisitor Irene:
Hm...?

High Inquisitor:
This will do. Do your duty, Inquisitor.

Inquisitor Irene:
—Yes, High Inquisitor! I will evacuate the local inhabitants right away!

Inquisitor Irene:
Also... The explosives left in the cabinet should be enough to level the whole of Sal Viento.

High Inquisitor:
That's right.

Inquisitor Irene:
So...

High Inquisitor:
If it comes to it, I will override your judgment.

Inquisitor Irene:
Right...

Inquisitor Irene:
I'll get going now.

High Inquisitor:
Who is it?

???:
Hello, High Inquisitor.

Bishop:
Oh, look who's here?

Bishop:
Welcome, wandering singer.
