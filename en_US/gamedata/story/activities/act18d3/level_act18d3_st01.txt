Bishop:
Now quick, come in, come in. I knew that you would make it here.

Skadi:
How?

Bishop:
What can I say...?

Skadi:
Hmph. No need.

Bishop:
Do you carry that case everywhere you go, wandering singer?

Skadi:
Yes.

Bishop:
Then would you mind if I asked another question?

Skadi:
Go ahead.

Bishop:
What is inside this case?

Skadi:
A saxophone.

Bishop:
Ah, very well, a saxophone... a wind instrument. Quite good.

Bishop:
May I have the fortune to hear it? Music... this city has not heard music for a swathe of years.

Bishop:
Oh, no, beg pardon... I realize asudden that a wandering singer takes coin for her song.

Bishop:
This does stump me. You see, I fear I cannot proffer much tip to speak of.

Bishop:
Yet look at this old building. Humph, taking care of it is quite the challenging task, when currency stands for little here, none will collect it, and none will use it.

Bishop:
But I can spare energy to prepare you a luncheon. Wandering singer, what say you? Would you will to perform a little something or other?

Bishop:
It is in my power, at least, to invite you to eat your fill, though it may not be any gourmet delicacy...

Skadi:
......

Bishop:
I see you are fallen silent... Ah, might I guess: you prefer dance, rather than song?

Bishop:
You see, you are wearing a dancer's dress... you are talented. It has been too long since last we had a friend with such brilliant luster as you.

Skadi:
(...Sickening.)

Skadi:
If you want to listen to something, you can let me sing for now.

Skadi:
I came to ask a question. The person standing by you probably knows. I don't think you can escape the issue anymore.

Gladiia:
......

Bishop:
Were my—people, here, and you, once familiar?

Gladiia:
We naturally were.

Bishop:
I was not asking you.

Skadi:
We aren't.

Bishop:
Oh...?

Skadi:
Because I have no idea now if this person is the one I originally knew.

Bishop:
Oh, oh...

Bishop:
This, too, is normal. All people may change. Seawater beats against dry land, and can turn the coast into sand, given time.

Bishop:
So. Your arrival, was it not her who willed it?

Skadi:
—Wasn't it you who wanted me to come?

Bishop:
Were it merely my bidding, you would not show here, correct? I am only a stranger.

Bishop:
I simply ask; did she will you to come, or not?

Skadi:
She didn't. I came on my own.

Bishop:
Hmm, you are not lying. I can hear when lies are told... but you are honest.

Skadi:
You keep asking, and I still haven't even said anything. How can you be this obnoxious?

Bishop:
Be calm, be calm, singer. It was not my intention. A little prudence does us all good.

Skadi:
Then my turn to ask.

Skadi:
This city's people all have great trust in you, but what happens on the seashore—

Skadi:
—is absolutely not normal.

Skadi:
Scrap-begging. Sea Terrors. The ocean.

Skadi:
Where are you from? You know something, don't you? What have you and her hidden from me?

Bishop:
Ah, hah-hah. Yes, indeed, I know a good deal more than others.

Bishop:
Indeed, I know of one who wants to meet you.

Skadi:
Meet me? Since I'm a wandering singer?

Bishop:
The one who cares for music is me.

Bishop:
Though it may invite some disbelief, the one wanting to meet you is not me.

Bishop:
It is a friend of mine. I bid you here on his request.

Skadi:
Who? He wants to meet me?

Bishop:
Come with me. You shall know when you see him.

Bishop:
After all... you have a friend here too.

Bishop:
Please, in here.

Bishop:
As for you.

Gladiia:
......

Bishop:
Come too. The time for your reward, too, is come.

Bishop:
Regretfully, I will not light a lamp, but this should pose you no trouble, should it?

Bishop:
I have heard wandering singers to be quite agile by and large. Neither city nor barrens are too friendly, and those going afar easily come to suffer. One must learn the basics of protecting themselves.

Bishop:
Wealth cannot buy music, yet music can serve as wealth. So long as a fine song is sung, one will not starve wherever they go...

Bishop:
I used to yearn greatly for that sort of life, likely because I am no good at what it demands... Once I set down roots somewhere, it is very hard for me to up and leave again.

Bishop:
We are here.

Skadi:
Don't tell me we're...

Bishop:
Correct. On the seafloor.

Skadi:
That's—!

Specter's body floats in a vat of water, as if dead, or perhaps sound asleep.

Untold thoughts flash through Skadi's head.

Why is she here? Did Gladiia do this? What if Specter is dead? How could Gladiia allow Specter to die?! Could she truly be—

Bishop:
And that is your friend, isn't it?

Bishop:
You are called Skadi? I have not been the one following your affairs. They have handled you very well...

Bishop:
Especially the ones by your side. They have handled it all well, letting you uphold your mental state under such emotions.

Skadi:
—

Skadi:
What?

Bishop:
They have had no time to attend to you lately, but by the humble grace of your leader here, you have come, practically as a gift to me.

Bishop:
I am surprised you step forth first... and not that minstrel. What are you waiting for? Why did you not kill me before?

Gladiia:
Would you be so stupid?

Bishop:
You unhallowed things, and your eternal condition... Your fine sense of ego, expressed without meaning. Would you be just as unconcerned if this experiment, her life, vanished here?

Gladiia:
Confirming your results gave you confidence. Your satisfaction grinned in your words, yet you wouldn't let me see where you took her. I imagine you cannot let her die yet.

Gladiia:
Out of us few, I'm sure her life is the one you place most importance on.

Gladiia:
I've destroyed your experiment grounds—

Bishop:
To little surprise, it was your doing.

Gladiia:
—Specter is highly valuable. Out of all the Originium infection tests you've conducted on the Abyssal Hunters, only this one specimen tells the tale.

Bishop:
The original sin of terrestrial lowlife beasts can be effected upon those unholy bodies of yours. Is it not so very interesting?

Bishop:
Although... I must say, you have wrought too much damage on the site we three are in. Having committed so much refined, liquefied Originium, having applied Ægir technology... all of it, never to be seen again.

Bishop:
She is highly valuable indeed. My one mystery is how she fends against an Originium infection of such scope... Her spinal cord, diluted, would be enough to infect a small country.

Bishop:
Things have changed now. Thank you for placing her in my hands, unhallowed thing. I will lead the other two... I will discover all your final secrets.

Bishop:
I will prove my own success. My research. Our enemy's secrets. As well as weaknesses...

Gladiia:
You will lead off by dying here.

Gladiia:
My sparing your life testified: you are that person, one and the same. I've already executed those not worth sparing.

Gladiia:
As it's proven how you, them, and this experiment are all implicated, you need not be alive any longer.

Skadi:
The Church of the Deep... you're from the Church of the Deep.

Bishop:
Did I permit you to address me so?

Skadi:
You're far too good at hiding. Each one of you is unalike. You'll say anything and everything.

Skadi:
Was Specter also driven to derangement... by your indoctrination and torture?

Skadi:
Those people outside. You exploited them. Are they experiments to you too?

Skadi:
Have all the people cast into the sea... been sacrifices for your tests?

Bishop:
Impudent.

Bishop:
The ocean's almsgiving is no manner of exploitation. It is salvation.

Bishop:
I could concern myself none with them, and they would die.

Bishop:
The ocean gives them food, gives those unwilling to live the freedom to live on in rebirth...

Bishop:
How could you unhallowed things hope to understand...

Gladiia:
Enough, bishop. Have I ever shown care for your objective before? If you remember anything false, I invite you to forget it immediately. Your disgraceful conduct defies description. The only thing I mind is how much further your toxin might drift.

Gladiia:
This is far enough.

Bishop:
You believed bringing one more... would let you topple me with ease?

Bishop:
You and your kind alike are so self-confident—so stupid.

Gladiia:
I know that some of you chose to become Sea Terrors already. I fear that won't serve as a trump card.

Gladiia:
Even if you can become a Seaborn—

Skadi:
Captain!

With her speed, Gladiia is able to dodge before the sound even crosses.

But before anything, it requires that Gladiia intend to dodge.

Gladiia had not even been aware...

Gladiia:
Haugh, hgh-eugh... (Choking on her blood)

???:
Gla-dia. His request was this. And so I did.

???:
Rest.

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla.

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla. I wanted to meet you.

Seaborn:
Countless years buoyant. Countless years roving. Countless lived and died.

Bishop:
*Spit*...

Bishop:
Idiotic unhallowed. If the herald did not request you, all you unholy things would have been dead on the beach long ago.

Skadi:
Bastard...

Bishop:
Herald, put an end to this problem. Watching these people encroach on our ocean has always sickened me.

Seaborn:
Are you that eager to attack them?

Bishop:
How many of our own kind have these things killed, these mixed-breeds brought about by Ægir?

Seaborn:
Could it be you are—not one.

Seaborn:
Then I will finish asking this question first.

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla, my sister.

Skadi:
What...?

Bishop:
......

Seaborn:
Sister, right now, you are not coherent of where you came from.

Skadi:
I come from Ægir, monster... I am your natural enemy.

Seaborn:
You are not coherent.

Seaborn:
Then let me tell you the truth of things.

Seaborn:
You are we.

Skadi:
......

Seaborn:
What flows through you is our blood.

Skadi:
Liar!

Bishop:
Herald, you... what?

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla. Your blood is our blood.

Seaborn:
Your bodies were, and then our blood entered.

Seaborn:
I have innumerous blood-kin. They meet you. They die.

Seaborn:
They smell your scent. Just as you smell our scent.

Seaborn:
They believe their fellow kin are trapped under your skins. They bite at your hide and flesh regardless of the danger, wishing to release their own kin from your vesicles.

Seaborn:
They have not prepared themselves, and they have not at that point the organs to realize with.

Seaborn:
You are not trapping kin within your bodies. You are our kin.

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla. You are we.

Seaborn:
I will wake you. You will recall that sensation. Ægir bodies are frail, and things pass too quickly. I will help you seek it out.

Skadi:
Stop. Stop!

Seaborn:
But yet, you wish to know. I know you wish to know.

Skadi:
You kill us Ægir... and now you intend on being related to me?!

Seaborn:
My blood and your blood are identical.

Seaborn:
You smell my scent, exactly as we smell your scent.

Seaborn:
You find us, kill us...

Seaborn:
When we do not understand, we kill you too.

Seaborn:
We feed the ocean. Our bodies have provided for the ocean.

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla, we possess the same home.

Skadi:
You killed my family. It was you who killed my mother, my grandmother, my little sister.

Seaborn:
No. We wouldn't.

Seaborn:
We do not go to Ægir cities.

Skadi:
So many cities, all destroyed by you!

Seaborn:
Those cities are on our territory.

Skadi:
Keh! Even in the hinterland cities of Ægir, you still hunt people!

Seaborn:
No... No.

Seaborn:
We would not do that. Those who die in the cities are unable to provide for the many.

Seaborn:
The Ægir attack us, we attack the Ægir. There is no difference.

Seaborn:
Those in your territory die, by those in your territory's doing.

Skadi:
Lies!

Seaborn:
Lies? I wish to know what lies means. 'Liar,' too, you said earlier. I wish to know.

Skadi:
No, no...!

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla, the barrier between you and we is too strong. You have no way to pass on your ideas to we.

Seaborn:
For you to know what we think, that is enough.

Seaborn:
My body has grown, is able to speak, is able to communicate with you.

Seaborn:
Language is bloated, not easy to use. I can only talk this way, but this way you are able to tell me.

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla, I came to meet you.

Skadi:
I and you... are not...

Seaborn:
You often feel, the creatures around you, are unfamiliar to you.

Seaborn:
When you travel, you are able to sense the direction of seawater, and know much of what happens in the unlit ocean.

Seaborn:
At some times you sleep, you feel you are swimming with we many.

Skadi:
Why did you have to tell me this? Why did you have to say this?

Skadi:
......

Seaborn:
You have remembered.

Bishop:
...It cannot be...

Bishop:
Why did... we never before... why could we never before see it?! Why could we not find out?!

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla. I have a question to ask, Ishar-mla. Lift your head up.

Skadi:
I killed it.

Seaborn:
You did not.

Skadi:
I killed...

Skadi:
I killed Him...

Skadi:
He did nothing, and I... I still...

Skadi:
Even my... my little sister... was... an Ægir... an Ægir...

Seaborn:
Sin?

Skadi:
My sin... I...

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla, do not feel misgiving. We have no sin.

Seaborn:
You only did what you were able to do, Ishar-mla. We kin act without sin.

Skadi:
But I acted for Ægir... We killed so many...

Seaborn:
You believe you are an Ægir, so you are right to kill.

Seaborn:
You regard the others as your blood-kin, so you do so, we do not know, and when we attack you and you do so, you are right.

Skadi:
—

Skadi:
Why?

Seaborn:
—Ishar-mla.

Seaborn:
Only Ægir, the scaleless, the finless, your language contains 'sin.'

Seaborn:
To do to survive, is always right.

Skadi:
So...

Seaborn:
You have no wrong. So you can speak of anything you know. We have no want or will, only speak and do not speak.

Seaborn:
I may ask questions. Speak.

Seaborn:
Ishar-mla. Under your attack, we lost our contact with it, our ever close contact. We can only sense its pulse, we cannot hear its voice.

Seaborn:
The last time you swam together, the last time you attacked together, was then.

Seaborn:
And so...

Seaborn:
When it once again sunk into sleep before you, did you—

Seaborn:
Hear it as it spoke?

Skadi:
He—

Skadi:
He spoke—

Bishop:
You?! Herald!

Seaborn:
Ah. Only next time...

Seaborn:
(His bodily fluids audibly clog.)

Seaborn:
Gla-dia...

Seaborn:
(It comes in a voice just like a whimper.) ...You are so sturdy, Gla-dia.

Gladiia:
Trash. (Ægirian) I won't give you a single scrap of courtesy.

Gladiia:
(Ægirian) The hunted should behave... and scream wretched in their traps. You are the hunted here, trash.

Seaborn:
Sister... your signal's transmission... so dense.

Gladiia:
Emotion. Hatred. How could the hunted understand?

Gladiia:
Love. Hate. Pain. Sorrow. Joy. Contentment. All are worthless in your eyes. You think these are dregs... that they are unnecessary, superfluous, don't you?

Seaborn:
We have none of what you speak of.

Gladiia:
Then you have even less hope of understanding, trash. We would rather the superfluous within us and want to live on that way. We are not you.

Seaborn:
Gla-dia. Emotion. Truly such strong emotion.

Gladiia:
You can't even hope to sing. Die now.

Bishop:
Why—How could this be?

Bishop:
Why was her body able to recover from such grievous injury?!
