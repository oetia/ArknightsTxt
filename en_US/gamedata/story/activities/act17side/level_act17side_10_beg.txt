Kal'tsit:
......

Saint Carmen:
The Eye of Iberia. It's been a long, long time since I last set foot here.

Saint Carmen:
Countless soldiers from the Penal Battalion laid down their lives here. And when the Seaborn finally broke through our defense line, countless engineers died in vain inside the lighthouse.

Saint Carmen:
Before our last ship was swallowed, we fled. For every ten men who left home, hardly one returned.

Saint Carmen:
But now, behold.

Saint Carmen:
Light!

Carmen's voice trembles for the first time in an eternity.

Kal'tsit stares silently out into the center of the distant reef. A massive lighthouse illuminates the entire sky, as bright as the day.

Kal'tsit:
I don't see the ship.

Saint Carmen:
That is a good sign. It proves they found what they were looking for.

Saint Carmen:
Let's proceed. As long as this light is not extinguished, we will press forward.

Sea Terror:
(Slithers around the main door)

Kal'tsit:
...Mon3tr.

Mon3tr:
(Screeches)

Kal'tsit:
Clear the way. We're going in.

Saint Carmen:
......

The heat of fire.

The Sea Terrors gather around the main door, wandering, spinning.

Carmen's eyes sweep into the distance. They follow a line of the charred corpses of these abominations the entire way, their remains vanishing with the wind.

Saint Carmen:
The Sea Terrors do not feel fear.

Kal'tsit:
But they do know how to seek advantage and avoid disadvantage. Their base instincts have taught them to hunt cautiously.

Saint Carmen:
...They have been taught fear. These creatures may not know what a country is, let alone laws and morals.

Saint Carmen:
But they have learned to fear the High Inquisitor. They have learned to fear everything we have built on top of civilization.

Saint Carmen:
Dario!

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit does not say anything.

She can see. She can see a strange ring on a patch of fluorescent ground.

Charred corpses are stacked high into a mountain. The deaths of tens of thousands of their kin had imprinted a new behavior upon the Sea Terrors—

—Do not approach the lighthouse.

A feeble flame still flickers. It was originally a great bonfire.

Before the Sea Terrors had perished in a tide of death, there was nothing flammable here at all.

At the heart of the flame stands a single man. He lifts his lantern and leans on his sword, just as he did when he learned to stand guard in his youth—motionless.

Dario, Unspeaking:
......

Saint Carmen:
You've done well, Dario.

Saint Carmen:
Be at peace now.

The lantern in Dario's hand seems to echo Carmen's farewell. In an instant, the fire swallows even more Sea Terrors before the raging flame then wraps around the silent High Inquisitor.

His already-clouded eyes are still gazing far into the distance.

Carmen remains silent for a long time before Dario's statue-like body.

Kal'tsit does not interrupt Carmen's mourning. She only takes in the scene with her eyes. There aren't many signs of the Hunters' activity here.

The High Inquisitor remained here alone, staving off the surging tides of Sea Terrors until his life was spent.

But even if the soldier's lifeforce had bled dry long ago, the Sea Terrors still feared him. Because his flame had not extinguished, because his light had not dimmed.

The Inquisitor had turned himself into a force of nature, a pledge to defend the sanctity of the Eye of Iberia even beyond death.

After a long time, Carmen lifts his head.

Only then does Kal'tsit see the signs of age in the old man in front of her. Though the Inquisition had used various methods to prolong his life, in this moment he could no longer hide the fatigue in his eyes.

He turns his head and looks towards Kal'tsit, then back to Dario, who was gradually disappearing into the flame.

Saint Carmen:
He was my finest student, Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
We have three minutes to mourn the death of this soldier. Once the flames go out, nothing will stand between the Sea Terrors and their nest. They will swarm this place.

Kal'tsit:
Also, I didn't see the girl. At least his disciple survived.

Saint Carmen:
Are there no higher-level Seaborn here?

Kal'tsit:
Doesn't seem so, for the time being.

Saint Carmen:
Their numbers are nothing to be feared then.

Kal'tsit:
'For the time being.'

Kal'tsit:
We ought to find a more permanent solution. The Eye of Iberia was built by Breogan. It has the potential to become the hub for establishing a link with Ægir.

Saint Carmen:
Assuming they were able to find the ship... Wait, hold on.

Saint Carmen:
Who reactivated the Eye of Iberia? Neither the Ægir nor Dario should've had any experience with this.

Kal'tsit:
...Look up there.

Jordi:
Ugh... Finally...

Jordi:
*pant*... *pant*... Th-The control panel is fine...

Jordi:
Phew, I'm totally worn out...

Mon3tr:
(Hums curiously)

Jordi:
Hwaaaaah—!

Jordi:
Y-You're—

Kal'tsit:
...I must admit, you've surpassed my expectations.

Kal'tsit:
You managed to re-light the Eye of Iberia by yourself, restoring at least thirty percent of its functionality.

Kal'tsit:
You did this, alone. Under these conditions.

Jordi:
You... You're the one Mr. Elysium mentioned. Oh!

Jordi:
Wh-What about Mr. Inquisitor?! He's been fighting for his life down there this entire time and I, I didn't dare get close to him since I wouldn't be able to help anyway, so all I could do was keep an eye on the control panel here...

Saint Carmen:
He made the ultimate sacrifice.

Jordi:
What...?

Saint Carmen:
But by no means was it in vain. He sacrificed himself for his faith, and as such, will now live on forever.

Saint Carmen:
He died heroically as an Inquisitor, as a vindicator of Iberia. His ideal self shall be forever enshrined on the coasts of Iberia.

Saint Carmen:
And then there is you, Ægir. You have defended the purpose of his sacrifice. You have persisted all this time, and never given up.

Saint Carmen:
You've done well.

Jordi:
I-I never got to talk to him much, but... he... *sob*...

Jordi:
Um... what about Gran Faro? What's going to happen to my home?

Saint Carmen:
...I usually don't answer every question from the general public.

Saint Carmen:
But for now, I don't intend to lie to you. Gran Faro will soon be under the management of the Penal Battalion. The citizens will all come under their unified control, and contribute to the construction of frontline checkpoints.

Saint Carmen:
Also... Thiago died at the hands of heretics.

Jordi:
No!

Jordi:
H-How could this happen? Uncle Thiago, is he really—?!

Saint Carmen:
He had long been aware of the Church of the Deep's cultists, yet turned a blind eye to them. His cover-up thwarted the plans of the Penal Battalion, and delayed our ability to send support here.

Saint Carmen:
Even if he'd escaped death, he would not have escaped me, child.

Jordi:
......

Jordi collapses limply onto the ground.

He feels numb and exhausted. He feels like the single string supporting him through everything that happened, long worn thin, had suddenly snapped.

Jordi:
Uncle Thiago... Why?

Kal'tsit:
...Mon3tr, guard the entrance.

Mon3tr:
(Obeys cheerfully)

Saint Carmen:
Can you confirm where the Stultifera Navis was last seen?

Jordi:
......

Saint Carmen:
Dame Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
Not that far. And the last signal came less than forty-eight hours ago.

Saint Carmen:
What...?

Saint Carmen:
She's still able to send signals?

Kal'tsit:
Breogan helped the Iberian royal family construct lighthouses and fleets. Why, if not for restoring a connection to his homeland?

Kal'tsit:
Be it the Eye of Iberia or some transponder hidden in a corner in the Stultifera Navis, they all use the Ægir's technology without reservation.

Kal'tsit:
Of course, all of this assumes that the Seaborn haven't already destroyed the ship or turned it into their nest.

Carmen's eyes silently follow the direction of the light extending towards the horizon.

The Stultifera Navis cannot be seen by the naked eye. The ocean is too expansive, and what's not too far for a ship is still a cruel joke to those on land.

The weary saint once again shows his age. His lips quiver, as if innumerable thoughts are crossing through his mind.

Saint Carmen:
Alfonso... Garcia... Touré... Julia...

Saint Carmen:
Are you still out there?

Skadi:
My captain and Gladiia pursued it into the sea.

Skadi:
We should go help them.

Specter:
No, we'd be better off waiting here. The waters are restless, and the Seaborns' scents swirl together. There's probably more than just one.

Specter:
......

Specter:
Did you hear something, Skadi?

Skadi:
What? No, I didn't.

Specter:
I see.

Captain Alfonso:
What have you done to this place?!

Captain Alfonso:
You, Ægirs, how'd you get in here?

Captain Alfonso:
I was the only one with the key, and when the ol' deadbeat kicked the bucket, I threw it into the ocean! It's been fifty years already!

Skadi:
If this is the power source for the vessel, wouldn't locking it up mean giving up hope?

Captain Alfonso:
The ol' deadbeat was the last engineer we had. When he died, we had nobody left who could fix the ship.

Captain Alfonso:
To make matters worse, we were already tangled up in the Seaborn, and couldn't get away. Didn't need anyone rocking the boat on my watch.

Captain Alfonso:
But answer me! How'd you find this place?!

Specter:
Breogan. The captain followed the clues he left, which led to Iberia, then here.

Captain Alfonso:
You people... you know the shipwright?

Specter:
Nope, not at all. I've always been more into the arts anyway.

Specter:
But it really shouldn't come as a surprise. To return to Ægir, we must follow the trail of the Ægir—

Specter:
—What's this?

Captain Alfonso:
Ah, you've even gotten your hands dirty digging up some of Breogan's personal belongings... Hasn't Ægir ever heard of respecting people's privacy?

Specter:
......

Skadi:
What does it say?

Specter:
Breogan's experiences on land. A travel log, I guess?

Skadi:
Is this what the Captain's been looking for?

Specter:
No clue. Why don't you ask her yourself?

Gladiia:
...Just a small part of it.

Captain Alfonso:
Returning empty handed, eh?

Ulpianus:
It disappeared.

Ulpianus:
Furthermore, the reason we didn't chase any further is because there were signs of other Seaborn nearby.

Ulpianus:
They came here following distant scents and the calls of their kin.

Ulpianus:
Now, I don't mind skipping straight to the slaughter. But we should resolve the problem of this ship first.

Captain Alfonso:
You dare treat my Iberia as a prize to be taken?

Gladiia:
This ship is the only way for us to return to Ægir. And only it can contact our cities.

Gladiia:
As for the issue of repairs, perhaps I might be more qualified than a handful of backwards Iberians who know little of Breogan's technology.

Gladiia:
I can't pass up this opportunity, even if we must resort to force.

Skadi:
......

Specter:
......

Captain Alfonso:
Two against four, eh?

Chief Mate:
(Howls vigilantly) —

Ulpianus:
Three against three.

Skadi:
...Captain?!

Ulpianus:
Not so fast, Gladiia.

Ulpianus:
Don't forget what I said.

Gladiia:
...You never gave me a reason to give up on returning to Ægir.

Ulpianus:
I'm telling you, you don't know what it's like there now.

Ulpianus:
The Seaborn have never taken the initiative to attack our cities unless their nests and living spaces were threatened. Each act of slaughter, each act of destruction, has been fueled by the Ægir's degeneracy.

Ulpianus:
They thought we were dead. They lost contact with us. The blood of the Seaborn flow within us.

Ulpianus:
In all our long years of battling against these enemies, we finally have a prime opportunity.

Gladiia:
And you think these few acts of 'degeneracy' have nothing to do with the scum we fight? Even if left alone, the Seaborn's living spaces will grow like a tumor until the entire ocean is devoured.

Ulpianus:
This and that are two separate issues.

Ulpianus:
Neither of which can be solved by heading home, rejoining the army, and marching forth once more.

Ulpianus:
Why don't we try thinking outside the box this time?

Gladiia:
So you've chosen to listen to those lowly beasts, to walk with them, to understand them.

Ulpianus:
They call us their kin, but what do we know about them? Far too little.

Ulpianus:
I can hardly even understand what I've seen myself. Until we've obtained definite answers about their gods, everything we do is uselessly groping around in the dark.

Skadi:
What are you talking about, Captain?!

Skadi:
You... You and the Seaborn... How do we know you're still on our side? Why do you have to...

Specter:
Every Hunter who thought they could get something out of the Seaborn has ended up disappearing.

Specter:
Of course, you should understand that better than me.

Skadi:
Their whispers... resonate... They will invade your mind. Those are not your thoughts!

Ulpianus:
...Skadi.

Ulpianus:
That's... also a separate issue. I'll let Gladiia give you the specifics.

Ulpianus:
Ship captain, escort them away.

Captain Alfonso:
I was just thinking the same thing, Ægir.

Gladiia:
...What a pity.

Skadi & Specter:
......

Stillness. Silence. Hunters long separated always seem to have the least pleasant of reunions.

Something squirms in the hearts of Skadi and Specter. The chief mate hesitates, its wounds still aching.

Swords are drawn, bowstrings stretched taut.

Quiet.

Too quiet.

Wait, how is this possible? The rushing of the waves, the howling of the wind, the creaking sounds of the hull being torn open by Seaborn—

They all become distant.

Inquisitor Irene:
Hunters!

Inquisitor Irene:
Th-The ship is sailing!

Captain Alfonso:
Nonsense, Old Iberian. Just how many years do you think—

Inquisitor Irene:
No, I swear it's true! Something's pushing the ship, and... it might've been pushing the ship the whole time we were chasing after the Seaborn.

Inquisitor Irene:
And... from the very beginning, um...

Inquisitor Irene:
Our surroundings have been unusually quiet.

Rocinante:
*Huff*...

The Last Knight:
Kin, gather. Take this cell, and go far away.

The Last Knight:
Follow... We will follow. We will find the end of the storm.

Rocinante:
(Shakes head meekly)

The Last Knight:
The waves are fading.

The Last Knight:
Silence, is coming.

Captain Alfonso:
I don't hear anything at all. After so many years of the waves washing against us, why...?

Captain Alfonso:
Everything, is just like that day...

Chief Mate:
(Cowers in pain and suffering)

Captain Alfonso:
Garcia! Ugh... My hand, it's shaking... Damn it, if I didn't need it to hunt, I would've lopped this thing off a long time ago.

Captain Alfonso:
What's the meaning of this, Ægir?!

Gladiia does not answer.

She imperceptibly reaches for her neck. The scales, the part of her that do not belong to her, are resonating with something.

Gladiia:
The scent of the Seaborn... The smell of the ocean, it's all gone. Look outside. It's way too peaceful.

Gladiia:
How could this be?

Captain Alfonso:
Haah... What's going on? Why's it so quiet?

Captain Alfonso:
...Wait.

Captain Alfonso:
Did you hear that? What was that?

Captain Alfonso:
Was there something—

Inquisitor Irene:
'The ocean sank into an unprecedented silence. Anomalies appeared across the shore, as violently ebbing tides and irregular waves heralded the coming of disaster.'

Inquisitor Irene:
'All sounds were smothered. From waves crashing against the shore to the chiming of city clock towers, all noise faded away.'

Until the voices of the people all disappeared as well.

Until the wind was stilled.

The Profound Silence came without a sound.

Inquisitor Irene:
Impossible, it's just like in the Inquisition's records. Are we facing... another Silence?!

Specter:
......

Gladiia:
Shark, where are you going?

Specter:
Heading up to check things out.

Ulpianus:
I'll go with you.

Skadi:
Me too.

Ulpianus:
No, Skadi.

Ulpianus:
You and Gladiia stay here.

Gladiia:
......

Ulpianus:
...Skadi.

Skadi:
Why?

Ulpianus:
Stay with Gladiia, and remember this one thing.

Ulpianus:
You will always be our Hunter.

Ulpianus:
Laurentina, let's go.

Specter lifts her head towards the sky.

The dark clouds know not when to dissipate, but she, who has lost the concept of time, finds a sea of stars in the sky.

She can finally hear that voice.

The voice that calls out to her.

Specter paces around the deck, and Ulpianus casts her a concerned glance for just a moment.

Specter:
You and the captain have a keen sense of smell. Can you sense any Seaborn around us?

Ulpianus:
No, right now, there is little difference between here and the land.

Ulpianus:
Even though we're clearly floating out at sea. It's disconcerting.

Ulpianus:
I'll head the other way to see if we're really being pushed by a current.

Specter:
...See you soon.

Specter:
O starry sky.

Specter:
This is the first time in many years I've seen the stars so clearly.

Specter:
I had forgotten so many things. I forgot my home, was used by others, and what finally saved my life and awakened my memories was the part of me I hated most.

Specter:
Accepting that I'm a freak actually wasn't as hard as it sounds. That's what makes me unique.

Specter:
The one, final thing I am unable to let go of... is my home.

Specter:
But have I really returned? Is this place on the sea's surface really Ægir? Is this still my home?

Specter:
Just because Gladiia never said it doesn't mean I wouldn't realize. It wouldn't be the first time rifts have grown between Hunters, but between us and Ægir? We've been separated by the shore for too long.

Specter:
...I remember something else.

Specter:
When I was little, I once went with my parents and grandparents to watch the stars on the ocean's surface adorn the sky, on a day much like this. Even the most beautiful pearl geode couldn't compare to that splendor.

Specter:
In retrospect, even after I became a Hunter, I was always leaving my home again and again, but never reaching anywhere else.

Specter:
Haha... I suppose I'm getting a bit homesick.

Specter:
Where are you going to take me this time, Amaia?

Under the magnificent starry sky, the creature quietly looks down on Specter.

It makes not a single sound. The ship splitting the waves, the wind's bluster. All sounds are drowned out by His soft murmurs.

He hovers in the air as if walking on water, gently kissing the light of the stars and moons, His tentacles coruscating in a beautiful array.

Seaborn:
Nowhere, Laurentina. The ocean is boundless, and wherever we go is all the same.

Specter:
I've always been able to hear your song, Amaia.

Seaborn:
Laurentina, that is the name of our scaleless kin, the Liberi, the Iberian.

Seaborn:
As I consumed her, she kept stroking my head. She spoke to me of many things. Time itself was like frozen dust, an eternity seeming to pass as I listened to her.

Seaborn:
Until she could no longer speak, until even her bones were digested by our smallest kin, she nurtured me with both nutrition and time. She taught me everything I know.

Specter:
Since when were you so sentimental towards your food?

Seaborn:
Such was her request, I merely granted it. If there is purpose to such emotions, we are willing to experiment.

Seaborn:
What of Ishar'mla? Gladiia? And... Ulpianus?

Seaborn:
Are your kin ready to return to the great sea?

Specter:
...We've had a bit of an internal disagreement.

Seaborn:
Why? Your home is clearly right before your eyes. We many are clearly right here awaiting you.

Seaborn:
You're homesick, Laurentina. Amaia told me that, of all the Ægir she ever made contact with, you harbor the greatest affection for Ægir itself.

Seaborn:
Come.

Seaborn:
Embrace me, and I will bring you back home.

Specter:
You know, I've never touched a living Seaborn before. I prefer your kind dead.

Seaborn:
Just as you prefer to give shape to inorganic matter, even though it offers nothing for your survival?

Specter:
Do you have any other pursuits other than 'survival'?

Seaborn:
Pursuits? Like your pursuit to return home?

Seaborn:
The survival of our kind. The survival of more of us. The survival of we many.

Seaborn:
All beings ought to form a single entity. Life should not be so disorderly.

The Seaborn descends onto the deck.

Specter laughs.

Specter:
You're a graceful one. Did Amaia teach you that as well?

Seaborn:
It was just her request. A memento.

Specter:
I suppose that means you'll be paying back both of our debts?

Seaborn:
...Ah, before her death, Amaia entrusted you to me. I will make use of your life. I will also fulfill your requests.

Seaborn:
Amaia thanks you. She said I should help you. Because of you, their work was able to take another step forward. Their 'research' and 'ideals' have all advanced greatly.

Seaborn:
I can talk to you about Ishar'mla. I can take you back to Ægir. I can share with you where our kind are, and how they are doing. I can name your clansmen who are trying to become one with us.

Seaborn:
Amaia begged me to help you. Only through helping you, will you accept us as kin.

Specter:
...Hah.

Specter:
In that case, my first request is...

Specter:
Stop singing. I want to hear the wind of my hometown.

Seaborn:
Very well.

In an instant, the wind and the waves return to Specter's ears.

Just as the sound of the first waves splashing against the deck rings out clearly, Ulpianus's giant blade is already poised above the Seaborn's head.

Ulpianus:
Die.

Ulpianus:
What—?! It managed to block? —Nngh!

Specter:
Ulpianus!

Seaborn:
A sufficiently heavy blow. Our kin in the ocean will welcome his unconscious form. They will take him back to our nest, where we will spend time becoming one with him.

Seaborn:
As for this floating box... it has been used to house our kin who have not yet adapted to the sea. But most of them died, and the rest have refused to become one with us.

Seaborn:
Therefore, it is no longer needed.

Specter is unable to see the Seaborn's movements, but like a piece of garbage being swept aside by a pedestrian, the once-glorious cannon mounted on the ship vanishes in the blink of an eye.

A few seconds later, an enormous splash in the distance reveals where the steel construct had gone.

Specter:
(How did it manage to slice off that cannon? With its tail?!)

Specter:
Shit—

Specter's eyes are unable to follow.

Whether shaken by the ease with which Ulpianus was repelled, or distracted by the sound of the metal cannon being sliced through, Specter is easily struck and sent crashing into the deck.

She was unable to see the attack at all.

Seaborn:
Come, let us return to the sea.

Seaborn:
Whether to hunt, or to communicate, or to evolve, we must all return to the sea.

Inquisitor Irene:
Halt!

Captain Alfonso:
You trying to take apart my ship, you monster?!

Captain Alfonso:
Garcia!

Chief Mate:
(Roars) —!

The chief mate charges at the Seaborn.

But before even laying a finger on that elegant being, the chief mate's movements suddenly freeze.

Kin. This is kin.

I am attacking my own kind?

Chief Mate:
Guh...?!

Seaborn:
What a paradoxical being. You have consumed many of our kin, yet many more go hungry. You ought to feed them.

Seaborn:
Turn into nutrients, and nourish our kind.

Captain Alfonso:
Garcia!

Captain Alfonso:
What are you doing to my chief mate?!

Captain Alfonso:
—Ugh!

Captain Alfonso:
Gaah... Goddamnit!

Chief Mate:
......!

Captain Alfonso:
Don't worry, I'm alright... *cough*.

Chief Mate:
......

Chief Mate:
Alfonso...

Captain Alfonso:
What is it...?

Captain Alfonso:
Wait, hold on, what?! Garcia, you—

Chief Mate:
Alfonso.

Chief Mate:
Today is... the last day... of our voyage.

Chief Mate:
All these years... I... always treated myself as... a monster. Easier... that way.

Chief Mate:
I know. If I die... you'll be lonely... and then you'll die. You shouldn't... die... so I'm... worthless.

Chief Mate:
Today is the last day... of our voyage.

Chief Mate:
I... I think I already... feel kinship towards it.

Captain Alfonso:
No! No!

Captain Alfonso:
Garcia! You can still talk! You're still yourself!

Chief Mate:
No.

Chief Mate:
Time... is up. The Stultifera... will soon sink. The fluorescent sea has already started... to corrode the ship.

Chief Mate:
I—

Chief Mate:
—Will fight to the death, as an Iberian. I will never... accept it as my kin.

Seaborn:
......

The Seaborn has already bent down.

It looks hardly any different from the greatest chief mate Iberia has ever known.

Garcia nudges the shining crown sitting atop its head.

Chief Mate:
(Iberian) My beloved... Remember... your duty.

Captain Alfonso:
......

Chief Mate:
(Roars) —

Seaborn:
You are not fighting me, Garcia.

Chief Mate:
Graaaaah—

Seaborn:
You are fighting we many inside your heart. You are on this ship, but you thirst for the sea.

Chief Mate:
Urgh— Hraaaagh—

Seaborn:
But it doesn't matter.

Seaborn:
Become sustenance, and nourish our kin. Or, become one with us.

The Chief Mate's body is punctured, blood gushing out like a spring.

The Seaborn tosses Garcia overboard into the ocean, like chucking out bait.

It gazes from above, noble and impassive, like an inviolable eikon.

Inquisitor Irene:
What... What just happened?

Inquisitor Irene:
How could it so easily—

Seaborn:
Human, kin, and all living things in between.

Seaborn:
Amaia wishes to correct you. And thus, it shall be done. I simply welcome back my kin, and welcome back Ishar-mla.

Seaborn:
Protect the lives of our kin. Then, return to we many. 'Return home.'

Gladiia:
Shark.

Skadi & Specter:
—

Gladiia effortlessly steps forward, casting off the gentle beckoning from behind.

In the space of a moment, Skadi, who had been standing behind her, and Specter, once again returning to battle, react in sync and brandish their weapons at the Seaborn.

As the fastest of the group, Gladiia would improve the synergy between the three if she slowed down a bit—but she had already lost the capacity to stay calm.

Seaborn:
......

It dodges. Or more accurately, it simply takes a step forward, but its speed is sufficient.

It has its eyes only on Skadi.

Seaborn:
There are many among us who wish to see you. Ishar-mla. Ishar'mla.

Skadi:
—!

Seaborn:
Our kind awaits you. We await you. We hope you will answer our call.

Gladiia:
Filth, is there no end to your arrogance?

Gladiia whirls her lance at the Seaborn, but it does not evade. It is run through, its body easily lifted and smashed down into a deep pit.

Seaborn:
......

Gladiia:
No good... What's happened to your body?

Seaborn:
Soon, many kin, many kin in need, will reach my heights.

Seaborn:
We are changing every day. Gladiia. We are one whole. You are of the strongest batch.

Skadi:
...Where's my captain?

Specter:
Tossed into the sea. He was injured pretty badly.

Skadi:
......

Gladiia:
Even their gods were unable to devour Ulpianus. He won't die so easily.

Gladiia:
Its body seems to have undergone some changes. It's nothing like the trash we encountered in Sal Viento.

Specter:
Swordfish? Treating an enemy with caution rather than contempt? Maybe I'm still missing some memories, but does that ever happen, Skadi?

Skadi:
No, you're right, it is rare. But Seaborn like this were also rare. What kind of prey stands before three Hunters and remains unscathed?

Specter:
To be fair, I've barely done anything yet.

Skadi:
The ship won't hold out if we keep fighting like this, though. It's grown much stronger.

Captain Alfonso:
...Just the last few blows have already set the lowest deck on fire.

Captain Alfonso:
How dare you treat Garcia and my ship like this! I'll make you regret this, monster.

Seaborn:
......

Seaborn:
Please, my kin, even more of our kin call out to me, asking me to maintain the ocean's growth and tranquility.

Seaborn:
If you get in my way, I have no choice but to consume you. I beg of you, return to our kind.

Specter:
Hey, Amaia.

Seaborn:
...If you insist on calling me that.

Specter:
Sure do. Anyway, I just remembered something which REALLY should've been written into those Scriptures—

Seaborn:
What?

Specter:
