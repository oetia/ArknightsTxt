Maria:
*yawn*... Is it morning already?

Maria:
The operators' equipment was a lot more seriously damaged than we anticipated... Still, the fact that they managed to save so many people from that Catastrophe is a testament to how amazing they are.

Maria:
Mhm. I've got to chin up as well.

Grani:
Hi Maria, I'm here to pick up an order from the Engineering Department.

Maria:
Oh, Grani! Just a moment. Let's see... where did I put that? Sorry, I haven't tidied this place up for a few days, so it's a bit of a dump.

Grani:
Ahaha... It sure looks more like a proper Kazimierzian workshop than the last time I stopped by. Huh? What's this?

Grani:
A novel?

Maria:
'The Last Knight'! What's that doing here? Did it get stuck underneath the blueprints when I was flipping through my boxes and drawers yesterday? I was wondering where it had gone.

Grani:
'The Last Knight'?

Maria:
It used to be my favorite book. My sister gave it to me as a gift when I was little.

Grani:
A knight novel from Kazimierz, huh?

Grani:
Mind lending it to me?

Maria:
Sure thing!

Maria:
Ugh, so that's where the book on Arts Unit theory ended up... Sorry Grani, this might take a while. I can bring it over to you later, if you like.

Grani:
Don't worry, it's not urgent. Just means I get to stay on Rhodes Island a bit longer this time.

Grani:
I'll just be over here reading, to pass the time.

Maria:
I'm really, really sorry about this.

Grani:
......

'The Last Knight.'

The title is as pompous as it is cliché. There have probably been hundreds of books written about the last knight, the swiftest knight, or the strongest knight.

But seeing how the Radiant Knight gifted it to her own sister, surely there must be more to it than that?

With that thought, Grani opens it up, only to find a bookmark wedged inside.

Written in wobbly Kazimierzian letters is a line that may well have been copied from the book.

Grani:
'If you deem the waves too raucous, then command the ocean to be still.' Huh...?

Legend has it that the Last Knight returned to Iberia. The enemies reflected in his eyes were not living creatures, but rather, he charged at the mountains, the cities, and the waves.

Legend has it that the Last Knight settled by the coast, sustaining himself on the wind and taking shelter in the mist, until at last he forgot how to remove his helmet.

Legend has it that the Last Knight finally disappeared after clashing against the great waves. His family discovered what he'd left behind along the shore and brought it back to the Land of Knights, burying it deep in the mountains.

Legend has it that his or her story was brought to light by a poet. Embellished, sung, given both meaning and symbolism. And in this form, they did finally return to the Land of Knights, as a highly controversial figure.

However...

...There are some who believe that the mad knight triumphed over the ocean, over time, over death itself. That his quest continues until the end of all things.

???:
......

???:
............

Gladiia:
What... are you?

???:
......

The knight does not answer. His deathly gaze is fixed on Gladiia.

However, she quickly realizes that he is not actually looking at her.

He stares only at the key in her hands.

???:
Guh... *cough* *cough*... Hiss...

The knight opens his mouth as if to speak. But only a shriveled rasp comes forth, like the sound of muscle tearing.

He begins to take a step forward.

Saint Carmen:
Where did you get that key?

Kal'tsit:
......

Saint Carmen:
Oh, I did not intend to... pry into Rhodes Island's internal affairs.

Saint Carmen:
But that is Breogan's legacy, passed through the hands of the four Feranmuts to once again return to that Abyssal Hunter.

Kal'tsit:
By pure coincidence, one of the Hunters found it in Kazimierz.

Saint Carmen:
...Kazimierz? What a distant land. I still remember journeying with my mentor to receive an envoy from the Land of Knights, and secretly overhearing a few Silverlance campaign knights describing their ideals.

Saint Carmen:
I hear the country has changed considerably since then.

Kal'tsit:
For better or worse, every political entity has undergone similar changes in our current era. But that has nothing to do with Iberia.

Saint Carmen:
We are like ensnared beasts. Should we struggle, we suffer and bleed. Should we give up, our lives are forfeit.

Saint Carmen:
Before we unmask those still-human traitors, I have a new question for you, Kal'tsit.

Saint Carmen:
No doubt you've already realized this, but that child couldn't possibly be Breogan's descendant. The Inquisition would not have missed such a vital clue.

Saint Carmen:
So why would you still condemn him to a meaningless death?

Sea Terror:
(Calls out to its kin with a slithering sound)

Inquisitor Irene:
High Inquisitor!

High Inquisitor Dario:
...Their numbers are increasing. But, none of them showed up until we reached the lighthouse.

Jordi:
S-Sir, I've found a way to open the main door!

Jordi:
But the Eye of Iberia's core facilities are at the top of the tower. And it's very, very tall! The lift mechanism isn't working either, so we can only get up there by foot!

Sea Terror:
(Slithering sounds)

Inquisitor Irene:
High Inquisitor, we need more time!

High Inquisitor Dario:
Take the Ægir with you.

High Inquisitor Dario:
There is no time to spare, Irene.

Inquisitor Irene:
Aye! Right away!

Jordi:
Wait, hold on!

Sea Terror:
(Intense slithering sounds)

Sea Terror:
—!

High Inquisitor Dario:
Oh, are they here? No, the lantern's flames are flickering. Something has stepped into my Arts' domain.

Sea Terror:
(Cowering slithering sounds)

High Inquisitor Dario:
(They're scared. Strange, these things have never shown signs of fear before.)

High Inquisitor Dario:
(Confusion then? But what could be the cause...?)

Sea Terror:
(Confused slithering sounds)

High Inquisitor Dario:
......

The High Inquisitor raises his lantern high, and the Sea Terror in turn retreats into the shadows of the reef.

When he looks around once more, he notices the reef is littered with corroded and broken weapons, soaked with the fresh blood of monsters.

Arms belonging to the Inquisition. As his mentor Carmen had said, it is not as if the Inquisition had never considered reclaiming the sole remaining lighthouse.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Being unaffected by the Profound Silence, it's been quite well-preserved.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Even so, the Inquisition has never made a serious attempt to retrieve its own Eye following the Profound Silence.

High Inquisitor Dario:
This place used to be a spectacular overlook. A breathtaking, unobstructed view of the entire city.

High Inquisitor Dario:
It had been manned by Iberians, day in, day out.

Sea Terror:
(Cautious slithering sounds)

High Inquisitor Dario:
But you've taken it as a feeding ground, building a nest for your spawn without permission.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Hup...

Emotions.

Long-lost emotions.

From soldier to Inquisitor, and finally to one who sees the truth. He has been tempered, lost and reforged anew countless times. And thus, Dario became one of the few High Inquisitors in Iberia.

Only a single word separates an Inquisitor from a High Inquisitor, but that single word is the difference between heaven and earth.

He used to regard himself as resolute as steel. Before Iberia's enemies, his lantern would flicker, his sabre would glimmer, and every line of the Scriptures would be put into practice.

But now, he feels a type of strong emotion welling up within him. One not solely a product of the law and justice that is preached.

After acknowledging its rationality, High Inquisitor Dario accepts the fact that he is truly experiencing grief and anger. His handcannon takes aim at the Sea Terror, yet his eyes are directed towards the sea.

High Inquisitor Dario:
When you die, mankind may thrive.

High Inquisitor Dario:
These words are not a part of our laws or scriptures, but rather yours. 'Survival of the fittest.'

Jordi:
Right here!

Jordi:
It's just as the records say! The lighthouse relies on the power source located at its base, and the core column is divided into several areas. The console on this floor controls—

Inquisitor Irene:
...Controls what?

Jordi:
Uhh, signal recording.

Inquisitor Irene:
We should be able to put that to use later. But for now, we need to prioritize powering the entire lighthouse. Let's continue.

Inquisitor Irene:
Hopefully all goes well until reinforcements arrive.

Inquisitor Irene:
Ugh—!

Jordi:
What's wrong, Doña Irene?

Inquisitor Irene:
...It's nothing. Probably just my imagination. Maestro... the High Inquisitor is keeping guard outside. We'll be fine.

Jordi:
A-Alright... After we restart the lighthouse's power system, we should be able to use the lift as well. That way the others will be able to catch up to us soon enough.

Jordi:
So let's hurry!

Inquisitor Irene:
......

The Last Knight:
......

Skadi:
There's something odd about him. Some kind of... lingering scent.

Gladiia:
But what is it?

Skadi:
The scent of another land. Nothing you'd be interested in.

Gladiia:
He is without a doubt a Seaborn. But not the same as Quintus.

Gladiia:
How is it possible for so many land creatures to become Seaborn though? They shouldn't have frequent contact with the ocean.

The Last Knight:
......

Gladiia:
With no way to communicate, we can do nothing but let his body lose all function.

Skadi:
He's about to attack!

The knight suddenly seems to vanish in place. But for the senses of an Abyssal Hunter, catching him is hardly a challenge at all.

With his speed, he opts not to attack them, but instead leaps high into the air and bounds toward the lighthouse with a ferocious roar.

The Last Knight:
Graaaaaagh!

Jordi:
Woah... Wh-What was that?

Inquisitor Irene:
Don't panic! Keep climbing!

Inquisitor Irene:
Complete our mission: rekindle this lighthouse!

Jordi:
R-Right!

Inquisitor Irene:
(These vibrations... Are the walls coming under attack? How is that possible? We're already dozens of meters above ground. Do the Sea Terrors have some sort of cannon?)

Inquisitor Irene:
(Or... maybe some massive creature? But other than the tremor just now, I haven't noticed anything else.)

Inquisitor Irene:
(Maestro...!)

The Last Knight:
......

The knight lifts his head and looks up. The lighthouse did not budge an inch.

He shakes his twisted weapon disapprovingly. This long spear, once the creation of a master craftsman, is now inundated with the scent of the depths.

He does not see the one standing in his way. The knight bends his knees again, intending to try once more.

The Last Knight:
—!

High Inquisitor Dario:
What are you doing?

The Last Knight:
......

High Inquisitor Dario:
You contemptuously provoke Iberia, trespass upon restricted areas, and damage a precious heritage site.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Just look at yourself. Do you have even a single shred of human-born dignity left in you?

The Last Knight:
......

The Last Knight:
...Dig...nity...?

High Inquisitor Dario:
Seems your vocal chords still work at least.

The Last Knight:
(Unintelligible sounds) ...The sea... doesn't need.

The Last Knight:
Crush... the waves. Trample the sun. End the pain.

The Last Knight:
Things should not, remain the same. The great tree, takes root in this land.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Your stance. Your gray armor. And that spear.

High Inquisitor Dario:
You're from Kazimierz?

The Last Knight:
I am... I am...

High Inquisitor Dario:
......

The Last Knight:
Knight!

The Last Knight:
...Slithering steel... Ocean's waves...

High Inquisitor Dario:
(Lifting the lantern won't do anything. There's no sign of any other ships coming.)

High Inquisitor Dario:
(The fluorescent nethersea brand ignored him. He may well be the source of the Sea Terrors' panic.)

High Inquisitor Dario:
(Then... is he actually a Seaborn disguised as a human?)

High Inquisitor Dario:
You seek to destroy the Eye of Iberia? The Inquisition will not allow it.

The Last Knight:
Aaaaaargh, the soil—!

High Inquisitor Dario:
Now!

Specter:
...Good evening, Mister Knight.

The Last Knight:
—?!

High Inquisitor Dario:
Where are the other two?

Specter:
The others? They're... currently having a little chat with Mister Knight's friends.

High Inquisitor Dario:
So a fight broke out not far away. Seems like it's a clash of civilizations then.

Specter:
It has nothing to do with me, though, so I came over here.

High Inquisitor Dario:
You... You're different from how you were back in Sal Viento.

High Inquisitor Dario:
And also from how you were when we met in Gran Faro. You're always changing.

Specter:
The seawater is sobering. Even the slightest breath of air brought in by the ocean breeze.

Specter:
Although... I do want to return to the sea's embrace, but Skadi stopped me.

Specter:
My little Skadi. She's so scared... But of what?

High Inquisitor Dario:
......

The Last Knight:
......

High Inquisitor Dario:
With what's going on right now, I need Gladiia's explanation all the more.

Specter:
(Ægirian) Mister Knight, good sir, return to your sweet slumber, deep in the abyss.

Specter:
(Ægirian) We are not enemies.

The knight ignores Laurentina, who murmurs as if singing.

As for the 'enemy' who'd just dealt him a heavy blow, the knight only tilts his head slightly before quickly snapping his attention back to the towering lighthouse.

Specter:
Alas, how tragic. Language can no longer reach your ears, just as those clouds cover your eyes.

Specter:
Even in your madness, does your will still drive you forward like clockwork, compelling your body to advance?

The Last Knight:
......

Specter:
Come then, storm.

Specter:
Let us share this dance.

Jordi:
I've found it! The main control panel!

Inquisitor Irene:
How's it looking?

Jordi:
I, I'm not too sure. This is more complicated than what's on the diagrams, and, uh, I've never actually operated these things before.

Jordi:
That sound again... What's going on outside?

Inquisitor Irene:
Perhaps we're still underestimating the dangers we might encounter here. At this rate, holding out for the Penal Battalion's technicians might be...

Inquisitor Irene:
No, even if reinforcements arrive, the sacrifices required to repair the lighthouse under these conditions are akin to setting up camp under the crosshairs of a high-speed warship.

Inquisitor Irene:
Jordi, you're a civilian, and a part of Iberia. For now, I won't ask where you came from, or about what happened in Gran Faro's past.

Inquisitor Irene:
We're in a race against time. Right now, this instant, try your best to get all the information out of the Eye of Iberia as you can. Maestro and I will protect this tower, and we—

Jordi:
A-All right... I've managed to retrieve the logs. The panel is still responding, and the energy module underneath the tower is still functional.

Inquisitor Irene:
...You act fast. Commendable.

Inquisitor Irene:
What's next? How long would it take to reboot the entire lighthouse?

Jordi:
I, I'll see what I can do!

Jordi:
Um... Even though I know the people out there are fighting against those sea monsters, I still have to say this!

Jordi:
As long as the panel is still responding, it shouldn't be too hard to restart it. I've read about this in the notes my parents left behind... B-But, this would be my first time actually operating something like this, so it's still a bit of a gamble!

Jordi:
Either way, it all takes time! We should probably—

Jordi:
Eek—!

Inquisitor Irene:
Guard this place, right?

Inquisitor Irene:
Don't look down. Keep moving forward.
