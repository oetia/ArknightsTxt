I see it.

I see Alfonso heading to the great hall every day. He's named it 'Iberia.'

He's moved the mirror from his bedroom to the hall, and spends day after day examining himself.

Ever since the head chef and young Jamie were executed, he and I are the only ones left.

Chief Mate:
......

Captain Alfonso:
There you are.

Captain Alfonso:
How long was I asleep? Feels like I barely got any rest before I found myself awake.

Chief Mate:
Uhh... Not long... But...

Captain Alfonso:
No need to force yourself. I know it hurts when you talk.

Captain Alfonso:
These lowly monsters leave plenty of blood behind, so let's use that to write instead.

I nod. In the corner are buckets, filled with the blood of our quarry.

Captain Alfonso:
Time passes too slowly. I barely slept at all, but my dreams felt even longer than all the decades behind us...

Captain Alfonso:
Is it time we gave up then? It's been a long, long while since young Jamie and the old chef left us. Should we follow them?

We should give up.

My consciousness blurs more and more, like the feeling of being entangled right before waking from a dream.

It is not just my flesh that is changing, but everything about me. Everything that makes me a living being.

We should give up. We should end ourselves before we're devoured. The infinite, boundless ocean. The sea breeze. The waves. The whispers.

Captain Alfonso:
...Chief Mate, this is our ship. Our ideals.

Captain Alfonso:
Sooner or later, we'll lose even the strength to walk. But that won't happen to her. Not the Stultifera Navis.

Captain Alfonso:
That cigar-chomping engineer was right. Even if we all die, this ship will never sink.

Captain Alfonso:
Today... is just another twenty-four hours in one long, unending day.

Chief Mate:
... (Scrawls some words using the blood of Sea Terrors)

Captain Alfonso:
Don't... give up?

Captain Alfonso:
Hah! Look at what you've become. I can't even see your sea-blue eyes anymore. Wouldn't you rather be set free?

Chief Mate:
(Scrawls) I am your chief mate.

Captain Alfonso:
......

Chief Mate:
For... your sake...

Captain Alfonso:
Hush, easy now.

Captain Alfonso:
Thank you, Garcia. No matter what you turn into, the bond between us will never change.

Chief Mate:
(Nods)

But I know. He is looking at the mirror. Because even someone as strong as him... has finally succumbed to the monsters.

We have consumed their flesh and blood. At first, we started fires to cook them. Then, we were forced to devour them raw.

Even the most powerful Inquisitors were awed by Alfonso's strength. He was the object of so many young sailors' admiration. There was nothing he couldn't do.

But he has held on long enough. Soon, he too will become one of the monsters.

He is worried. He is furious.

If he cannot even tolerate the slightest monster within him, how can he tolerate me?

Gladiia:
Trash. You're worth even less than the weed that washed ashore in Sal Viento. That woman was merely creating a smokescreen.

Gladiia:
The ocean boasts no changes to speak of.

Seaborn:
......Gla-dia......

Seaborn:
...I want to see. Are you free?

Gladiia:
......

Seaborn:
Friends are here. They are trapped. Need help. Should be returned to our kin's embrace.

Seaborn:
Many friends have died here. But Parents. Will not let them die. I must save them.

Gladiia:
Even if you can speak with that ugly mug of yours, that's no surprise to anyone.

Seaborn:
Return to the great sea. No need to fight.

Seaborn:
We go, together—

Gladiia:
I've already grown tired of your prattling. Time to end you.

Seaborn:
...Gla-dia, will you prey on me?

Seaborn:
If you feed on me, will that make you stronger? More full of life?

Seaborn:
Will it help the scales on your neck grow and spread, and return you to your proper form?

Gladiia:
—!

Seaborn:
I sever... this flesh. Consume it.

Seaborn:
If you need more, I give you more. I will give you everything.

Gladiia stares blankly at the fleshy mass on the ground.

She is shaken.

But not because of the Seaborn, or its behavior.

However, this moment of distraction convinces the Seaborn that Gladiia has accepted its proposal.

Seaborn:
...We will meet again soon.

The Seaborn leaves, the Gladiia does not pursue it.

Because she smells the scents of Shark and Skadi. The Seaborn will not escape.

She turns around, and heads towards where another smell is coming from.

Gladiia:
The smell of the sea... and of blood. The smell of Hunters. Aboard the ship? And I didn't notice it until I got this close?

Gladiia:
Impossible!

Inquisitor Irene:
What... What do we do now?

Skadi:
Never expected there'd be people alive here. I thought we'd get the ship back just by killing some Sea Terrors. The Captain made it sound so simple.

Specter:
......

Skadi:
What are you looking at, Specter?

Specter:
The mirror.

Specter:
Did you know, Skadi? Even as we speak, when I look at myself in this mirror, I start to remember so many things that I'd forgotten.

Specter:
A darkened dome. A hundred-meter tall sculpture. An aquamarine-colored opera hall. A waterfall pouring crystals of ice. What is this place, Skadi?

Skadi:
...Your home.

Specter:
My home... I remember now.

Specter:
Writhing flesh climbing all over that statue. It collapses with a thunderous thud.

Specter:
I remember these things, but... But I've never experienced them.

Skadi:
Dunno. I only know it from hearing you talk about where you used to live, which fell into ruin long ago. Long before I met you.

Skadi:
Maybe you only saw the report later on.

Inquisitor Irene:
Can we save the chatter for some other time?!

Inquisitor Irene:
Were we planning to chase down those two Seaborn, or are we seizing control of the ship while they're not around and, uh, sailing it back?

Specter:
If the survivors haven't managed it in sixty years, somehow I doubt we could figure it out ourselves.

Specter:
Just be patient. The squad leader will figure something out... Ugh.

Skadi:
Specter! What's wrong?

Specter:
Just... a little dizzy.

Specter:
I just remembered... what they did to me. I...

Specter:
Wait.

Specter:
I saw her just now in Gran Faro...?

Specter:
She was willing to talk to me. She was full of hypocrisy, blowing hot and cold, but she...

Specter:
She's here.

Inquisitor Irene:
What... You mean more survivors?

Skadi:
No, an enemy. One who can cross the sea and board this vessel, which is more than enough to identify them.

Skadi:
Let's split up. Where will you go?

Inquisitor Irene:
I...

Inquisitor Irene:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
I am an Iberian Inquisitor. It is my duty to ensure that this ship returns to Iberia's hands.

Inquisitor Irene:
I'll go after that— after Alfonso!

Sea Terror:
(Slithers away hastily)

Chief Mate:
Gahh—!

Captain Alfonso:
Oh, don't you worry, Garcia. We'll catch up soon enough.

Captain Alfonso:
When those ignorant Ægirs wounded it, it went up through Victoria, and past Bolívar. From there, it could only climb up onto the deck, then dive into the sea.

Captain Alfonso:
This ship is not at its beck and call.

Captain Alfonso:
...Leithanien. When we were young, we visited that country along with some other officers. Do you still remember?

Captain Alfonso:
The twisted faces of those Kurfürsten were enough to turn stomachs. But they understood how to respect Arts, which was a mind-boggling revelation...

Chief Mate:
Hmm...?

Captain Alfonso:
Today's been a good day. We saw quite a few living people. Hope they get out quickly though.

Captain Alfonso:
Go. Go to 'Leithanien,' Garcia. Go play the scores you used to love so much.

Captain Alfonso:
Breathe some life into the hunt, my love.

Chief Mate:
(Nods)

Seaborn:
—!

Chief Mate:
Hrgh—!

Seaborn:
You, are not scaleless. Do you need food?

Sea Terror:
(Encircling slithering sounds)

Seaborn:
Sufficient nutrition. But these waters, are still incomplete. The Cycle has not yet been built, and living things die in vain.

Seaborn:
We must hurry—

Seaborn:
—Why? Hunting, meaningless. There is something we must do, a duty to our kin.

Captain Alfonso:
How many does that make now? Lost track after ten. When'd you monsters learn how to talk?

Captain Alfonso:
Ohh... No, I remember you, little one. When we ate your parents, you and your litter were nearby, watching.

Captain Alfonso:
Back then, you were the weakest of the lot. Pathetic runt.

Alfonso laughs as he pokes at the Seaborn's wound, blood running along the tip of his blade and dripping onto the floor.

Seaborn:
We are bound by blood. You hunt and eat us, you will become us. Just as our Parents hunted you, and then became hunted by you.

Captain Alfonso:
If the right conditions can trigger your evolution, then how do we make you more palatable? Your flesh, that is.

Seaborn:
To hunt is to survive. There is no good or evil in the hunt.

Captain Alfonso:
That's too bad then.

Gladiia:
The scent trail... ends here.

Gladiia:
He led me here. This smell...

Gladiia:
......

Gladiia does not search for the Hunter's whereabouts.

She begins to look around her.

Ever since she boarded this vessel, her surroundings have filled her with a sense of nostalgia—the materials, the decorations, the handiwork.

Breogan, a genius from the Academy of Sciences, was an Ægir. Without a doubt, this was his domain.

The mystery behind why this ship hadn't sunk in decades was itself the message Breogan wanted to leave to the Ægir. A brand new fusion of Originium and terrestrial technologies.

But what exactly is it?

Gladiia grasps the key from her bosom.

She sizes up her surroundings.

Gladiia:
Breogan... Where did you hide your secrets?

Inquisitor Irene:
(Why would this ship be built like a palace?! Most of it is decorative, and there are even sculptures.)

Inquisitor Irene:
(No, that's not all. Both the sculptures and the patterned carpets have been cleaned. Even under these conditions?)

(The sound of music wafts in from the distance)

Inquisitor Irene:
...Someone's playing the piano?

Inquisitor Irene:
It's coming from over here!

Inquisitor Irene:
......!

Irene's footsteps slow down.

At the end of the corridor, through a crack in the door, she sees—

—A single Seaborn, slapping away at a dilapidated old piano.

Inquisitor Irene:
(It's that Seaborn that was next to Alfonso! But what is it doing here?)

Chief Mate:
(Cheerfully slaps at the piano)

Inquisitor Irene:
Ugh, what a ruckus... It's just pounding away at the keyboard with no rhyme or reason.

Inquisitor Irene:
(Alfonso isn't here... Did he go after the Seaborn? Why is his chief mate here alone then?)

Inquisitor Irene:
(Well, I won't worry about it for now.)

Inquisitor Irene:
—What?

Inquisitor Irene:
(That melody just now, was that a coincidence? It certainly looks like it's only randomly smashing the keys.)

Inquisitor Irene:
(No... It stopped?)

Chief Mate:
......

Chief Mate:
...The seashore... O, the seashore...

Chief Mate:
Farewell to heroes... and... great men...

Inquisitor Irene:
—

Chief Mate:
—! Hiss...!

The Chief Mate turns its head in fear. Fear. Fear is what Irene sees in its behavior.

A massive, inexplicable physical reaction. One that's never been displayed in front of a Hunter before.

Inquisitor Irene:
Just now, you weren't just randomly hitting keys...?

Inquisitor Irene:
That... passage you played. An Iberian military song...? You... how?

Chief Mate:
Urgh...!

Chief Mate:
......

Chief Mate:
.........

Chief Mate:
You...

Inquisitor Irene:
Y-You're still conscious? Do you still have memories of being human? Do you know who you are?

Inquisitor Irene:
But, no... You're already fully transformed. The Inquisition has dealt with cultists like that before. There's no reversing it.

Chief Mate:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
Wh-What are you planning? What are you doing with your hand?!

Chief Mate:
(Carefully places its hand atop Irene's head)

Inquisitor Irene:
What... What is the meaning of this?

Chief Mate:
......

Through the scraps of cloth reminiscent of a wedding veil, the Seaborn known as the chief mate watches Irene.

Its pupils are cloudy. It is suffering. It—

—is filled with both affection and nostalgia.

Inquisitor Irene:
You... If you truly retain a shred of your humanity...

Inquisitor Irene:
But how, after all these years...?

Chief Mate:
—!

Chief Mate:
Cap... tain...

Inquisitor Irene:
Wh-What's happening?!

Inquisitor Irene:
Wait!

Seaborn:
Hunt, feed. But that is not what you are doing. Your goal is constantly changing. Shaking. Yes, shaking.

Captain Alfonso:
Tch.

Captain Alfonso:
You should just keep playing your piano, Garcia. You don't need to be touching these—

Chief Mate:
(Lightly shakes head)

Captain Alfonso:
...Hah.

Captain Alfonso:
Then sink your teeth into it. Its body is changing. Finish it now.

Seaborn:
You are... not hungry.

Seaborn:
Why?

Alfonso doesn't answer the Seaborn's question. He simply chops and hacks at it again and again, like meat on a cutting board.

The chief mate bites down on the Seaborn in a death grip. Its crown falls to the ground during the struggle, but it does not care to pick it up.

Alfonso cuts off the Seaborn's tentacles, which join the crown on the ground. The chief mate pauses for a moment.

Ah... Garcia, Garcia.

Look at your crown, and at that tentacle. Do you understand what you've become now?

Seaborn:
...Leave. We will meet again.

Captain Alfonso:
Garcia!

Chief Mate:
—!

The chief mate lifts its head, but the Seaborn has already vanished without a trace.

It quietly picks up its crown, and places it back on its head before returning to Alfonso's side. As if apologizing, it gently rubs his hand.

Captain Alfonso:
...Are you hurt, my good chief mate? Or were you distracted by our uninvited guests?

Chief Mate:
......

The chief mate does not answer.

It dares not speak. It dares not say that when it was biting down into the enemy, it felt like it was 'tearing into its own kin.'

It dares not speak, and after once again realizing what it has become, it begins to feel guilt.

Captain Alfonso:
...If you still have room for emotions in your heart, then that is proof enough that you're still human. Remember young Jamie's last words? 'I have no remorse, no regrets, and no fear.'

Captain Alfonso:
Only when you truly feel nothing will you lose the right to call yourself human.

Captain Alfonso:
Don't worry. The next hunt will be quick, and as always, it WILL return.

Chief Mate:
...... (Nods)

Captain Alfonso:
What's wrong?

Chief Mate:
(Lightly shakes head)

Amaia:
Herald.

Seaborn:
...Kin. Scaleless?

Amaia:
You are badly wounded. A newborn like you should not have been in a hurry to board this ship.

Seaborn:
Kin are here. In need of help.

Amaia:
Indeed, true enough. But you've been hurt. Though they are kin, they do not welcome you.

Amaia:
They have not yet accepted their identity. They are still lost and confused.

Seaborn:
Accept? Identity?

Amaia:
...You do not need to understand. These waters are still incomplete. Perhaps you will have to further perfect yourself before you can lead our entire kind.

Seaborn:
Need time. And nutrition.

Amaia:
And I've come to give you both.

Amaia:
That blasphemous sea captain slaughtered Sea Terrors for food, but used every means available to hinder the transformation. He's usurped pieces of the Cycle, yet refuses to be a part of it.

Amaia:
The flesh and blood of those offspring rightfully belonged to you. Those nutrients were meant to be yours. This ship has delayed the birth of a brand new ecosystem.

Amaia:
Please do not abandon me, Herald. In due time, all of Terra will become one and the same with the Nest.

Seaborn:
......

Seaborn:
I do not abandon. Kin.

Seaborn:
I need time. But not much more.

Seaborn:
I will be back. We will meet again.

Amaia:
I could have sworn you were going to rush over and kill us.

Amaia:
Should I be thanking you, Ulpianus?

Ulpianus:
I can kill something like whenever I want. It's even weaker than Quintus.

Amaia:
How patient of you.

Ulpianus:
Gladiia also tried to infiltrate the Church of the Deep in Sal Viento, hoping to get something out of them. Of course, she was a poor fit, given her personality.

Amaia:
And here I was thinking that none of you were a good fit. Or are you saying you're special?

Amaia:
You're getting less and less tight-lipped of late.

Ulpianus:
......

Amaia:
Heh. I suppose there's really no rhyme or reason for when you decide to keep quiet, Ulpianus.

Ulpianus:
Don't use my given name so casually, Liberi. You don't understand the weight behind it.

Ulpianus:
We are enemies.

Amaia:
Oh, we both know you've already abandoned that notion, deep in your heart. Of course, you might still hold some 'enmity.'

Amaia:
Like a lost and famished traveler who stumbles on a frozen, starving mangler-beast in the mountains.

Ulpianus:
......

Amaia:
Did whatever Breogan left behind satisfy your imagination?

Ulpianus:
Far from it.

Ulpianus:
The Seaborn have existed for even longer than the Ægir. For their history to be turned upside-down, there must be something behind it.

Ulpianus:
If you care about the word of God, then so be it. The Seaborn are not gods, nor are their forefathers.

Ulpianus:
I have seen how your gods die, their screams coursing through the currents, their flesh and blood smeared across abyssal ravines. As the clan hovered overhead, I plunged into the unknown depths of Ægir's territory.

Ulpianus:
I've seen it with my own eyes. Enough to shatter all the beliefs I'd held thus far. Afterwards, I will rebuild it. Ægir will be lifted up once more.
