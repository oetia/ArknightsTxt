Saint Carmen:
Exactly as the reports say. Such a curious creature.

Mon3tr:
(Growls in warning)

Saint Carmen:
Easy now, no need to get excited. Seems you understand human speech.

Gladiia:
There are parasites living on these Sea Terrors, but I've never seen them on land before.

Saint Carmen:
The Iberians call it the 'Nethersea Brand.'

Saint Carmen:
An eerie glow has been occasionally seen off the coast of Iberia since the Profound Silence, the earliest known instance dating back to 17 years ago.

Saint Carmen:
Our scientists believe it to be some sort of algal bloom.

Saint Carmen:
So, have the Ægir also encountered these... unsettling things?

Gladiia:
Seldom, but the Academy's garden has no shortage of luminescent ornamental plants.

Saint Carmen:
So the Ægir do know what the word 'ornamental' means.

Gladiia:
Nethersea brand. An apt name. It is the sea leaving its mark on the land.

Gladiia:
At its heart, its spread is no different from the Sea Terrors we saw at Sal Viento.

Saint Carmen:
Do you mean to say this phenomenon is but another form of their evolution?

Gladiia:
I see the biologists of Iberia are lacking in many ways.

Saint Carmen:
We've encountered some complications, but this is far from the worst-case scenario.

Saint Carmen:
The Inquisition has noted an alarming increase in the variety of Sea Terrors.

Saint Carmen:
Most notably at Coastline 3, where after a mere four or five days our enemies were unrecognizable.

Kal'tsit:
As I said, the ocean encroaches upon the land in its own way.

Kal'tsit:
Now, there's an operator from Rhodes Island I must rescue.

Gladiia:
I'll accompany you.

Kal'tsit:
No, it'll be more expedient for you to work with the Hunters to eliminate the threat as quickly as possible.

Gladiia:
I'd assumed Iberia would treat her with more caution.

Saint Carmen:
Indeed she should be, but for now we have a clearer enemy to deal with.

Saint Carmen:
What will you do, consul of Ægir? Continue to bicker over your country's pride?

Gladiia:
Ten minutes. I'll take care of everything and meet up with my Hunters.

Gladiia:
Then, we can talk about how to reach that lighthouse.

Saint Carmen:
I'll remain here then. Law has been absent from this chapel for far too long, but thankfully someone has been polishing it.

Saint Carmen:
It will be the only light in this war. The Iberian Inquisition is here, even if it is I alone.

Thiago:
Hey, what's going on?

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
Thiago! Where were you?

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
The Church of the Deep's cultists appeared out of nowhere! And the town's covered in monsters!

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
Oh... and...

Thiago:
And what? Why did they attack the town?

Thiago:
Where's Amaia? Did the monsters harm you?

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
They... they...

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
They didn't harm anyone... they're just fighting... an Inquisitor.

Thiago:
—

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
No one told the Inquisition! I swear!

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
They showed up not long after we found the carcass in the square. It might've been their work in the first place, now that I think of it.

Jordi:
What's going on, Uncle? Oh, good afternoon there.

Jordi:
You look...

Thiago:
Jordi, come with me.

Jordi:
Uncle?

Thiago:
Quiet.

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
Th-Thiago, it wasn't us... we couldn't have contacted the Inquisition in such a short time, no matter how fast we were.

Thiago:
I know. We need to protect Jordi and explain things.

Thiago:
Maybe someone went to them earlier. A week ago, a month ago, who knows? Rumors of cultists have been spreading for a while now.

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
I-It wasn't me! Or my husband!

Jordi:
Could it be Juan? Maybe the Inquisition found him?

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
You...

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
You knew Juan was a member of the Church of the Deep? When did you find out?

Thiago:
Jordi! Go!

Jordi:
Uh... alright.

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
Thiago!

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
Oh... he's gone.

Alert Townsfolk:
Never mind him. What about the town?

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
I-I don't know. The Inquisitor and the outsiders are fighting the monsters. There's nothing we can do about it.

Alert Townsfolk:
Tsk... the Inquisitor will be coming for us once he's done.

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
Surely not... wait, what are you thinking?

Alert Townsfolk:
The best-case scenario would be both sides taking each other out...

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
What?! You can't possibly be serious!

Alert Townsfolk:
Think about it. Have we really lost that many people to Sea Terrors? Compared to how much damage the Inquisition has done over the years.

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
B-But...

Alert Townsfolk:
When they come for you, can you prove that you're not a cultist?

Indiscreet Townsfolk:
What are we supposed to do then?

Alert Townsfolk:
If the Inquisitor can really kill that many Sea Terrors, the only way to avoid suspicion would be to hand over someone even more suspicious.

Alert Townsfolk:
For example, an Ægir linked to the Church of the Deep.

Sea Terror:
Gkh...

Rear Guard Cultist:
The others have pulled out. But Amaia is nowhere to be seen.

Rear Guard Cultist:
Both an Inquisitor, and the Abyssal Hunters. I've only heard them mentioned in passing by Amaia.

Rear Guard Cultist:
Here on land, though, they're not as troublesome as the Inquisitor.

Rear Guard Cultist:
Find Amaia. Take her, and delay the Abyssal Hunters.

Rear Guard Cultist:
Go. Our siblings have fallen. We are the last ones standing. The Inquisition must not be allowed to take any more of our comrades.

Sea Terror:
(Shifts head in agreement)

Thiago:
Jordi, hurry!

Jordi:
O-Okay...

Jordi:
(What's happened to the town... are those Sea Terrors too?)

Thiago:
It's the Inquisition.

Jordi:
......!

Thiago:
Maybe a High Inquisitor, seeing how he's come to uproot a Church hideout all by himself.

Thiago:
Sea Terrors and cultists have appeared in Gran Faro. There's no explaining this away.

Thiago:
Take this, lad, and the lamp your father left you. Keep them safe.

Jordi:
I—

Thiago:
You're not a child anymore, Jordi Fontanarossa. I've told you everything. This is your last chance to embrace a new life.

Thiago:
I... I always wanted to tell you the truth, convince you to leave, but I...

Jordi:
I know, Uncle. You're like a father to me. Gran Faro is our home. If I leave here... I won't have anything left.

Thiago:
It was going to happen, sooner or later. All the young folks want to leave; you're the exception.

Thiago:
I'll go with you. Sea Terrors are dangerous, but I know how to deal with them. This is our last chance to slip past the Inquisitors, though.

Thiago:
What's that sound?

Jordi:
...The door?

Thiago:
Uhh.... Huh?

Thiago:
You! Not even Sea Terrors eat people, but you people have no such qualms!

Thiago:
Say something! Pyotr! Manuel! I know it's you out there! Cowards!

Jordi:
What's going on?

Thiago:
They've blocked the door.

Jordi:
What? But why?

Thiago:
Because you're an Ægir.

Thiago:
They must've surrounded the place. We'll go up to the attic and leave through the roof.

Specter:
Do I... know you?

Amaia:
Look at you, Laurentina... What happened to your nun's habit? You looked so good in it.

Amaia:
Ah, you found where you belonged, right? The Abyssal Hunters found you, and they want to bring you home?

Specter:
Laurentina... my name is Laurentina.

Amaia:
The name of the vast creation's master.

Specter:
What is this 'vast creation's master?'

Amaia:
The ocean, or its avatar.

Amaia:
Something's not right with your state of mind... You shouldn't be so— Oh, were you awake? When you killed Quintus, for instance?

Specter:
Quin...tus?

Amaia:
You touched the sea, but did not immediately proceed to Ægir? I thought you people longed for home.

Amaia:
Or do you have somebody on land, gently guiding you?

Amaia:
Why did we have to reunite under such circumstances, Laurentina?

Specter:
Your hands, are so cold.

Amaia:
There was a time when there were no secrets between us.

Amaia:
Now, though...

Skadi:
Specter!

Amaia:
When you remember my name, come and find me. If you still remember this conversation, that is.

Amaia:
If your mind is your own then, I will tell you the whole truth.

Amaia:
Farewell, Laurentina.

Specter:
Ah...

Specter:
......

Skadi:
Who was that?

Specter:
I don't know... but she seems to know me?

Skadi:
She has no scent. She's not Seaborn, at least not like Quintus.

Skadi:
We don't have time for her.

Skadi:
Clean up the Sea Terrors, and we'll regroup with the Captain.

Blockading Townsfolk:
Hey, there aren't any Sea Terrors around here, are there?

Helping Townsfolk:
Only dead ones. It's so quiet here... Did the Inquisition take care of them all?

Blockading Townsfolk:
All the better. Come, help me shut them inside. Somebody go fetch the Inquisitor!

Helping Townsfolk:
A-Alright, it's blocked. But why are we doing this to Mayor Thiago when everything's such a mess right now?

Blockading Townsfolk:
Because we're all off to the gallows when things STOP being a mess, unless we do something about it. Go check out the chapel and get someone from the Inquisition.

Helping Townsfolk:
Me? But what if there are still monsters...?

Helping Townsfolk:
Huh? Is there someone on the roof?

Blockading Townsfolk:
Wha—?

Blockading Townsfolk:
It's Jordi and Thiago! Get them! Don't let them get away!

Thiago:
Run!

Jordi:
I, I know!

Thiago:
Get out of town, and don't let the Inquisitors or those bastards catch you!

Jordi:
Alright!

Thiago:
*pant* Keep running north... *pant*... There's a messenger station there that might still be in operation...

Jordi:
Alright!

Thiago:
I put some money in your bag... *pant*... get out of town, get out of the country!

Jordi:
A-Alright!

Thiago:
Jordi!

Jordi:
I'm listening!

Thiago's footsteps slow down.

He looks on as the young Ægir runs desperately down the street.

Thiago:
Run! Don't look back! Keep running!

Thiago:
That's right... get out of here... never look back.

Pursuer's Voice:
Don't let them out of town!

Thiago:
You were right, lad.

Thiago:
This is our home, and no amount of waiting or complaining will change that.

Thiago:
(Ægirian) Farewell, my child!

Pursuing Townsfolk:
Thiago! Where's the Ægir!

Thiago:
Coward!

Pursuing Townsfolk:
W-What the hell are you doing? You'll doom us all! We'll all be branded heretics by the Inquisition, just like the old days!

Thiago:
Are you more afraid of the Inquisition than the Sea Terrors? More afraid of your own people than monsters?

Pursuing Townsfolk:
We already lost everything to the Inquisition once. Do you want that to happen again?

Thiago:
Pah... your fist is like rubber...

Pursuing Townsfolk:
You—wait, what's that... they're still here?!

Sea Terror:
(Ominous slithering sounds)

Pursuing Townsfolk:
I, I've got to get back to the chapel. The Inquisitors will protect me—

Thiago:
Take that, you coward!

Pursuing Townsfolk:
Are, are you mad?! Don't you see the Sea Terrors?

Thiago:
What about the Sea Terrors?!

Thiago:
Did Sea Terrors eat Gran Faro? No, it was you people... you're worse than the Profound Silence.

Thiago:
You've slaughtered compassion with selfishness, whitewashed your own cowardice, and blamed the disaster on the Ægir!

Pursuing Townsfolk:
No, the monsters, they're getting closer—screw it, nutjob, I don't have time for this!

Thiago:
Of course, you coward. When they took Marin, when they took the Ægir, you were right there under the banner of the Penal Battalion!

Thiago:
Murderer!

Pursuing Townsfolk:
—

Pursuing Townsfolk:
Don't think the rest of us are gonna humor you just because you fell in love with an Ægir way back when!

Thiago:
Come at me, coward! You'll get it from me!

Sea Terror:
(Sharp sound of breathing)

Jordi:
*pant*... *pant*...

Jordi:
Thiago...? Uncle Thiago?

Jordi:
*pant*... *pant*...

Jordi:
Uncle—?

Jordi:
*pant* Why...?

Jordi:
I... I have to go back...

???:
(Ægirian) Stop right there, Ægir.

Jordi:
Uh, y-yes!

Ulpianus:
The last Ægir of Gran Faro. The last descendant of Breogan.

Jordi:
Breo... what?

Ulpianus:
The Sea Terrors would kill you, and the Inquisition would imprison you. Come with me. I need you.

Jordi:
A-Are you one of them? The ones commanding the monsters?

Ulpianus:
No! I seek a lost legend, one that caught the attention of even the Academy.

Ulpianus:
Yet his most important legacy is neither a lighthouse nor a ship, but his descendant.

Ulpianus:
You might be the final clue I'm seeking.

Jordi:
I... don't know what you're talking about.

Ulpianus:
That man, Thiago, is not your father. Who were your parents? Your grandparents?

Jordi:
My parents...

Jordi:
They... they went missing... in search of the Eye of Iberia.

Ulpianus:
As cruel as it is, your misfortune is what gives you the chance to become the salvation of Ægir.

Ulpianus:
Come with me. I'd prefer not to use force against kin.

Jordi:
I... This is all coming out of nowhere.

Ulpianus:
Come with me.

Jordi:
I...

Ulpianus:
Hmph.

Jordi:
What?! What's going on?

Elysium:
Quiet, bro. I'm saving your life.

Elysium:
Let's go.

Ulpianus:
A smoke bomb... I shouldn't have let you get away.

Ulpianus:
What's the point of running away with him? You know nothing, Liberi.

???:
You're right, Ægir. There are many mysteries here.

Ulpianus:
......

High Inquisitor:
Transgressor, you will answer my questions, or you will never leave this place.

High Inquisitor:
I hope you're smart enough to recognize this fact.

Elysium:
Good, looks like we've shaken him off. It was the right choice to grab you when the Inquisitor drew near. They aren't fighting right now, are they?

Jordi:
......

Elysium:
Hello?

Jordi:
Oh, er, sorry... I need to go back to town.

Elysium:
Wouldn't recommend it. Most of the Sea Terrors are gone, but something doesn't feel right. And I can't get in touch with Dr. Kal'tsit.

Elysium:
Plus... you were planning to leave, weren't you?

Jordi:
I... no...

Jordi:
I heard that the Inquisitors came to town, and Uncle Thiago was worried I'd be taken away...

Elysium:
The Inquisition, huh...

Elysium:
What did that guy want with you, anyway?

Jordi:
......

Elysium:
Sorry, you don't have to talk if you don't want to.

Elysium:
I'll need a bit of time to decide whether to go back to town and find Dr. Kal'tsit, or get you out of here first.

Jordi:
I'll go with you.

Elysium:
You sure? Your uncle was so desperate to get you out.

Jordi:
If the Inquisition is coming, I doubt I'll be able to escape.

Elysium:
Is that duty worth giving up your life for?

Jordi:
Huh? What do you—?

Elysium:
So you're going back to Gran Faro just out of some vague sense of duty, without even a clear goal?

Elysium:
You've gotta be kidding me. If I were you, I'd leave this place, along with any townsfolk who don't want to get involved. And soon.

Elysium:
This isn't like running into a swarm of Originium Slugs while camping out in the woods. I hate to say it, but ordinary people can't do a thing here.

Jordi:
I just feel like there has to be something left for me to do.

Jordi:
I grew up here, listening to those legends, gazing at the coastline, reading my parents' notes... I don't want my farewell to be like this.

Jordi:
This place is my home.
