Amaia:
We're almost at our destination.

Ulpianus:
......

Amaia:
What? You'd never would've reached the Stultifera in one piece without me. The children of the sea would've ripped you apart, crushed you, or bound your limbs as they dragged you off to their nests.

Ulpianus:
You're not like Quintus.

Amaia:
What might could you be talking about? My skin? This sack of flesh?

Amaia:
None of that matters.

Ulpianus:
What are you trying to accomplish?

Amaia:
And what are YOU trying to accomplish, Hunter? Your kind already loathe your enemies while simultaneously doubting the purity of your own blood. But still... you pretend to be calm.

Amaia:
What are you trying to get out of me?

Ulpianus:
......

Amaia:
Silence. A wise choice. Ægir are not a sociable lot, it is known. But it seems there are exceptions.

Amaia:
Or, are you just a bit of an unpopular grump?

Ulpianus:
......

Amaia:
I can answer your question. Quintus wouldn't, nor will other humans. But the Seaborn will. Like Heralds, we come to understand things. We are not limited by the way humans think.

Ulpianus:
I don't need your riddles.

Amaia:
Hmm...

Amaia:
Before coming here, I was in the midst of translating a literary classic from Ursus. It was about race and nations. About history. I was putting it into Iberian and Victorian.

Amaia:
Take a look, Mister Hunter.

Ulpianus's gaze follows the woman's hand, his eyes subconsciously drawn towards the ocean.

A pitch-black sea. Dense with dark clouds. Oppressive. And yet, a vague outline of the starry sky is visible.

Amaia:
Even the Ægir rarely look out across the ocean from the water's surface. Different races, different countries. The land is fractured in every sense, and its conflicts are neverending.

Amaia:
But when you look over the boundless sea, do you see anything representing those divides?

Inquisitor Irene:
Tch... These damn monsters!

Inquisitor Irene:
Jordi! Are you alright?!

Sea Terror:
(Slithering sounds, rubbing against the wall)

Jordi:
G-Get away from me—!

High Inquisitor Dario:
Seems like activating this facility has made these poor creatures realize that this place doesn't make a very good nest.

Jordi:
High Inquisitor!

High Inquisitor Dario:
Keep ascending, Ægir. Your hands are for wielding tools, not fire and steel.

High Inquisitor Dario:
The plan is unchanged. Go with Irene and find what the Inquisition and the Hunters are seeking.

Jordi:
I, I know! Please be careful!

Skadi:
Do you really think we can find that ship?

Gladiia:
It can only pass through Iberia.

Skadi:
I don't understand... If it is a place like Rhodes Island, why hasn't it tried to return in sixty years?

Specter:
We too are lost, unable to find a way back home. Is that not so?

Sea Terror:
(Sounds of stirring, slapping the water)

Specter:
The children are increasing in number.

Skadi:
...Are you alright?

Specter:
Me? Why do you ask?

Skadi:
You didn't speak a single word on the way to Iberia.

Specter:
Have you always seen me as a chatterbox, Skadi?

Skadi:
......

Skadi stares deeply into Specter's eyes.

When she'd finally found Laurentina on land, her eyes were clouded over.

Then she saw it in Sal Viento. A fragment of Laurentina as she was. But it was short-lived. After returning to Rhodes Island, she seemed to have fallen back into the abyss.

But now, Skadi begins to find herself unable to distinguish which corner of Specter's mind she is currently dealing with.

She has an ominous guess.

One that has always swirled through her mind.

Specter:
What's the matter?

Skadi:
......

Gladiia:
No need to overthink this, Skadi.

Gladiia:
And the same goes for you, my sleepy little mermaid. We don't have much time. You will awaken.

Specter:
Will I?

Gladiia:
You will.

Gladiia:
For the time being... Go with Shark and take out the small fry. Their numbers are endless, so remember to adjust your breathing and conserve energy.

Skadi:
You should already know that I prefer it that way.

Specter:
...Must we be in such a hurry to perform again? The storm is not yet ready.

Specter:
Heh, but it seems our dance partner won't be kept waiting.

Inquisitor Irene:
Tch, there's no end to them.

Jordi:
Doña Irene!

Inquisitor Irene:
You're still alive! So that flash of light was from the High Inquisitor's lantern after all!

Jordi:
Um, he wanted us to continue on... But what exactly should we do? Keep searching for the ship's location?

Inquisitor Irene:
I was originally planning to wait for the technicians to arrive, but seeing how you got this big fella started all by yourself—

Sea Terror:
Hiss... Hiss...

Inquisitor Irene:
—Make every second count!

Bizarre Cultist:
Thiago? So you're finally seeing clearly.

Thiago:
Why haven't you fled? The Penal Battalion and that Inquisitor have been lying in ambush in town.

Bizarre Cultist:
Then why haven't your proud townspeople returned?

Thiago:
......!

Bizarre Cultist:
The Inquisitors have already taken away all the confused, directionless residents of Gran Faro, and you already know what's going to happen to them.

Bizarre Cultist:
You know all too well.

Thiago:
But I can't sit by and watch Gran Faro go up in smoke. I have to do whatever I can.

Bizarre Cultist:
You? Fight the Inquisition? Fair enough, Thiago. But that will only hasten the town's demise. Iberia will never tolerate an act of treason.

Bizarre Cultist:
While we welcome all into our fold, but the weak do not have that right. This 'determination' of yours is but a sick joke your mind is playing on you. You understand nothing. Who do you think you're talking to?

Thiago:
Who? If I'd cared enough to investigate, you would've been flushed out by the Penal Battalion long ago.

Thiago:
Tell me then, what can people like you offer Gran Faro?

Bizarre Cultist:
In the end, this town is... a mere human settlement.

Bizarre Cultist:
What we seek to offer up to this land is of a much higher calling than your meaningless baubles.

Sea Terror:
(A slithering sound emerges from cracks in the building)

Bizarre Cultist:
You've been followed.

Sea Terror:
Hiss...

Elysium:
Hah, these Sea Terrors have pretty sharp senses.

Bizarre Cultist:
An outsider? We will allow it. Your flesh and blood shall become nourishment for our wounded. We all give back to this land.

Inquisitor Irene:
Tch, the nethersea brand has already reached this far. The walls, the stairs, it's all over the place!

Inquisitor Irene:
Are you still not done yet? They're getting closer!

Jordi:
Almost there!

Jordi:
How does this make any sense? Even after all these years, the signal-receiving devices are still operable... But why? How?

Jordi:
Oh, the logs—

Jordi:
—Woah, there it is! Now let's take a look—

Sea Terror:
Hiss...

Inquisitor Irene:
Ugh—

Inquisitor Irene:
(Their numbers are exploding! They're moving through the nethersea brand, as if they've merged with the ground entirely!)

Inquisitor Irene:
(At this rate, even Maestro and the Hunters won't be able to stay in this branded place for much longer...)

Sea Terror:
(Rough sounds of slithering across the floor)

Inquisitor Irene:
Damn it— Underneath us! Jordi!

Jordi:
Wh-What?!

Gladiia:
Continue.

Jordi:
Ah, um... Okay...

Inquisitor Irene:
Abyssal Hunters!

Gladiia:
You're too weak. Swarms like this require swifter movements. Spare yourself the energy to breathe.

Gladiia:
Like so.

Inquisitor Irene:
Urgh...!

Gladiia:
How much longer, Ægir?

Jordi:
Th-There are no records in the logs of how to operate these information terminals, so I'll have to keep searching—

Jordi:
—There's some data here... I don't understand what it means, but it keeps popping up!

Inquisitor Irene:
Keeps popping up? Even if that's from the Inquisition's last attempt, that should've been years ago!

Jordi:
I, I'm not sure. I assumed the data loss was caused by a power outage, b-but—

Jordi:
If my hypothesis is right...

Jordi:
There's a ship that's been sending signals to this lighthouse for decades!

Inquisitor Irene:
What...

Gladiia:
How far away it is?

Jordi:
I know, I'm looking... Ugh, where are the navigation records—

Jordi:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
What is it?

Jordi:
...It's very close.

Jordi:
How can it be... so close?

Jordi:
Waaaah!

Inquisitor Irene:
Wh-What happened?!

Gladiia:
I'm afraid the underground portion of the tower has been swallowed up by the nethersea brand.

Inquisitor Irene:
We need to make our decision, now!

Gladiia:
Decision? What decision? If we have the means to locate the ship, then we will go.

Inquisitor Irene:
No! We should eradicate the Sea Terrors to ensure that the Penal Battalion's reinforcements can arrive safely!

Gladiia:
Impossible. You will merely wear yourselves out before the stronger prey can even join the hunt.

Gladiia:
Or do you mean to say that Iberia has hundreds upon thousands of people willing to hold the line to their dying breath, like the High Inquisitor below us?

Inquisitor Irene:
No, but—

Gladiia:
Opportunity waits for no one.

Inquisitor Irene:
......

Gladiia:
Have you confirmed the coordinates?

Jordi:
Ah, um, I can determine an approximate range, but I don't know why it's spinning around, or if that means—

Gladiia:
It is being kept afloat by aberrant ocean currents. See that square surrounded by Seaborn? That's what the ship looks like now.

Inquisitor Irene:
But, that ship is the only vessel we have.

Gladiia:
You can have it. We don't need it.

High Inquisitor Dario:
No.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Go with them.

Inquisitor Irene:
High Inquisitor?! What did you just say?

High Inquisitor Dario:
The Eye of Iberia has already been activated. There should still be some working safeguards in place.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Lord Carmen will arrive to purge the evil remaining along these shores. We don't have time to waste on these endless hordes.

Inquisitor Irene:
Th-Then, I'll stay with you, sir!

High Inquisitor Dario:
No. You ought to accompany them.

High Inquisitor Dario:
You should go see the ocean.

Inquisitor Irene:
I...

High Inquisitor Dario:
What saved your life, what let the rescuers find you... wasn't me. It was the Scriptures you hold in your hand.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Make the right choice. Do not bring shame to Iberia.

Inquisitor Irene:
Understood, High Inquisitor.

Inquisitor Irene:
I will become Iberia's eyes, and return the Stultifera to our country's embrace.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Then go.

High Inquisitor Dario:
I look forward to seeing the moment you pass down the correct verdict.

Inquisitor Irene:
Yes, High Inquisitor!

High Inquisitor Dario:
You should leave too. Go with them.

Jordi:
Sir... I don't want to. I want to stay here.

High Inquisitor Dario:
It's too dangerous.

Jordi:
I don't know a single thing about that golden vessel. The best I could do is bask in its magnificence, but... I don't think that's where my duty lies.

Jordi:
I, um, this might be a strange thing to say, but I... I only felt my own worth when I was exploring this lighthouse, so—

Jordi:
Please, let me stay here.

Skadi:
Exactly one hundred down. But nothing has changed.

Specter:
They're like stars in the sky.

Skadi:
Breaking the encirclement would be simple, but defending the lighthouse? How long would we be slashing away?

Specter:
What a fine, colorful carpet they make as their carcasses dissolve.

Specter:
A carpet of life... Ah, this must be the most beautiful carpet in the land.

Skadi:
(True, the nethersea brand is spreading, which means...)

High Inquisitor Dario:
Your weapons cannot burn them, but mine can.

Gladiia:
That's only a temporary solution. Cauterizing the tips of the seagrass won't stop it from growing.

High Inquisitor Dario:
It's good enough. Grab your people and get out of here. Steer the ship out, or you won't be able to get your bearings.

Gladiia:
You realize what that means.

High Inquisitor Dario:
You don't need to tell me, Ægir.

Gladiia:
Very well. Do your best to survive, High Inquisitor.

Gladiia:
Shark, Skadi!

Skadi:
That's the ship...

Gladiia:
Yes.

Gladiia:
After so long spent waiting on land, we are finally about to return to Ægir. We...

Gladiia's words slow to a halt.

Her hand caresses her neck. On her well-concealed skin is a patch that is rough to the touch.

The ship is right in front of her eyes. —No, don't be hasty, Gladiia. The ocean is still dangerous. Otherwise, it would not have trapped the three Hunters ashore.

But without a doubt, her heart is smoldering.

High Inquisitor Dario:
......

Jordi:
They've left.

High Inquisitor Dario:
That's right. Which means we're stranded here until the Penal Battalion's reinforcements arrive.

Jordi:
......

High Inquisitor Dario:
You've done well, Ægir, so you've earned the right to answer a question.

Jordi:
Ah, o-okay! I swear to answer truthfully!

High Inquisitor Dario:
Did you make your own decision to leave the shore, and come here with us?

High Inquisitor Dario:
You're just an ordinary person. Janitor or whatever, you are no warrior. Few can wander out to sea, let alone witness a battle against the Sea Terrors.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Yet... Look, your expression doesn't shake at all under the light of my lantern. What are you thinking? What do you want?

Jordi:
......

Jordi:
I can't even remember ever seeing my mother or father. Everyone always told me I'm an Ægir, and that we came here to repair the lighthouse. But it's all ruined.

Jordi:
I... Before all this, I didn't know a single thing. I was lost and confused. To be honest, when the Sea Terrors came, Thi— Someone told me to leave as soon as possible. But...

Jordi:
Truthfully, I didn't even know where I could go.

Jordi:
Because I'm an Ægir, all I can do is keep my head down as I trudge through life. And, um... just so you know, I'm actually a chapel nurse, not a janitor.

Jordi:
But that doesn't really count as work, does it? All the things Mr. Elysium talks about, the way he acts... Maybe that's what it really means to live life upon this land.

Jordi:
That's why... I felt like this was an opportunity.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Are you not afraid of death?

Jordi:
I don't think there's anyone who isn't, sir.

High Inquisitor Dario:
I should be frank with you. The nethersea brand has already completely engulfed the coastline. We don't have much time left.

Jordi:
Oh.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Lord Carmen and Dr. Kal'tsit may have their methods, but I'm not so optimistic.

High Inquisitor Dario:
When the others left, we were basically condemned to death.

Jordi:
Is... that why you insisted on me going with them?

High Inquisitor Dario:
It's too late to regret it now. You chose to defy me, of your own free will. But even if you die here, your death would be by no means meaningless.

Jordi:
......

High Inquisitor Dario:
You're not shaken.

Jordi:
Haha... Just a little bit, maybe. But even if I went with them, wouldn't I still have nine-to-one odds of dying?

Jordi:
As long as I stay here in this lighthouse, I can at least feel like I've already—

High Inquisitor Dario:
Don't be in such a hurry to give up.

High Inquisitor Dario:
The Eye of Iberia should have its own defenses. Go start them up.

Jordi:
Ah, alright. But, where will you go?

High Inquisitor Dario:
Now...

High Inquisitor Dario:
We are alone at sea, far from our homeland.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Again and again we arrive on this little reef, the weight of our lives and of our vessels so much heavier than the place itself.

Sea Terror:
...Hiss...

Sea Terror:
(Swarms of slithering sounds)

High Inquisitor Dario:
Between the ocean and Iberia, there is no such thing as justice... or evil.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Only sword and lantern—

High Inquisitor Dario:
Only me.
