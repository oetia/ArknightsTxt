High Inquisitor:
Irene.

Inquisitor Irene:
Yes, maestro... I mean, sir!

High Inquisitor:
You seem distracted.

Inquisitor Irene:
I... I'm fine.

High Inquisitor:
Gran Faro is a tiny town, so small that most maps don't even bother to list it.

High Inquisitor:
But this is a request from Lord Carmen himself, and it involves Dr. Kal'tsit and those Ægir.

Inquisitor Irene:
I know, sir. I—

High Inquisitor:
If you still haven't found your answer, I will not give you permission to join the mission.

Inquisitor Irene:
I'd already made up my mind when I first decided to follow in your footsteps and become an Inquisitor.

High Inquisitor:
Yes, before you even knew the question. An answer is worthless if it cannot explain what you see and hear.

High Inquisitor:
Don't die a worthless death, Irene. You know what we're fighting against. And you must find your own answer.

Inquisitor Irene:
I—

Inquisitor Irene:
...Yes, sir.

Gladiia:
Lady Kal'tsit.

Gladiia's tone does not change, but her footsteps reflect her mood.

A blink of the eye, and she is by Kal'tsit's side.

Kal'tsit:
Good work, Gladiia.

Gladiia:
The Inquisition didn't do anything to you, did they?

Kal'tsit:
The fact that Iberia has not yet sunk into the sea is proof that they still retain a shred of humility and vigilance.

Gladiia:
You found a way, as promised.

Kal'tsit:
Yes. However...

Kal'tsit:
Even if Iberia is willing to let go of their fears, what about Ægir?

Kal'tsit:
What about you?

Gladiia:
If this temporary cooperation is necessary to help us return to the ocean... so be it.

Alty:
Finally, an Ægir with some sense, right? Like the waves themselves, like the rays and texture of the sea.

Alty:
Hello there, special Ægir. I believe you've already met our other members?

Gladiia:
Yes. You're also a member of AUS?

Alty:
Alty, bassist. Nice to meet you.

Alty:
How are things outside?

Gladiia:
The cultists are out in force, but individually they're rather weak.

Gladiia:
My Hunters can take care of everything.

Kal'tsit:
The Inquisition will only work with us once we've taken care of the problems in Gran Faro.

Gladiia:
Then there's no time to waste.

Gladiia raises her lance.

At the same time, she senses that something is not right.

Gladiia:
......!

Gladiia:
There, among the Sea Terrors... but how could it be...?

Kal'tsit:
Kal'tsit here.

Elysium:
Dr. Kal'tsit! Their goal is—

Kal'tsit:
...Elysium?

Gladiia:
What's the matter?

Kal'tsit:
One of our operators is in trouble.

Gladiia:
Something lurks here.

Kal'tsit:
As we discussed, Alty, the members of AUS can stay ashore.

Kal'tsit:
We'll handle this as quickly as possible.

Alty:
Sure, we can wait.

Alty:
And we'll be happy to provide some BGM for your campaign.

Skadi:
...Too weak.

Skadi:
They keep coming. Buying time?

Skadi:
Or spreading... something.

Skadi:
I must find the leader.

Sea Terror:
—Gkh—!

Specter:
......

Skadi:
Specter.

Specter:
...Hm?

Specter:
Ah... Skadi. Long time no see.

Specter:
Something the matter?

Skadi:
...Are you alright?

Specter:
I'm fine, just a little tired.

Specter:
Yes... We're fighting, right? The scent of the ocean... reminds me of home.

Specter:
But, home? My home... huh...

Sea Terror:
Gkh—!

Specter:
The sea.

Specter:
The scent of the sea grows stronger. Are we home, Skadi? Is this the way home?

Skadi:
...It will be, Specter. Laurentina. I promise.

Specter:
Tell me then... what's that before my eyes?

Skadi:
What?

A figure strides down the street, humming a tune.

The streets are a mess in the aftermath of the panicking townsfolk, but it hardly bothers Frost as she plucks at the air and imagines music.

Skadi:
Hmph!

Sea Terror:
(Slithering sounds)

Skadi:
The Sea Terrors keep away from her. No, they ignore her. Is she... playing an instrument?

Specter:
Does it sound nice?

Skadi:
I don't know.

Specter:
Then ask.

Skadi:
Wait!

Elysium:
*pant*... *pant*...

Elysium:
(Did I shake him?)

Elysium:
Dammit?!

Elysium:
Was it when we first met? No, he didn't even touch me.

Ulpianus:
Those documents must be destroyed, Iberian.

Ulpianus:
Obey, and you may keep your limbs. Attached, if you prefer.

Elysium:
(Shit, he's fast...)

Elysium:
Weren't your friends only burning them because there wasn't time to save them all?

Elysium:
With your skills, you could just as easily have taken them yourself. So why the need to burn them?

Ulpianus:
'Friends?'

The man growls from the bottom of his throat, a sound born of humiliation.

Ulpianus:
We are not 'friends.'

Elysium:
Then what?

Ulpianus:
It doesn't concern you. Surrender the documents, and leave this place.

Ulpianus:
Whether you're with the Inquisition, or with another country...

Ulpianus:
......!

Elysium:
(He stopped.)

Ulpianus:
Yes... you've always been sharp.

The mysterious Ægir gazes into the distance.

'Friends.'

Ulpianus:
(Ægirian) We may be bound by blood, but you must stay away from Ægir for now.

Elysium:
—!

Elysium evades the attack, but it's immediately clear why he managed to.

The sword's aura rips the charred papers to shreds, sending the splintered truth drifting into the wind.

Elysium:
Crap—

Ulpianus:
(Ægirian) They cannot return to Ægir just yet. Allowing everyone to act on their own will only accelerate the destruction.

Ulpianus:
(Ægirian) Even though Ægir has already chosen the path of self-annihilation.

Saint Carmen:
No more Sea Terrors approach.

Saint Carmen:
Unsurprising numbers, for the coast. Now, where are you hiding?

Wounded Cultist:
You... *cough* No! Not the lantern!

Saint Carmen:
Answer me. What do you intend for Gran Faro?

Wounded Cultist:
That lantern! Get it off me—

Saint Carmen:
Answer me.

Wounded Cultist:
Ugh...

Wounded Cultist:
It... It's...

Saint Carmen:
What are you pointing at?

Carmen looks back in the direction that the cultist is indicating.

A statue stands in the middle of the square.

Saint Carmen:
Ah.

Saint Carmen:
Gran Faro. The Great Lighthouse. Of course. You're seeking the lighthouse of Gran Faro.

Wounded Cultist:
Stop... stop it... ugh...

Saint Carmen:
The nobles once called those great monuments the Eye of Iberia. Dozens of them once stood on Iberia's coastline.

Saint Carmen:
Even had the Witch King's Tower in Leithanien not been toppled, it would still have been dwarfed by these guardians of the sea.

Saint Carmen:
They are the single greatest mark that human civilization has ever left on this land.

Wounded Cultist:
The sea... *cough* the Eye of Iberia...

Wounded Cultist:
The miracle... destroyed the sacrilege... argh... take that lantern away!

Saint Carmen:
The Profound Silence destroyed most of the lighthouses, and disabled the rest.

Saint Carmen:
What are you plotting?

Wounded Cultist:
......

Saint Carmen:
I see. So you knew...

Saint Carmen:
You knew that one remained operational. That the goal of the Gran Faro project was to protect what was left of the Eye of Iberia.

Saint Carmen:
That's why you've been lurking here, awaiting your chance.

Wounded Cultist:
You...

Saint Carmen:
I never expected there to be traitors in the very heart of the Inquisition. Where are they?

Wounded Cultist:
Ha... hehehe...

Wounded Cultist:
While you're here... babbling away...

Wounded Cultist:
Look under your feet... and come face to face... with your pathetic... narrow-mindedness...

Saint Carmen:
What?

Dying Sea Terror:
......

Dying Sea Terror:
(Unsettling slithering sounds)

Saint Carmen:
Hm.

Saint Carmen:
The Sea Terrors are... glowing?

Saint Carmen:
What is this luminescence?

Kal'tsit:
Get away from it!

Saint Carmen:
Ah—

Kal'tsit:
Mon3tr!

Mon3tr:
(Impatient growling)

Kal'tsit:
Meltdown.

Mon3tr:
(Agitated roars)

Specter:
Hello.

Frost:
(Peaceful riff)

Specter:
There is a familiar scent on you... Do you know what it is?

Frost:
(Spirited riff)

Specter:
A pleasant melody, but not the one that I know.

Frost:
Then, how does the one you know go?

Specter:
......

When she prayed, the stars ceased to shimmer♪

When she wept, the night let out a smile♪

When she laments, the anguish sprawled upon her madness♪

Frost:
...A song of Ægir. A sad song.

Frost:
But I don't like it. It belongs in the past. It lacks passion, and wallows in futile sentimentality—the same as Ægir itself.

Specter:
A shame.

Frost:
You've come home, Ægir.

Specter:
Home? Me?

Frost:
Sing.

Frost:
In song, you will rediscover yourself.

Specter:
Song?

Specter:
What memories will singing recall?

Frost:
Just sing. You will encounter your past. You must eventually find and face your destiny, or it will find you.

Frost:
That's how it has ever been, since I left the ocean.

Specter:
What a strange woman. But I don't mind singing.

Specter:
Then sing.

Specter:
La la la, la la la♪

Specter:
When she prays, the stars ceased to shimmer♪

......

...

Amaia:
As always, there's such sorrow in your song.

Specter:
Who are... you?

Amaia:
I never imagined we'd meet again in such circumstances, Laurentina.
