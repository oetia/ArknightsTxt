Inquisitor Irene:
Tch... the further in we go, the more Sea Terrors there are.

Inquisitor Irene:
It's getting dangerous...

Inquisitor Irene:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
Maestro... how do I become like them...?

???:
Gkh...

Inquisitor Irene:
Seaborn?!

Inquisitor Irene:
(It's the same one we saw on the deck. The Hunter's attacks didn't do any damage?!)

???:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
(How will it come at me? With its limbs? Its fangs?)

Inquisitor Irene:
(My handcannon... I need to create distance—)

???:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
Wait.

Inquisitor Irene:
Wait a second! What's that on your belt?!

Inquisitor Irene:
Why would you... could you be...?!

???:
Graaaahhhh!!

Inquisitor Irene:
Argh! *Cough*

Inquisitor Irene:
(What strength! I barely managed to block it!)

???:
...I...

???:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
Do you have something to say, monster?

Inquisitor Irene:
I can't go down here... I won't!

Inquisitor Irene:
I'm an Inquisitor of Iberia!

High Inquisitor Dario:
*Cough*...

High Inquisitor Dario:
It has taken too long to burn away the nethersea brand.

High Inquisitor Dario:
The situation's not looking good.

Sea Terror:
(Numerous slithering sounds)

Jordi:
(I can see what's going on down there from here.)

Jordi:
How many hours have passed? How much longer can he hang on?

Jordi:
I... if I... no, don't think about it, Jordi. Focus!

Jordi:
The Inquisition... Hurry...

Specter:
Is that all?

Seaborn:
Grr...

Specter:
Listen to your friends wail. The flower of Sal Viento at least had its beauty, but what about you?

Specter:
As my first dance lesson after waking up, I must say you're underwhelming.

Seaborn:
Gkh!

Skadi:
It's getting away!

Specter:
I'll go after it. You go find the little Iberian bird.

Skadi:
How are you feeling?

Specter:
Better than ever. My memories are tumbling down like a waterfall from the heavens. It'll take a while for the full picture to emerge, though.

Specter:
And some of my more recent memories are rather embarrassing.

Skadi:
I'll go. Your mind is still unstable.

Specter:
Oh? Trying to steal my prey?

Skadi:
It'll try to escape to the sea.

Specter:
Of course it will. But it wasn't running just because it couldn't win.

Specter:
What did it find?

Skadi:
We don't have time—

???:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
*cough* I'll never get used to handcannons.

Inquisitor Irene:
Hey, where are you—

Inquisitor Irene:
Huh? The Abyssal Hunters?

Specter:
Hello, Irene. I see you've brought us more prey.

Inquisitor Irene:
Did you just call me Irene? Have you... have you regained your memories?

Specter:
Not entirely, but I know I'm in a great mood right now.

Skadi:
This is not the time.

Skadi:
That's the one from the deck. It's fast enough to dodge the captain's lunge.

Specter:
I really must tip my hat to you, Irene. For chasing it all the way here without taking a scratch.

Inquisitor Irene:
I can't take credit for it. It hardly even attacked. Look, it's still not, even now.

Specter:
I see... I thought it wouldn't be able to resist if we chatted like this and showed it an opening.

???:
......

Specter:
Your friend just left, you know. It's not too late to go after them.

Specter:
Or are you a pacifist too?

Gladiia:
......

Gladiia:
(Kazimierz, a landlocked country where Skadi stayed for a time. A place of sprawling grasslands and forests, the Land of Knights.)

Gladiia:
(Knights...)

Gladiia:
Is it a coincidence? Or did something draw him there?

Gladiia:
This ship, Breogan. What did you intend to leave behind for your homeland? Where have you hidden the answer?

Gladiia:
...Hmm.

Gladiia:
(Sea Terror carcasses? And not only that...)

Gladiia:
(The wounds are clean and precise. They show no signs of resistance. Scents mingle in the air. The air here is stale.)

Gladiia:
(What else is there on this ship?)

???:
——

Inquisitor Irene:
Your belt and pocket watch are undoubtedly human in origin, and even in the Iberian style!

Inquisitor Irene:
What are you?

???:
......

Specter:
It's stalling for time.

Skadi:
This will get complicated if the other one gets back to the ocean.

???:
......

Specter:
Still not attacking? What a passive dance partner.

Specter:
I'll take the lead, Skadi.

Skadi:
Right.

???:
—Guh!

???:
Guh... grrrr... gah...

Specter:
Come on, fight back already. I'm starting to feel like the bad guy.

Skadi:
...No!

Skadi:
It's not stalling for time!

Inquisitor Irene:
The sound of bells?! What?

???:
(Sharp screech)

Bells echo through the empty hall.

The lights in the hall flash. The Seaborn lands in the direction of the throne while the three are distracted.

Yes, the throne.

There is a throne on this Iberian ship. A symbol of pride, power, arrogance, and deceit.

Specter:
It's like...

Specter trails off, knowing what she was about to say was far too absurd.

It wears a crown, and drapes itself in the same colors as the curtains. It kneels by the side of the throne, the two inextricably bonded with one another.

It resembles the queens and ministers of old, serving the golden sun of Iberia.

A silhouette emerges from behind the throne.

Irene raises her lantern over her head, trying to illuminate the shadowy figure.

Seaborn?:
Why do you set foot on my ship?

Seaborn?:
*cough* *cough* Pah.

Seaborn?:
Who would ignore a question from the great Alfonso? Why are you here?

Captain Alfonso:
Why have you broken the silence, and come for MY Iberia, which had lain forgotten for decades?

Captain Alfonso:
I will start with you. Answer me, child of Old Iberia.

Inquisitor Irene:
—

Irene could not believe her eyes.

She'd seen the Seaborn's face before. She had devoted much time of her time during her Inquisitor training to the study of history, immersing herself in doctrines and creeds.

How dare this Seaborn claim to be Alfonso?

How dare it claim to be Iberia's greatest ship captain?

Inquisitor Irene:
—You, you can't possibly be the captain of this ship, monster!

Inquisitor Irene:
Alfonso was almost fifty years-old sixty years ago, but you look even younger than the great hero was back then!

Irene knows she is shaken, but she cannot show weakness.

She reflexively raises her lantern, as her commanding officer would have.

Inquisitor Irene:
Drop the mask, Seaborn!

Captain Alfonso:
......

???:
......

The light of her lantern flickers. The tiny speck in the Inquisitor's hand seems to fit the word 'lost' better than the lights of this golden hall.

The Golden Age.

The 'Seaborn' briefly lays its eyes on Irene before turning away dismissively, rubbing 'Alfonso's' inhuman arm.

A short silence surrounds the hero.

Captain Alfonso:
'Seaborn'? I don't like that name.

Captain Alfonso:
Tell me your name, child of Old Iberia.

Inquisitor Irene:
I am Irene, Inquisitor of Iberia.

Inquisitor Irene:
And 'Old Iberia'? You dare defile the name of—

Captain Alfonso:
And you dare talk to me like that?!

???:
(A screech interrupts the exchange)

Inquisitor Irene:
Agh!

Captain Alfonso:
Where were you when we burned Victoria's ships and sunk the Lion King's honor to the bottom of the lake?

Captain Alfonso:
Where were you when I paved the streets of Sal Viento with pure gold, brought back in my ships?

Captain Alfonso:
Where were you when the Tercios darkened Leithanien's dawn like a black cloud?

Inquisitor Irene:
You—

Captain Alfonso:
(Violent coughing) *cough* *cough* Pah.

Captain Alfonso:
I am Alfonso, Duke of Old Iberia, Admiral of the Armada, Captain of the Stultifera, and King of my own kingdom. You, a mere Inquisitor, dare question me?

???:
...(Shakes head impatiently)

Captain Alfonso:
So the church's fools have crossed the ocean to find me. What did you expect, a pat on the back?

Captain Alfonso:
Go back. No matter how you got here, the Stultifera Navis does not welcome you. Garcia, my chief mate... no need be so bothered by them.

Captain Alfonso:
They will repay the sea a thousand fold for the blood they made you spill.

Chief Mate:
Ah... (Nods)

Inquisitor Irene:
Mocking the Inquisition is a serious crime in Iberia.

Captain Alfonso:
Did you not understand what I just said? Leave. There is not a single living soul on this ship, child of Old Iberia.

Inquisitor Irene:
We've sacrificed so much to—!

Captain Alfonso:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
—I'm not here to ask for your permission!

Captain Alfonso:
Such impertinence. This is why I never liked the church.

Captain Alfonso:
A crime? Against a church too helpless to stand against even the feeble royal house?

Captain Alfonso:
......

Captain Alfonso:
If you're really from Old Iberia, then tell me. Who is the incumbent pope? Carmen?

Inquisitor Irene:
...You know Saint Carmen's name?

Captain Alfonso:
Saint? A saint? Ha...

Captain Alfonso:
Haha... A saint... Hahaha.

Inquisitor Irene:
What are you laughing at?!

Captain Alfonso:
He didn't even have the mettle to become pope? Does he not feel ashamed when he sees himself in the mirror?

Captain Alfonso:
No wonder it took you sixty years to find this place. It seems disaster has made Iberia weak.

Captain Alfonso:
But no matter. Before the ship's doctor joined the corals, we discussed what might have become of Iberia. This is not unexpected.

Captain Alfonso:
The floor that you stand on, this immaculate golden hall—THIS is the motherland I know.

Captain Alfonso:
THIS is Iberia, not the backwater you speak of, half of which you refuse to see or understand.

Captain Alfonso:
How far has the once-great empire fallen? Is it really so pathetic that it took you sixty years to find me?

Alfonso descends from the podium.

Irene takes a step back. Her lantern flickers.

Captain Alfonso:
Now then, why are there two Ægir with you? There is no place for the Ægir in my Iberia.

Specter:
We meant no offense, Captain. We were merely chasing some ugly monsters, and mistook your chief mate for one of them.

Skadi:
...How did you survive so long here?

Captain Alfonso:
That's the question, ain't it, you Ægir fools? It's been so, so many years since I took up hunting, as a hobby. Either today or tomorrow should've been the day of reckoning.

Captain Alfonso:
But you chased away my quarry. Now we must once again rely on those—

Captain Alfonso:
—No. Wait... no!

Skadi:
...?

Captain Alfonso:
You... you are not Ægir! You're more than Ægir! Both of you!

Captain Alfonso:
What's your name?

Skadi:
...Skadi.

Captain Alfonso:
No, no. No no no, Ægir. Don't try to deceive me. We may have been trapped on this ship for decades, but we are no fools.

Captain Alfonso:
They call you Ishar-mla.

Amaia:
Did you hear the bells, Ulpianus?

Ulpianus:
It's a miracle that anything works on this ship at all.

Amaia:
Here, the bells signal the start of the hunt.

Ulpianus:
But who's the hunter, and who's the prey?

Amaia:
The children of the ocean don't care. If they consider Alfonso to be their kin—albeit weakened—they're willing to offer their own flesh and blood, all to ensure the survival of the strong.

Ulpianus:
......

Amaia:
A Hunter approaches.

Ulpianus:
Gladiia. She's too sharp. The skills I learned on land will only work for so long. She'll detect me soon.

Amaia:
What will you do?

Ulpianus:
What will YOU do?

Amaia:
Answering a question with a question? I... I'm interested in your choice, Ulpianus.

Amaia:
I never expected to become interested in the Abyssal Hunters again, but Laurentina fascinates me. I see so much possibility in her.

Amaia:
And you, you've made your choice of your own accord, while retaining your sanity. Have you noticed? More and more, you're becoming like one of us.

Ulpianus:
......

Amaia:
Can you reach the truth? Cast aside revelation, lay open the body of god, and learn the truth of the gods of the sea?

Amaia:
The answer you're seeking is tantalizing. Heh, look at me, showing curiosity. Perhaps there's something human in me yet.

Ulpianus:
The revelation is imprinted upon the instincts of god's children. Our ways of thinking couldn't be more different.

Amaia:
Oh my.

Amaia:
You sound even more like a Seaborn than I do.
