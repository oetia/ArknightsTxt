Carol:
Grani, are you leaving? What about Miss Skadi?

Grani:
Yeah, it's about time I head back to Rhodes Island for my next assignment. I'll find time to come see you. As for Skadi, she's a bit of a loner, so she left by herself.

Grani:
With Skadi's infamy well known around here, the bounty hunters should steer clear of this place from now on.

Carol:
Hehe, that's true. It might take a while for us to rebuild, but... this is the beginning of our new lives.

Carol:
Well, take care. Come visit us during the next harvest season. We'll treat you to something special.

Grani:
Hehe, sounds good to me!

Carol:
Oh right, a messenger just brought this letter.  It's addressed to Dewville, but it says here that it's for you.

Grani:
Oh, it's an envelope from Rhodes Island. They must have found me through the liaison office's directory. This place is off the grid, so that probably made it harder for everyone.

Grani:
Let's see here...

(To Grani: Skadi has set off for Dewville without our permission. She's not there on a mission. Be careful.)

(Good luck, Nearl)

Grani:
Come on, tell me something I don't know...

Carol:
Hey, what are you doing, Grani?

Grani:
Making a paper airplane.

Grani:
Rhodes Island stationery is some high quality stuff. Planes like these fly a long way.
