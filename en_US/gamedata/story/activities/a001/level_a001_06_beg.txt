Big Bob:
A few years ago, we became the Infected.

Big Bob:
We were forced to live among the shadows. Overnight, peace became a luxury for us.

Big Bob:
Originally, we thought that the Reunion Movement would be able to change our lives, but...

Big Bob:
Still, nobody would sell us bread or provide us shelter. Nothing had changed at all.

Big Bob:
My brothers and I left, and we drifted from place to place until we heard about the treasure. That is what brought me here.

Big Bob:
This time, if we're able to get our hands on the treasure...

Big Bob:
We'd be able to travel to Columbia, far, far away. There, the Infected can form communities and even own land.

Big Bob:
That is why... Grani, for my brothers, I need this treasure.

Big Bob:
It's not far... I can feel it. You did well, but it's a shame...

Reunion Member:
Hey, lady! You...!

Skadi:
Out of my way.

Reunion Member:
Woah!!

Big Bob:
...

Skadi:
I don't care who you are, or what you plan on doing.

Skadi:
But you shall disappear from my sight.

Big Bob:
If there's really no other way, Skadi... then I'll fight you to the very end.

Skadi:
So these are the types of people you've chosen to ally yourself with?

Grani:
What will happen to Dewville after you take the treasure?

Big Bob:
No matter what happens, they will still survive. The same cannot be said for us.

Big Bob:
Even though I haven't known you for long, I can tell what kind of person you are.

Big Bob:
You aren't prejudiced against the Infected, unlike that monster standing next to you.

Grani:
(Skadi probably isn't prejudiced either... She just wants you out of her way, Infected or not...)

Big Bob:
Grani, tell me where Carol is!

Big Bob:
You know how much this treasure means to us!

Grani:
Sorry, Big Bob, but that's not a part of my mission.

Grani:
My only mission is to help Carol find the treasure, and restore peace to her village.

Skadi:
I don't care about any of that. Just hand Carol over to me.

Big Bob:
What do you need that girl for anyway, you monster?

Big Bob:
Do you plan to skin her alive? Drink her blood?

Big Bob:
You already heard the kid. She won't hand the chief over to you no matter what!

Big Bob:
However, I just want the treasure. I won't lay a finger on the girl!

Skadi:
I've had enough of this... Grani, tell me where Carol is.

Grani:
All Carol wants is to protect her village. She doesn't even care about the treasure itself.

Big Bob:
In that case, let me have the treasure then!

Skadi:
There is little difference between Reunion and the bounty hunters.

Big Bob:
I'm nothing like you greed-driven lot!

Big Bob:
I used to be a good-for-nothing just like you, but I've seen the world for what it is.

Big Bob:
Right now, things like status or wealth aren't worth shit.

Big Bob:
All we want is to survive, and the treasure is going to make that happen!

Skadi:
I'll say it one more time. Hand Carol over to me.

Grani:
I won't hand over Carol, or the treasure.

Grani:
This is my mission.

Big Bob:
Grani! You still have a choice! I don't want to fight you when it doesn't do either of us any good!

Big Bob:
Just let me have the treasure, and everyone walks away happy!

Grani:
We already agreed that we'd give you a share of the treasure, Big Bob!

Big Bob:
But think about my brothers! At least let me see how much treasure there is first!

Skadi:
If we have to resort to violence, both of you know that you're no match for me.

Grani:
I might not be confident in my abilities, but if I have to fight both of you, then so be it!

Big Bob:
At least the two of us can talk things through, Grani!

Grani:
No.

Big Bob:
Then, let's team up and take her down first!

Skadi:
Are you done talking?

Grani:
If we start fighting here, then there really will be no turning back!

Big Bob:
We...

???:
Grani!

???:
Look, I found the it! I found the treasure!

Carol:
It was really hard to drag it all the way out here...

Carol:
Mister Bob!

Carol:
I'm glad that you're okayâ€”

Grani:
Stay back!

Carol:
Huh? !

Skadi:
...Tsk!

Big Bob:
*huff*...*huff*...

Big Bob:
There was... never any turning back for us!

Grani:
Huh? Carol!

Grani:
Skadi!

Skadi:
Why did you use a non-damaging explosive?

Big Bob:
I owe these girls a favor.

Big Bob:
But next time, I'll be using the real ones.

Grani:
Skadi...

Grani:
You don't care about the treasure. Nor do you want to hurt Miss Carol.

Skadi:
...

Grani:
That's why you shielded her instead of grabbing the treasure and making a run for it.

Skadi:
I'm not after the treasure. What I want is the answer that Carol holds.

Grani:
Why didn't you say so in the first place?!

Grani:
What's the point of playing the villain anyway? Wouldn't kill you to be a bit more frank.

Skadi:
I don't want... for others to get caught up in my mission.

Skadi:
But the mission objective this time... is very important to me.

Grani:
Of course, I can imagine. Even though we have different missions, we're working towards the same thing, right?

Grani:
We should be helping each other out instead!

Skadi:
Tch.

Grani:
I guess we're going to have to fight over the treasure after all.

Grani:
Skadi, make sure not to hurt him too badly!

Big Bob:
Gra...ni...!

Grani:
I'm really sorry, Big Bob, but this might hurt a little!
