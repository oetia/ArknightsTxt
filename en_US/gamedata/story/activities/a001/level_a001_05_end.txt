Grani:
Gah...!

Bounty Hunter:
You... You meddling brat!

Bounty Hunter:
Your head's practically split open, just do what's good for you and get out of our way!

Grani:
Heh, this is nothing. I've been through worse in my daily training!

Bounty Hunter:
Guh—

Grani:
How many of them are left...?

Grani:
Forget it, I lost track. As long as they don't make it inside...

Grani:
E-Earthquake?

Grani:
Huh? Is that an avalanche over there? Why though?

Skadi:
...

Grani:
You've gotta be kidding... She can even smash through a stone wall that thick?

Bounty Hunter:
A new entrance opened up over there! Hurry, let's go in there!

Grani:
Damn it, those guys are definitely going to swarm in through that new passageway Skadi just created!

Grani:
I have to find Carol—

Skadi:
Stop right there.

Grani:
Skadi...

Grani:
...

Grani:
Unbelievable... Not even a mountain can stand in her way. Those rumors really were true.

Skadi:
Where's the girl?

Grani:
I'm not telling you.

Skadi:
I'm not the only one after that... thing.

Skadi:
You ought to cooperate before I'm forced to do things the hard way.

Grani:
I can't just hand Carol over to you if you don't tell me what's going on!

Skadi:
So... you intend to impede a mission from Rhodes Island?

Grani:
What mission? You didn't even tell me anything about that!

Grani:
Unless you...

Grani:
Hey, don't just start swinging at your comrades!

Skadi:
I'm not your comrade.

Skadi:
This is your last chance. Take me to see that girl.

Grani:
No chance in hell. My mission is to keep her safe.

Skadi:
...

Grani:
Aaaaghh...

Grani:
Damn... All she did was tap her sword against my lance, but it feels like my arm is about to snap...

Skadi:
Do you think you can really protect her with abilities of this caliber?

Grani:
Whether or not I can... has nothing to do with whether or not I will!

Skadi:
...

Grani:
Huh? Wait a second!

Grani:
Watch out!

Bounty Hunter:
Tch, that ought to have done the trick!

Violent Bounty Hunter:
Yeah, we... no, we didn't get her?! She's still unscathed!

Skadi:
...You again?

Bounty Hunter:
Gah...!

Violent Bounty Hunter:
The l-living Catastrophe! You're the one who hurt the captain! We can't let you leave alive—

Grani:
Now's my chance!

Bounty Hunter:
Don't you even think about it!

Grani:
You guys really should worry about holding her back first!

Bounty Hunter:
...Huh?

Bounty Hunter:
What just happened? ! That kid just vaulted over our heads?

Grani:
See you later, Skadi!

Skadi:
You...

Grani:
Sorry! When you're ready to explain to me what's going on, maybe then we can talk about Carol!

Skadi:
Stop, get back here!

Grani:
Sorry again!

Violent Bounty Hunter:
How could you just let her go like that?!

Bounty Hunter:
She's too fast for us to catch!

Skadi:
...

Violent Bounty Hunter:
Whatever, let's just deal with this one first.

Violent Bounty Hunter:
With how much bigger you are, I bet you can't leap over us.

Skadi:
...You're all dead.

Grani:
It really is like a maze in here with all these winding paths. Carol was right.

Grani:
Hmm? What's a bounty hunter doing here—

Bounty Hunter:
Ugh... save me...

Bounty Hunter:
...

Grani:
Poor guy...

Grani:
He looks like he got pummeled a few times...

Grani:
B-but Skadi is still outside the cave, right?

Grani:
What's this opening? It looks like the wall was blasted open...

Grani:
That must mean—

Grani:
You already figured it out.

???:
......

???:
I'm a pretty good actor, right?

Grani:
So it was your doing...
