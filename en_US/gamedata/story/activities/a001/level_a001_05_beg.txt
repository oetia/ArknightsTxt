Grani:
So, this really is the only entrance to the cave, huh?

Carol:
Mhm. It's like a maze inside the cave, but the village elders have brought me here several times before, including when I succeeded the previous chief...

Carol:
...Um, I might just be imagining things, but don't you think the shouts from inside the forest are getting louder...?

Grani:
Things are only going to get worse if we run into any more delays.

Grani:
Carol, you know your way around inside the cave, right? I'd like you to go inside and retrieve the treasure right now.

Carol:
Huh? What about you...

Grani:
I'll stay at the entrance.

Carol:
No way!

Grani:
Huh? Carol...

Carol:
You're going to face the bounty hunters alone? That's too dangerous! You'll be...

Grani:
If I can't help you secure that treasure, I'd be letting down the entire village, and you as well.

Carol:
...But, I don't want to lose you.

Carol:
This... isn't the time or place for you to be playing hero...!

Grani:
What's wrong with playing the hero?

Grani:
'Even with their hearts impaled by the enemy's blades, the King's knights still held on to their spears.'

Grani:
I refuse to run away.

Carol:
Grani...

Grani:
Besides, Carol, this isn't just my battle.

Grani:
It's also your battle. Perhaps you will run into dangers along the way, but as long as we can restore peace to this land...

Grani:
We must face our duties head-on.

Grani:
I trust that you'll find the treasure.

Carol:
But... if I'm alone...

Carol:
The treasure...

Grani:
Trust me.

Grani:
No matter what, I'll protect you. Back when I rescued you, I promised that nobody would ever hurt you again.

Grani:
Not even a single strand of hair on your head.

Carol:
Even though you're just a kid...

Grani:
I'm no such thing... I'm just vertically challenged!

Carol:
Haha!

Carol:
...Mm, I'll do as you said, Grani.

Bounty Hunter:
Those damn whitemasks... Why do they always show up at the worst times?!

Reunion Member:
Worthless scum, all of you.

Reunion Member:
You don't even have the right to challenge us for the treasure.

Bounty Hunter:
Haaah? What are you talking about? This has long been our turn, so you'd better get lost, or else!

Grani:
(From this angle, I can see the fighting... It seems that the bounty hunters have gotten into a brawl with Reunion.)

Grani:
(No matter who approaches this cave, I'll make sure I...)

Bounty Hunter:
Let's make a run for the cave while those imbeciles duke it out!

Bounty Hunter:
Wait, what's that kid doing there?!

Grani:
You shall not pass.

Bounty Hunter:
Gwaah...!

Bounty Hunter:
You, it's youâ€”

Skadi:
Out of my way, all of you.

Skadi:
I'm not in the mood to play around.
