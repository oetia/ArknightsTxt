Mt. Terrat tunnel

Big Bob:
We'll be safe after we enter this tunnel. At the other end of this tunnel is Mt. Mortica, which won't have very many bounty hunters.

Big Bob:
As for that Skadi... I used to scoff at those rumors that described her as a living avalanche. Turns out, I learned the truth today.

Big Bob:
I was expecting her to be a bit stronger than your average shmuck, but those rumors turned out to not be exaggerated after all.

Big Bob:
No wonder why the guys at the bar always looked at me like I'm crazy when I laughed at them for being terrified of her.

Big Bob:
Now it's my turn to be terrified, hah.

Grani:
It's true! I heard those same rumors going around in Rhodes Island too.

Grani:
I've also never been sent on a mission with her before. I knew that she was really powerful, but I never expected this to happen...

Grani:
I didn't even know that she was a bounty hunter before.

Big Bob:
She's one of the most infamous bounty hunters out there.

Big Bob:
Now that she's also after the treasure, we're going to have our work cut out for us.

Big Bob:
I have no idea if the two of us will be able to beat her to it.

Carol:
If that's the case, does that mean my village...

Big Bob:
Don't worry. I think she'll drive the rest of the bounty hunters away.

Big Bob:
Though... she might destroy a few villages in the process.

Carol:
Ugh...

Grani:
I don't think she's here for the treasure. I can't let something like that happen.

Big Bob:
So, your Rhodes Island or whatever, will hire just about anyone?

Grani:
No Rhodes Island operator would ever harm others recklessly for their own selfish gain.

Big Bob:
Hmph. Well, you seem nice enough, and even did me a favor. However, the fact that your Rhodes Island is enabling Skadi, an entity who knows only destruction, makes me question whether your organization truly seeks to help the Infected.

Big Bob:
Furthermore, as someone stricken with Oripathy, I've never seen Rhodes Island do anything to help those like me. We're still abused wherever we go.

Grani:
Big Bob...

Big Bob:
What, got nothing to say to that? Honestly, I have no idea why you have so much faith in an organization like that.

Big Bob:
As far as I can tell, their claim of wanting to help the Infected is just lip service. In the end, all they see is money.

Big Bob:
Hmph, what's the deal with Rhodes Island anyway? In this world, there's nothing that speaks louder than the coins in my hand!

Grani:
Sorry...

Big Bob:
What are you apologizing for? You're still a kid, and you still can't tell between ideals and reality, nor do you know your worth. But all of this is perfectly normal.

Grani:
No, that's not what I meant. I know that I'm still lacking.

Grani:
It's just that... whether as a police officer, or as an operator, I've met a lot of Infected.

Grani:
...I wasn't able to save them all, because I was lacking.

Grani:
Rhodes Island is the same.

Big Bob:
In other words, they're useless? Hah!

Big Bob:
That's right. When the Infected were slaving away underground, locked away in remote places, or being killed for no reason, where was Rhodes Island?

Grani:
Even when we try our hardest, we sometimes still come up short. That's true for both me and for Rhodes Island.

Grani:
Despite that, I'll never give up on any innocent Infected who I see.

Grani:
Rhodes Island is the same.

Big Bob:
Tch.

Grani:
Sorry, Big Bob...

Big Bob:
...I told you, you're just a kid. What good does it do to hammer you with my grievances?

Big Bob:
But that Skadi, your coworker, would not hesitate to point her weapon at you, or abduct Carol to seize the treasure.

Big Bob:
Can you say with confidence that someone like that would share your ideals and work with you to help the Infected?

Grani:
I don't know what Skadi plans on doing, so I can't answer that.

Grani:
However, I trust that if Rhodes Island took her in, then she must have her reasons.

Big Bob:
You can forget my rambling then. I overstepped my bounds.

Grani:
It's okay.

Grani:
Anyway, our priority right now is to help Miss Carol find the treasure.

Big Bob:
I'm just dead weight now, with this injured leg. Heh, I never thought I'd be the one burdening two little girls.

Grani:
Big Bob, we'll only consider you a burden on one condition...

Grani:
...and that's if you don't plan on sharing the treasure with us.

Big Bob:
Oh? Hahaha!

Carol:
Mister Bob, I wasn't disgusted by your condition. It's just that... I was a bit scared.

Carol:
I'm from the sticks, and I haven't seen many Infected people. But even I can tell... that you've endured a lot of hardship.

Carol:
I apologize if I was rude to you before.

Big Bob:
Don't worry about it. Heh, as long as we find the treasure and you get me my share, I'll be a happy camper.

Carol:
Mhm... The treasure is important to our village, but we only need enough to resolve our problems. Mister Bob, you'll be able to get your fair share.

Carol:
That's why Grani and I need help, and will aid you as well.

Carol:
Right, Grani?

Grani:
Of course. In any case, we need to get moving soon.

Big Bob:
Our next destination should be Mt. Mortica. That mountain was named after some knight who died long ago.

Big Bob:
If my intuition is correct, then that should be where the treasure is located, right?

Carol:
However, there are a lot of caves up ahead. It'd take an average person weeks to search them all.

Big Bob:
Of course. That's why we can't do this without you. There's no way we're going to hand you to that red-eyed woman.

Carol:
Please lead the way then.

Big Bob:
Sounds like a plan.

Big Bob:
Wait a moment.

Big Bob:
There's some movement near the tunnel's exit...

???:
Aaaaghâ€”

'Captain':
Someone... help... save me...

'Captain':
It's... the Infected...

Reunion Member A:
...What'd you do to him?

Reunion Member B:
I didn't even do anything. He just tripped over himself...

Reunion Member B:
Huh.

Reunion Member A:
...

Grani:
They're... from Reunion?

Big Bob:
You guys...

Grani:
Big Bob, what are you doing?

Grani:
These guys aren't your ordinary...

Big Bob:
Say no more. We're going to have to fight!

Reunion Member:
...

Reunion Member:
Quick, capture them before they get away!
