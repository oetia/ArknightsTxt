Bounty Hunter:
Stop her!

Violent Bounty Hunter:
Stop that monster? Look at how many people she's already taken out!

Bounty Hunter:
Why not? You're always going on about how strong you are!

Violent Bounty Hunter:
I-I can't do it! She's a walking Catastrophe, can't you see?

???:
......

???:
(Ægirian) All that standeth before me shall perish.

???:
(Ægirian) All that beareth arms against me shall return to dust.

???:
(Ægirian) All that craveth death, step forth.

'Captain':
What the hell are you mumbling about?

Bounty Hunter:
Huh? Captain? Where'd the captain go?

Violent Bounty Hunter:
The captain fell into the river...!

Bounty Hunter:
She... she sent him flying with just a single blow...

???:
Ah, I forgot they can't understand me... Oh well.

???:
Tell me, where is she?

Bounty Hunter:
She? Who are you talking about? Don't ask me, I don't know anything!

Bounty Hunter:
Gyaaah!!!

Violent Bounty Hunter:
You... you'll regret this!

Violent Bounty Hunter:
Hey! Don't just start running! Pull the captain out of the river first!

Grani:
That person...

Carol:
Do you know her?

Grani:
She might be my coworker...

Grani:
But, wasn't I the one who was appointed to this job? It took me forever to pry this job from Meteorite too...

Grani:
Hrmmm... Maybe she's here on another mission?

Carol:
Well, seems like the bounty hunters are retreating?

Grani:
It's now or never. This is our chance to get out of the village.

Grani:
If there are other operators coming to the village, we might even have the upper hand.

Grani:
Carol, the staircase is really dark. You should hold on to me.

Carol:
Um, will you stop to talk to her?

Grani:
Hmm, if possible, then I might—

???:
Yeeowwwwch—!

Grani:
Wooooahh!

Bounty Hunter:
My nose... my nose...! How'd this door spring open on its own...

Grani:
Huh? Why is someone crouching here...

Carol:
Grani! What's going on—

Violent Bounty Hunter:
Everyone, shut up! Shhhh!

Grani:
...Shush?

Bounty Hunter:
Yeah, you peasants couldn't possibly understand. Did you not see that walking Catastrophe?!

Bounty Hunter:
No bounty hunter would be stupid enough to face her head-on! The only people foolish enough to swagger up to her are those who haven't seen her level entire cities!

Grani:
Wow, did she really! You mean she can do that all by herself—

Violent Bounty Hunter:
Quiet, don't let her hear us!

Grani:
You know, I was hoping she'd notice me—

Violent Bounty Hunter:
I said be quiet!

Grani:
Fine, fine...

Grani:
Somehow these stories about her that are going around are even more outrageous than the ones we hear at Rhodes Island...

Bounty Hunter:
D-did that monster leave?

Violent Bounty Hunter:
I.. I think so...!

Bounty Hunter:
Phew, she's finally gone... Nearly gave me a heart attack...

Grani:
Y-yeah.

Violent Bounty Hunter:
I thought just our team would be enough to handle this job, but how'd we get ourselves into this mess... How do we even deal with something like that—

Violent Bounty Hunter:
—Wait a sec!

Grani:
Oops.

Violent Bounty Hunter:
Ahh! You're that kid with the spear! Fancy running into you here!

Violent Bounty Hunter:
And the Chief's with you too! You delivered her right to us!

Carol:
Grani, don't tell me you...

Grani:
No no, they just seemed to be so well-behaved, I let my guard down!

Bounty Hunter:
Cut the chatter, and hand the chief over to us! Otherwise, you're gonna be talking to the business end of this blade real soon!

Grani:
You mean with that little knife?

Bounty Hunter:
......Wh-when did that kid pull that spear out?!

Violent Bounty Hunter:
Send the signal and call the others!

Violent Bounty Hunter:
Also, go release the rest of those bugs that we used to destroy their crops. We'll show them what happens when they try to resist us!
