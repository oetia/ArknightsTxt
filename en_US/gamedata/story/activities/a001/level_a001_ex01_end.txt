...We should stuff him into a sack...

...and hang him on the mast at dawn...

...We should slit his throat...

...and offer him to the ocean as a tribute to the raging hurricane...

Specter:
Ugh!

Specter:
...that same dream again.

???:
......

Specter:
Who is it?

Specter:
...Oh, it's just you. Hm, I can't even seem to remember your name.

???:
That doesn't matter. Just treat me like any normal Rhodes Island operator.

???:
You look like you're in pain.

Specter:
It's just another nightmare.

Specter:
Dark fragments swirling in my consciousness, hidden beneath the shadows of that broken church...

Specter:
When I approach them, they turn into shackles and drag me down into the deep sea.

???:
......

???:
But soon, there will be a way to escape your torment.

Specter:
Heh, is that so? That'd be great. But why should I trust you?

Specter:
Heh.

Specter:
Your aura... I'm quite familiar with it.

Specter:
No, it's your smell. It's an intense, pungent smell... the smell of blood... 'their' smell. The smell of the deep sea.

Specter:
It's a familiar and abhorrent smell.

???:
Is that so?

Specter:
Can you tell me your name?

Skadi:
Skadi.

Specter:
Interesting. So, why did you decide to show up here?

Specter:
You're not supposed to be here without permission from Kal'tsit, unless you're not afraid of me ripping you to pieces.

Skadi:
I am afraid. Just like everyone else. However, I'm used to fear.

Skadi:
It's time to go. By the time I come back, things may have already moved forward. However, you can forget all about me, just like before.

Specter:
Where are you going?

Skadi:
To where the secret is buried.

Skadi:
A place far, far away from you.
