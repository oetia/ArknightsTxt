Big Bob:
Ngh...

Reunion Member:
This one's limping! Take him out first!

Big Bob:
Grani! At this rate, we're all gonna be dead meat!

Grani:
Even if that's the case...!

Big Bob:
Quick! Take Carol and go!

Big Bob:
I'll only end up slowing you down with this bad leg!

Big Bob:
I'll find a way to meet up with you later! Hurry!

Grani:
...

Grani:
It's a promise then! Make sure to come get your share of the treasure!

Big Bob:
...Heh.

Big Bob:
Just go!

Reunion Member:
They ran away!

Big Bob:
All right, who wants to play?

Grani:
...The sounds of fighting are quieting down.

Grani:
But we can't afford to rest yet, Carol. Sorry...

Carol:
I'm fine... But, Mister Bob... what about him...?!

Grani:
He might need some time.

Carol:
Need some time...? Are you saying...

Carol:
Oww!

Grani:
Carol! Are you okay?

Carol:
Sorry, I just tripped over this root...

Grani:
Here, take my hand.

Carol:
...Thank you.

Grani:
Can you walk?

Carol:
...I'm fine, it's just a bruise. As you said, it's best that we keep moving...

Carol:
Once we cross this forest, we'll reach the foot of Mt. Mortica. We need to find the second cave halfway up the mountain.

Grani:
We can only get in through the cave entrance?

Carol:
Yeah. Once inside, we'll still have to follow some paths in the darkness, but I know the way. The treasure is hidden in the deepest part of the cave.

Grani:
Mhm. Well, in that case...

Carol:
Woah?! Was that an explosion going off in the distance...? Th-that can't be good...

Grani:
Listen closely, there's the sound of screaming as well.

Grani:
Someone's fighting. It's not over yet.

Grani:
...Carol, are you scared?

Carol:
I'm...

Carol:
...Yes, I am.

Carol:
But in order to protect my village and return peace to these lands... I have to do this.

Grani:
I see...

Grani:
You're really brave.

Carol:
Huh?

Grani:
Don't worry about it. Anyway, let's keep moving.
