Skadi:
Stop right there, Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
You're back.

Kal'tsit:
So, did you think things through, or...?

Skadi:
You wanted this, right? Take it.

Kal'tsit:
You acted unilaterally, without permission.

Kal'tsit:
I do not interfere in the private affairs of our operators, nor do I ask them what they did in their free time - as long as they do not tarnish Rhodes Island's reputation.

Kal'tsit:
I hope that whatever you did does not cost you your position in Rhodes Island, Skadi.

Skadi:
I'm not here for your snide remarks. I'm well aware of the rules. You needed something from me, and I need something from you.

Kal'tsit:
What do you want from me then?

Skadi:
Information.

Kal'tsit:
Do you consider the information I have to be worth as little as this key?

Skadi:
I can crush this stone in my palm in a heartbeat. I'm sure you don't want that.

Kal'tsit:
What I do know is that you went to Dewville in Kazimierz under pretenses of being on a mission, and even got into a conflict with a fellow operator.

Kal'tsit:
She kept quiet about what happened both there and at Rhodes Island for your sake. But in fact, I never assigned any such mission to you.

Kal'tsit:
Hmm? The core has already been filled with blood. This is not your blood. You wouldn't dare shed your own blood onto this soil.

Skadi:
It's Grani's blood.

Kal'tsit:
You've already done something like this...

Skadi:
I'll repay her. You don't need to remind me.

Skadi:
I know this is what you need. A key, a core, a memory block... whatever it might be. I just have to obtain it.

Skadi:
'Skull,' 'Flamelung,' 'Yellow Smog'... I took them all out.

Skadi:
Otherwise, they surely would have taken this item. You wouldn't be able to barter with them, because you can't give them what they want.

Skadi:
You need this 'stone,' and I need the information you have.

Kal'tsit:
What a farce. I don't need any of these... components... to form the full picture.

Kal'tsit:
You're bound to Rhodes Island by contract, and you're bound to me likewise.

Skadi:
You give me what I need, and I give you what you need.

Kal'tsit:
I rarely see you this aggressive. Where's your usual laziness and snark?

Kal'tsit:
You want to know where Spectre's Originium nerve agent came from.

Skadi:
...How'd you find out?

Kal'tsit:
(Ã†girian) 'Abyssal Hunters are bound by blood.'

Kal'tsit:
There's nothing I don't know.

Skadi:
...Give me the info.

Kal'tsit:
Very well. As long as you follow my every order, I might even decide to help you. The condition is, as long as you follow my every order.

Skadi:
I only follow those who are trustworthy.

Kal'tsit:
I never go back on my word.
