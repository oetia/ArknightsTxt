Bounty Hunter:
Ngh...

Bounty Hunter:
You... you took out all my buddies?

Bounty Hunter:
...S-stay away from me! I'm begging you!

Bounty Hunter:
I, I'll give you all my coins! My weapons! Anything you want...

???:
Where's the girl?

Bounty Hunter:
What are you talking about...?

Bounty Hunter:
Don't come any closer...!

Bounty Hunter:
You monster—!

Clear \ Visibility: 14 km

Forest at the foot of Mt. Terrat

Big Bob:
This rock...

Big Bob:
Stay close to me, you two. Watch your step, and stay inside my footprints. Don't go around touching things either.

Big Bob:
I'm afraid this forest is even more dangerous than we suspected.

Grani:
Is something carved on that rock?

Big Bob:
These are marks left behind by bounty hunters. We need to take heed of these, or we may well end up stepping in a trap.

Grani:
So, how are we going to avoid the traps?

Big Bob:
Just watch me.

Big Bob:
An animal trap on a rope... how old-fashioned.

Big Bob:
Here's a rolling log trap, hidden by the foliage. Would've tripped it if we rushed forward.

Big Bob:
Miss Carol, watch your step.

Carol:
Uh, huh?

Big Bob:
If you take another step in that direction, there's probably a spiked pitfall waiting for you.

Carol:
Oh...!

Grani:
You sure are the real deal. You're pretty good at this.

Big Bob:
Of course. After all, I used to...

Big Bob:
...

Big Bob:
It's not realistic to go around all the traps. Looks like we'll have to disarm some of them after all.

Big Bob:
The most perilous path for them will soon become the safest path for us.

Big Bob:
Let's go.

Big Bob:
Wait.

Big Bob:
Something's not right here.

Grani:
Is it a trap?

Big Bob:
No...

Big Bob:
A symbol drawn with blood...

Big Bob:
'...Monster?'

Big Bob:
What's the meaning of this? In all my years, I've never seen a symbol like this.

Grani:
...Oh...

Grani:
Is this what I think it is...

Bounty Hunter:
Monster... Monster!

Bounty Hunter:
D-don't come this way!

???:
......

Grani:
...

???:
......

Grani:
It was you!

Grani:
Skadi, you're Skadi, right?

Skadi:
...So, the chief of Dewville was with you?

Grani:
Huh? You know Carol...?

Skadi:
Hand her over to me. Now.

Big Bob:
Grani, something's not right about her eyes.

Grani:
I can't just do that. Let's talk this over peacefully—

Grani:
H-huh?

Grani:
Oww!

Skadi:
That was just a warning.

Grani:
No! Miss Carol, Big Bob...

Big Bob:
Wh-why would she attack you?

Big Bob:
You know each other right, so why—

Grani:
No time to explain! Run for it!

Grani:
*gasp* *gasp*... Is she still after us?

Carol:
G-Grani... I, I can't run for any longer...

Big Bob:
That woman... is she really a monster? She's not even short of breath!

Skadi:
Why must I waste my time on you?

Grani:
She's really gonna kill me! Whoa, what is she doing to Miss Carol?

Carol:
Her eyes, they're so red... G-Grani!

Grani:
No, no, no! This can't be happening!

Grani:
Stop!

Big Bob:
Ambush!

'Captain':
Now! Fiiire!

Skadi:
Hmm?

'Captain':
That's her right there, the walking Catastrophe! Hurry, shoot her down!

Grani:
Stop it!

'Captain':
What do you think you're doing, kid?

Grani:
I don't know why she's after us, but she's still my coworker!

'Captain':
G-get out of my way, you rascal—!

Skadi:
...

Grani:
Hurry up and run!

Big Bob:
—There's an opening to the east! Hurry!

Bounty Hunter:
No way we're letting you escape! Die, monster!!

Skadi:
(Ægirian) Scatter and fall!
