Grani:
We're in the clear!

Grani:
You okay, Big Bobâ€”

Grani:
Huh? That wound on your leg...

Bounty Hunter:
There are some stragglers over there! They're probably from the Valk Vanguards!

Big Bob:
I can handle this on my own! Go after the ones who are fleeing!

Grani:
Sure.

Bounty Hunter:
Hmm?

Bounty Hunter:
This kid...

Bounty Hunter:
Hey, hey, why are you giving me that look?

Bounty Hunter:
G-get away from me or I'll put a hole through you!

Bounty Hunter:
Huh?

Big Bob:
You took care of them all?

Grani:
That's right.

Big Bob:
Impressive. This kid's got talent.

Grani:
Stay there and don't move. I'll patch you up.

Big Bob:
It's fine, I can take care of myself.

Grani:
No means no.

Big Bob:
You saw it, right?

Grani:
Mhm.

Big Bob:
You saw the crystalization on my body, right? Are you trying to get yourself infected?!

Grani:
Our mission at Rhodes Island is to help all the Infected.

Big Bob:
Rhodes Island...

Carol:
Rhodes Island? Aren't you from Victoria...?

Grani:
Former Victoria Mounted Police. Now, I'm a Rhodes Island operator!

Big Bob:
Stay back, lass. I'm an Infected.

Carol:
I...

Grani:
Miss Carol, this might get a bit messy. You should step back a bit.

Grani:
All right, I stopped the bleeding.

Big Bob:
You do this a lot, huh? For the Infected?

Big Bob:
You're not afraid of me...

Grani:
A lot of my coworkers are already Infected, but I can't tell who is and who isn't.

Big Bob:
Huh?

Grani:
Well, it's sometimes hard to tell until it's time to hit the showers, right?

Big Bob:
...Hmph.

Big Bob:
Thanks, shorty. You're naive, but you're a good person.

Big Bob:
...
