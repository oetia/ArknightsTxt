Reunion Caster:
W, we're in trouble here.

W:
Ooh... Must be something fun for you to contact me on this channel. What's up?

Reunion Caster:
Not that much fun, W. While you were sorting out that Sarkaz mercenary, one of our teams deserted.

Reunion Caster:
They looked like some kind of battlefield mop up logistics team, so we got after them right away.

Reunion Caster:
They scattered as soon as we made contact, making for the city limits.

W:
Sounds like somebody earned a cookie.

Reunion Caster:
There's more... The squad we sent after them fell off the grid too. We haven't been able to make contact.

Reunion Caster:
I thought maybe you'd know what happened, since you're leading the mercenaries now.

Reunion Caster:
How does a squad suddenly vanish?

01:13 P.M. \ Clear

Chernobog - Outskirts - Wilderness

W:
Am I supposed to understand this?

Reunion Caster:
It is what it is. Other teams report no sign of any enemy ambush or trap. We only know they were facing a Sarkaz.

W:
Of course they're Sarkaz. It's not like I've got any other mercs. But anyway, this is a good story. Keep going.

Reunion Caster:
At first contact, we managed to suppress the target. Playing it safe, we held back our squads. The enemy did not appear particularly strong.

Reunion Caster:
Then, suddenly, all communications ceased.

W:
...Yeah, you guys tip your hand pretty easily. A real predator knows not to bare his fangs too soon.

Reunion Caster:
What should we do?

W:
Well what's so special about those Sarkaz?

Reunion Caster:
...I'm not sure. We lost contact with the eyewitnesses. But from a distance, all we know is they have a close quarters fighter who really likes to get up in there.

W:
Then I need you to avoid direct contact with them. Stall that one, I'll be there in a bit.

Reunion Blademaster:
Something the matter?

W:
Nothing. Just a little baby squad that made good bait.

Reunion Blademaster:
Should we move to support them?

W:
C'mon, everyone's got a job to do. Why can't we just let everybody handle their own thing?

W:
Yeah... Let's not think too hard about this one. I do care so much about the Sarkaz weirdos my poor predecessor brought along.

Reunion Blademaster:
Understood.

Reunion Blademaster:
Inform all squads: prepare for battle, move to the outskirts of the city.

Reunion Caster:
Agh, damn it! This bastard's moving even faster! Is he still hiding his true power?!

???:
...Pathetic. Is this the best your Reunion Movement has to offer?

Reunion Caster:
This cocky...! He's making fun of us——

W:
Heh...

W:
I knew I'd run into some old friends here, but I never thought I'd see you.

Reunion Caster:
W, we——

W:
Go home, before you get killed. Don't give me that look like you wanna get even. He's not even using a fraction of his full power. But hey, if you wanna die that bad, I guess I won't get in your way?

Reunion Caster:
...fall back.

W:
It's been a while, wandering swordmaster.

Flamebringer:
You——

W:
They call me W now.

W:
How about you?

Flamebringer:
Flamebringer. Surely you know what it means to exchange names with me.

W:
Oooh, spooky. So you traded business cards with all those dudes you sliced up before?

Flamebringer:
Commissions and combat are not the same.

W:
A Sarkaz like you, having been through a battle like that, suddenly up and vanishing, it makes a girl worry.

W:
And a mercenary running off just because he's got a new leader? That's a little wobbly, isn't it?

Flamebringer:
That is utterly insignificant.

Flamebringer:
Though I never imagined your subordinates would be so unworthy, unfit to even hear my name.

W:
Then I guess I should be honored... Oh, but those men weren't under me very long. Ah, are you inviting me to kill you?

Flamebringer:
No, I have no interest in your petty fighting style. It relies so much on outside forces.

Flamebringer:
But I have to admit, tactics are a kind of skill. Then if your tactics are more elegant than they used to be, I am willing to taste them.

W:
...That's weird. Weren't you one of those 'as long as the target dies, anything goes' types?

Reunion Blademaster:
W, the squad has fallen back to the target location and successfully cut off the enemy retreat. They have nowhere to go.

Flamebringer:
And I never expected you would be leading this band of mooks. We've all changed a lot.

W:
Mooks? Oh... you mean Reunion?

W:
Or do you mean... the Sarkaz?

Reunion Blademaster:
Gah——!

Flamebringer:
Hmph.

Reunion Blademaster:
I won't underestimate you, Sarkaz, I've been watching you.

Reunion Blademaster:
Too bad. You're out of options.

Flamebringer:
Is that how it is? I guess you are too.

Flamebringer:
Isn't this much more fun? Now you're my whetstone. And my blade is a bit dull.

Reunion Blademaster:
Really? You're still talking big?

Flamebringer:
Right. Come on.

Reunion Blademaster:
Agh! Shit! How are you——

Reunion Blademaster:
Gaaaah——!

Flamebringer:
You're still talking?

W:
...He's even stronger. Not that I'm surprised.

Reunion Caster:
W! Why are we just standing here watching?! Just give the order and we'll turn him to dust!

W:
So now I get to boss you around again?

Reunion Caster:
Now's not the time for this!

W:
But I'm really not your commander.

W:
Here's an idea. Back up, don't provoke him, and pick another time to get yourself killed.

Reunion Blademaster:
...Damn it.

W:
Right? You really thought you were gonna step up and pick a fight with him? Is this open mic night?

Reunion Blademaster:
Tsk...

Flamebringer:
Who's next?

W:
Where's the fire? You got somewhere to be?

Flamebringer:
This isn't the first time I've been surrounded.

W:
Right right. Let's see, are you talking about that civil war? Sounds like a good story. Tell it for us?

Flamebringer:
What's to tell? They ambushed me. They're all dead. I'm still alive. That's the story.

Flamebringer:
What do you think? Should I keep going?

Flamebringer:
That fight just now was nothing for me. I need so much more.

W:
No... I'm just thinking like, why don't you join us?

Reunion Caster:
W?! He's a traitor. Look how many of us he's killed——

W:
It was my mercenaries who decided to use him. He'd be good for Reunion. Got a problem?

Reunion Caster:
Yes!

Flamebringer:
......

W:
I mean, think about it. We have so much more fun over here! War, bloodshed, and all those Sarkaz buddies...

W:
Everything you're looking for, we got here on a silver platter.

W:
I'm speaking to you from the heart here. We have so much in common, you and I.

Flamebringer:
I don't think so.

W:
You're Infected, right? You'd fit right in with Reunion! What's the problem?

Flamebringer:
Wanton destruction, organized savagery, I fail to see what I could get from a group like this.

Flamebringer:
You call this war? This is just the strike of a match flaming out. You should know what a real war looks like.

W:
Don't talk like that. We've got serious, hardworking folks here too. Lots of diversity in Reunion.

W:
Like, my old boss was kind of a purist, but I'm the type who finds joy in everything.

Flamebringer:
If I could make a request... Then I would like to taste Talulah's swordsmanship.

W:
The dragon lady? I mean, I don't wanna talk her up too much, but you don't have a snowball's chance in hell of beating her.

W:
And like, could we even call her thing swordsmanship? You'd be a pile of dust before you even got close to her.

Flamebringer:
I know.

Flamebringer:
Of course, I also know that if I refuse you, the odds of me escaping this city alive are just as small.

Flamebringer:
So what have I got to lose? If I don't push myself to break the chains of complacency, how can I ever improve?

W:
Huh... when did you become so sentimental?

Flamebringer:
I seek only the meaning of life.

W:
Right. Whatever you say, buddy. Let's set the dragon lady aside for a second, what do you think of running with the mercenary team?

W:
You're used to the work. You get to do pretty much whatever you want. And the commander you hate is already dead.

Flamebringer:
You can't be trusted. Both of us have so much to hide.

Flamebringer:
...Heh. I know a better place. One much more suited to sharpening my blade than Reunion.

Flamebringer:
I saw it. Not long ago. Where you and that Sarkaz had your little transaction. That battle got my blood pumping.

W:
There's always something.

Flamebringer:
You took him out in the end, but facts are facts. You can't cover this up.

W:
Hmph.

W:
Alright, alright! You win. We made a verbal contract, he'd get rid of the boss, grease the wheels a bit for me.

W:
We're all friends here. Let's not stand on ceremony.

Flamebringer:
But you won't let them go.

W:
I can at least leave the people they want to protect.

W:
We agreed a Rhodes Island rescue team could come help. Me killing him didn't break that deal, did it?

W:
I've got my principles. I don't mind cutting some slack here and there. But when I got a toy right here in my hands? How am I not supposed to play with it?

Flamebringer:
And you let him take down so many of your elite fighters. They're not easily replaced.

W:
Yeah, yeah! I'm still pissed off about that!

W:
Ugh. Here I thought I was gonna get back together with an old friend, catch up, make nice. But you're impossible! I'm positively heartbroken!

Reunion Blademaster:
...W, we need to get moving. Dragging this out too long will throw everything off schedule.

W:
Fine. Looks like we're out of time here... You're really not gonna change your mind?

Flamebringer:
Of course not.

W:
Last question: who are you working for now? Oh, there's no way you're gonna answer that,  is there?

W:
And I think I can guess anyway.

Flamebringer:
Really? Here I thought they weren't so famous.

W:
I've got a lot of friends in the neighborhood. You know, I've got friends just about everywhere. You're one of 'em.

Flamebringer:
That last bit disproves the first bit.

W:
Nah. What I'm saying is I might have an idea of how your old mercenary team got wiped out.

W:
The honored captain of your swordmasters behind the plot that turned you into the man you are today, may very well be in the place you intend to go?

Flamebringer:
Is that right...?

Flamebringer:
Is it...

Flamebringer:
Fascinating.

W:
Ahahaha! So you didn't even know! I mean, I only just found out myself.

W:
You'll figure it out soon enough. Things aren't as simple as you think.

W:
I'm really looking forward to seeing what you do. Hehe. What ever will you do?

Reunion Caster:
W! What are you waiting for?!

Flamebringer:
......

W:
Okay, listen, my Sarkaz aren't going to do anything? Whatever needs doing, you guys do it yourselves.

W:
Swordmaster——Er, Flamebringer, you might die in this battle we're about to have.

Flamebringer:
It's been a long time since I've been in a position like this. I'm excited.

W:
Long time? Maybe getting your whole team wiped out didn't turn you as icy cold as they say. Looks like you're all cheered up?

Flamebringer:
That's one way we're different, W. Happiness isn't a goal worth chasing.

Flamebringer:
I lost so much 'last time,' but now the path before me is crystal clear.

Flamebringer:
This time, I hope you won't disappoint me.

W:
Look at that big smile.

W:
If I said I'd let you live, would you believe me?

Flamebringer:
Funny, I was going to ask you the same question.

Dobermann:
According to the contract, there is no requirement that you engage in open hostilities with Reunion prior to your onboarding.

Flamebringer:
At my request.

Dobermann:
We welcome Infected and those ambitious enough to pursue solutions to the Oripathy crisis, but we reject those who violate rules and regulations.

Dobermann:
Considering our lack of information surrounding the specific circumstances of that incident, it has not factored into our decision.

Dobermann:
But this will not happen again.

Flamebringer:
Should anything happen, we can deal with it your way.

Dobermann:
We have already dealt with it. Your goals and motivations have also not factored into our decision.

Dobermann:
If we determine you are inadmissable into Rhodes Island, then no matter how upstanding you may be, we cannot make an exception.

Flamebringer:
Right. It's just a personal request.

Dobermann:
Hmph. No matter. Welcome aboard.

Dobermann:
Listen, your actions from here on reflect on the operators beside you, and they will be making decisions based on your actions.

Dobermann:
As long as you abide by our regulations, Rhodes Island welcomes you as one of our own, regardless of your past.

Dobermann:
Conversely, Operator Flamebringer, should you step even one pinky toe out of line...

Flamebringer:
Right.

Dobermann:
Now then, let's go to Medical. There's someone who'd like to see you.

Flamebringer:
......

Flamebringer:
You...

Flamebringer:
...Heh.

Flamebringer:
So that's how it is.

Flamebringer:
I never should've doubted you, W...

Flamebringer:
Turns out living a bit longer does have its perks.
