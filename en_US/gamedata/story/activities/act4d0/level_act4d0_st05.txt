Everything was white.

From the sky above my head to the ground beneath my feet, everything I could see was a calming white.

Pure, silent, empty white.

Only the flames flickered and swayed.

Eventually, my dream quietly eroded, melting away until finally I awakened.

'Where am I?'

No answer.

'Why am I here?'

No answer.

'Should I leave?'

No answer.

“......”

There was no one but me.

There was nothing but me.

And so,

My confusion left only one——

'What... are you?'

......

02:35 P.M. \ Rainy and Overcast

Rhodes Island Ark - Cabin #2 - Operator Quarters

Ifrit:
!!

Ifrit:
...Phew.

Ifrit:
(Again. Why is it always that same dream. What the hell does it mean?)

Ifrit:
(Ugh. I slept on my head wrong. It's throbbing.)

Ifrit:
(Scratching) This is all this damned Doctor's fault. These questions are too hard!

Ifrit:
What is this even about? Surface area? Who cares?

Ifrit:
Aaaaaagh!

Ifrit:
Nonononono! Not now! Don't ignite!

Ifrit:
Eeeeep...

Ifrit:
I singed the edge of the desk... Okay, at least I didn't burn the worksheet.

Ifrit:
This Doctor...

Ifrit:
Ugh, do I really have to do this whole thing? Pain in the ass...

Ifrit:
Huh? Studying is good for me?

Ifrit:
Come on. Like I didn't know that. Why else would anybody study with you?

Ifrit:
But this is too much homework! And like, what's the difference between this word and this word?

Ifrit:
I say two words to you and Silence takes away my dried peppers. It's all your fault!

Ifrit:
Hey, what are you laughing at?!

Ifrit:
Really?! Where?!

Ifrit:
I want to take them with you. Then she'll lecture both of us.

Ifrit:
Stop silently smiling like that, it's really creepy!

Ifrit:
You just don't want to answer me?

Ifrit:
Ew, Doctor, what is that?

Ifrit:
No, no! I don't want it! ——mmm?

Ifrit:
Hm?

Ifrit:
(Chewing) Mm.

Ifrit:
(Swallowing) Gulp... ah?

Ifrit:
Wh- what did I just eat?

Ifrit:
Never mind...

Ifrit:
Hey, Doctor, is Silence going out on a mission tomorrow?

Ifrit:
You think I could go too? You know how powerful I am, don't you?

Ifrit:
Just talk to her for me. See if you can get her to let me go.

Ifrit:
What are you talking about? I can handle that stuff.

Ifrit:
So why aren't we fighting right now? Send me out already. I want to show everyone my power!

Ifrit:
I can glass a whole battlefield with my flames. They're just jealous they can't!

Ifrit:
I don't care what they say!

Ifrit:
You and Silence believe in me, don't you?

Ifrit:
The others don't understand. I don't care about them, and they don't care about me.

Ifrit:
But why! Tell me why!

Ifrit:
Gah!

Ifrit:
I hate you.

Ifrit:
Forget it. Screw you. Here. This one, and this one, all of these... they're all C.

Ifrit:
And this one... I don't really get. Doesn't matter. It's C too.

Ifrit:
There. Done...!

Medic Operator:
It's time for your checkup, Ifrit.

Ifrit:
Ugh.

Ifrit:
Another annoying doctor's here.

Medic Operator:
Why do I smell burning...?

Medic Operator:
Ifrit? Work with me.

Medic Operator:
We're checking the density of Originium crystals in your blood today. Are you going to cooperate... Hm? What happened to the desk here? How did it get charred?

Ifrit:
Don't worry about it. It was an accident.

Medic Operator:
Ifrit... you know this is dangerous.

Medic Operator:
You can't be starting fires inside Rhodes Island. You have to control yourself.

Medic Operator:
I told them we can't use any suppression drugs, but you have to work with us...

Ifrit:
......

Ifrit:
Are you finished? You sure love to hear yourself talk!

Medic Operator:
...Ifrit, I'm a nurse. I'm really not good with kids.

Medic Operator:
So do you think we could just, you know, communicate?

Ifrit:
Who's a kid?! Do you ever, like, think?!

Ifrit:
Why do I have to deal with people like you all day?! Why can't everyone just leave me alone?!

Medic Operator:
Ifrit... I'm just doing my job.

Ifrit:
Then do it somewhere else! I feel sick to my stomach whenever I see those dumbasses in their stupid white coats!

Ifrit:
Out of my way. I'm leaving.

Medic Operator:
But, your checkup...

Ifrit:
I'll make you move!

Ifrit:
Aaah!!

Ifrit:
My- my homework! It- it burned!

Ifrit:
What did you do?! You did this!

Medic Operator:
Ifrit! Hurry! The flames!

Ifrit:
I told you to leave me alone!!

Ifrit:
You have to pay for this!

Medic Operator:
W- wait! I'll get Nightingale. Just hold on!

Ifrit:
...Why.

Ifrit:
What did I do this time? Damn it...

Ifrit:
My homework!

Ifrit:
It's... ruined.

Ifrit:
(Silence won't take me either. Even though I'm this powerful!)

Ifrit:
(The Doctor's gone too. It's just me and those sickos in the white coats...)

Ifrit:
(It sucks. They're so scared of me they run off as far as they can.)

Ifrit:
(My notebook... is a little singed, but it's still good.)

Ifrit:
(Whatever. I'll just put the practice questions on the Doctor's desk. Good to go, right?)

Frostleaf:
?

Frostleaf:
......

Frostleaf:
Can I help you?

Projekt Red:
!

Frostleaf:
You'll scare people acting like that.

Projekt Red:
I'm just walking.

Frostleaf:
Normal people don't walk on the walls.

Projekt Red:
?

Frostleaf:
Forget it.

Frostleaf:
What's that in your hand there...

Projekt Red:
Homework.

Projekt Red:
It's a pain. But Kal'tsit said to listen to the Doctor. I had no choice.

Projekt Red:
You understand this? This word, I do not know.

Frostleaf:
You're... you're asking me.

Projekt Red:
You don't know?

Frostleaf:
I can try. Let me see.

Frostleaf:
This word... Hm... I'm not sure either.

Frostleaf:
...I think it's like this.

Frostleaf:
Do you understand now? I'm afraid I didn't speak clearly.

Projekt Red:
Yes. Very clear.

Frostleaf:
I'm glad.

Frostleaf:
But you could have asked the Doctor too. The Doctor would have explained it better than me.

Projekt Red:
Yes. But I think Frostleaf speaks softly.

Frostleaf:
...I see.

???:
What are you two doing hanging out in the hallway!

Ifrit:
Hey, Little Red Riding Hood, right? How come I never see you in class...?

Projekt Red:
——Ifrit.

Frostleaf:
Ifrit, don't get so close to her.

Frostleaf:
Red has very quick defensive reflexes. She might lash out at you accidentally.

Projekt Red:
Defensive reflexes?

Frostleaf:
What happens to things that get within five centimeters of you?

Projekt Red:
I cut them.

Frostleaf:
See.

Ifrit:
Huh... You seem to know a lot about her, Ice Cube.

Frostleaf:
I've gone over the operator's handbook and spoken to Dobermann.

Frostleaf:
But do you think maybe you could relax a bit around us, Red?

Projekt Red:
?

Frostleaf:
Never mind...

Ifrit:
Pff.. hahaha!

Projekt Red:
What's funny?

Ifrit:
Hah?

Frostleaf:
Don't worry about it, Red.

Ifrit:
Ugh.

Frostleaf:
Hmm...? What's that you're hiding behind your back?

Ifrit:
Oh? This? It's- it's my homework.

Ifrit:
The mighty Ifrit conquered it easily.

Frostleaf:
Oh...? I'm glad.

Projekt Red:
I smell burning.

Projekt Red:
Ifrit burned her homework.

Ifrit:
......

Ifrit:
I didn't do it on purpose.

Projekt Red:
Oh.

Ifrit:
...You think I burned my homework so I didn't have to finish it, don't you?

Projekt Red:
I don't know.

Ifrit:
Just come out and say it already.

Projekt Red:
?

Frostleaf:
Don't, Ifrit. She doesn't talk much...

Projekt Red:
Are you mad?

Ifrit:
......

Ifrit:
I hate you! You're the worst. Why do we have to be in the same class?

Ifrit:
Why does today suuuck so muuch...? Why does this keep happening to meee?

Frostleaf:
Calm down, Ifrit.

Frostleaf:
The temperature is rising. This is getting dangerous.

Ifrit:
...huh?

Ifrit:
Don't act like you know me. I'm fine! Don't talk to me like you know everything!

Projekt Red:
A threat?

Frostleaf:
No, Red, it's okay! That's just how she is!

Monster.

Ifrit:
Gah.

Projekt Red:
Got it.

Ifrit:
What do you get...?

Monster.

A monster that hurts people. A monster that burns things. A monster who can't control herself.

Ifrit:
It... It hurts... Agh...

Monster.

Projekt Red:
Need to burn?

Frostleaf:
Wait, Ifrit... not here.

Ifrit:
Mind your own business!

Monster.

Ifrit:
You don't know me!

Monster.

Frostleaf:
Stop!

Projekt Red:
She's a threat to me. A threat to Rhodes Island.

Frostleaf:
Don't do it, Red! She's just heating up!

Frostleaf:
Both of you——

Ifrit:
Who's heating up? Are you calling me a hothead?! I'm thinking clearly! It's you and your whole ice queen thing nobody wants! Get the hell away from me or I'll turn you to cinders!

No. Don't.

Projekt Red:
She's out of control. So weak.

Ifrit:
You're kindling, Hood!

Monster.

No, don't do it. They're friends.

Frostleaf:
Don't! Ifrit!

Monster!

I'm not! I'm not a monster!

The flames ignite.

The flames are out of control.

The giant monster cackles.

The white room burns to a charred black.

Some cry. Some flee.

Where am I?

Someone is coming. Someone familiar. Tall...

Ifrit:
No...

Ifrit:
Sari... save... them...

???:
Oh dear, oh my, what is going on here?

???:
Iffy? You can't be igniting in the corridors. Saria would be very upset if she knew. Silence too.

???:
Get...!

Ifrit:
No, it's not... you're not...

???:
Let's gather up some water molecules and calm those flames down...

Ifrit:
?!

Ifrit:
Pfah——It's freezing cold!

Ifrit:
Wha... MuMu?!

Ifrit:
MuMu, help me... I don't want to...

???:
Shhh——You can't tell anyone I'm here.

???:
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

???:
Hehe, I'm not worried at all. You're going to be fine.

???:
But remember what we agreed, Iffy?

Cruel.

Wanton.

Rampage.

Destroyed everything.

......

I know it's all true.

The painful experiments make me sick.

The stares of the people in the white coats make me sick.

This place makes me sick.

This is no life.

This is no future.

All it would take is one flame, one lick hot enough, and all their disgusting eyes, all those white walls stinking of disinfectant, all of it would go up in smoke.

As long as the people I like survive.

The rest mean nothing.

——That's how I used to think. Before I came here.

I think that's how I always thought.

But I'm different now.

Cruel.

I know I know.

Wanton.

Okay, fine, I'll be careful.

Rampage.

...it really wasn't that bad!

Destroyed everything.

I didn't mean to!

It's not like I don't know.

But at least, hrm...

Like you said. I can do it.

I won't burn Rhodes Island, or my homework.

Or my friends. Hrmm... my friends are all as great as me anyway!

So, it's fine. I get it. I haven't been trying hard enough. I have to try even harder.

Just watch me. I'll show all of you!

Ifrit:
Hmph!

Ifrit:
N- no! Agh! It's none of your business!

Ifrit:
Grr... That Little Red Riding hood and, everyone else, they're okay...?

Ifrit:
You helped Hood get away? Hmph, good.

Ifrit:
I'm dangerous? Everyone's dangerous? Oh...

Ifrit:
Let me have one... N- no! I don't want to eat it!

Ifrit:
I can't... eat that much.

Ifrit:
That whole, thing, back in the hallway, I didn't do it on purpose... So, I guess, I'm- I'm sorry!

Ifrit:
Gross, why are you looking at me like that...?

Ifrit:
Oh, hey, don't you need to check my homework? Here it is!

Ifrit:
Gah, don't take it if you don't like it!

Ifrit:
You can make it out, can't you?

Ifrit:
Here. This is the homework.

Ifrit:
There was a little accident and it got like this... Hey, what's with that look? Just come out and say it!

Ifrit:
It is what it is! Who cares if you don't believe me. I did the whole thing. I really did!

Ifrit:
It's- it just got a little... ripped... and singed... and splashed.

Ifrit:
And um erm, some of them I just kind of guessed, but... I'll do better next time!

Ifrit:
......

Ifrit:
I screwed up again.

Ifrit:
Just lay into me already. I can take it.

Ifrit:
Huh? Why?

Ifrit:
Ow! Not so rough!

Ifrit:
Hm?

Ifrit:
It's my... dried peppers? My favorite dried peppers!

Ifrit:
You, uh? I can have them?

Ifrit:
Hey... what the hell! You prick! Don't think you can just give me a little snack and then... and then...

Ifrit:
(Sniffle)

Ifrit:
Hah. Fine then. But I still think you white coat dumbasses are hella gross!

Ifrit:
(Whisper) But I guess you can be an exception!

Ifrit:
But I'm warning you! Don't treat me like a kid all time, like Silence does!

Ifrit:
I'll get angry! And you wouldn't like me when I'm angry!

Ifrit:
Gr... Grr... where did that come from all of a sudden?! It's obvious anyway!

Ifrit:
Gah——Cough cough cough.

Ifrit:
And who taught you that nickname anyw—— No, who—— who said you could call me that!

Ifrit:
!!

Ifrit:
Really? Really really?

Ifrit:
You mean it? I can go out on the next mission? You really mean it? No kidding?

Ifrit:
But what?

Ifrit:
Open your damned mouth!

Ifrit:
You want me to think it through myself? What's that supposed to mean...?

Ifrit:
......

Ifrit:
Right. I have to go apologize...

Ifrit:
The medic lady, I didn't mean to scare her... And I shouldn't have been so rough with Frostleaf and Hood...

Ifrit:
Hey, Doctor, can you do me a favor? Can you come with me? To apologize?

Ifrit:
I...

Ifrit:
I know I screwed up.

Ifrit:
But they're really the worst! Still... I shouldn't do that to them...

Ifrit:
And I don't want people blaming you for it either.

Ifrit:
Beach? What's that?

Ifrit:
Doesn't matter. I'll go! I wanna go!

Ifrit:
Erm, but, why did you invite me all of a sudden? You're kind of a weirdo, Doctor...

Ifrit:
Ugh. You're always trying to make me do stuff, huh?

Ifrit:
Hmph. Fine! I can do it! I can apologize!

Ifrit:
So we have a deal? No backsies! You have to let me go!

Ifrit:
Hehe. 'Beach!' Yeah, sounds pretty sweet.

Ifrit:
See you tomorrow, Doctor!

Ifrit:
......

Ifrit:
Are you still looking?

Ifrit:
Yeah. I know how they look at me. I know what they think of me.

Ifrit:
But it doesn't bother me. What do I care?

Ifrit:
I'll melt you!

Ifrit:
You know, it's your fault for embarrassing me. That's why I always end up in trouble.

Where would you be without me?

Ifrit:
Hah. You think I'm still afraid of you?

Ifrit:
As much as you hurt me, as much as you hurt everyone...

Ifrit:
Fatass! Moron! Pig! Blimp with horns!

Haha. Good one.

Ifrit:
Look, I'm never going to burn everything again.

Ifrit:
I get it. Some things I can burn. Some things I can't.

There's nothing that can't be burned!

Ifrit:
What? It's my choice!

Ifrit:
If the mighty Ifrit chooses not to burn something, it cannot be burned!

Ifrit:
And whatever gets in my way, I'll burn to the ground.

Ifrit:
But the stuff I can't burn? I won't touch. Not with a single lick!

Then I wait, little thing.

Ifrit:
......

Ifrit:
Sooner or later, that day... will come!
