Countryside - Rhodes Island Chief Engineer's Office

Kal'tsit:
What are you doing this time?

Closure:
Kal'tsit, you think I could see the Doctor for a bit?

Kal'tsit:
Has it been too long since you pranked {@nickname}? Feeling antsy?

Closure:
Oh come on! I'm really a very caring person.

Kal'tsit:
Last time you called yourself a caring person, you set up a facility to broadcast 'Closure's Midnight Video Market' at twelve o'clock for three months straight.

Closure:
But...

Kal'tsit:
We still have no way to turn the volume down.

Closure:
Okay okay, I admit it! I want to go tease the Doctor.

Kal'tsit:
Not to mention {@nickname}'s memory loss. I can't say for sure if the Doctor even knows who you are.

Closure:
Huh? Slept too much and turned stupid, huh? That's sad. I'll have to bring the Doctor some snacks as a little cheer-up gift.

Kal'tsit:
Whatever. Just try not to make a bad impression.

Kal'tsit:
Warfarin went bad enough. Add in the Doctor's misconceptions about vampires and the Kazdel matter will have to be postponed. Indefinitely.

Kal'tsit:
This is an opportunity to rehabilitate yourself in the eyes of the people. Seize it well.

Closure:
Do I really need rehabilitating?

Kal'tsit:
After the time you set the climate control system to 36 degrees, yes.

Closure:
That was a power outage in the machine shop.

Kal'tsit:
We found your fingerprints on the console.

Closure:
It was a power outage in the machine shop!

Kal'tsit:
You hacked the surveillance system and deleted the recording, but the console served as a biological backup. I have thirteen tissue samples from thirteen different instances.

Closure:
I'm sorry it's my bad that envoy is such an arrogant prick I just want to rub his nose in it sorry.

Kal'tsit:
......

Closure:
Anyway, the welcome party. Dr. {@nickname}'s welcome back party. We're not throwing one?

Kal'tsit:
Afraid not. Circumstances such as they are.

Closure:
Hey, why you gotta be like that, Kal'tsit? This is the Doctor we're talking about, the Doctor with amensia. We gotta create an atmosphere of warmth and camaraderie.

Kal'tsit:
Did you always look at the Doctor so?

Closure:
Maybe... I've never been that close to the Doctor. But didn't you just say this is the perfect time to make a good impression?

Kal'tsit:
Closure, let's talk about something else.

Closure:
Hmph. If you're not going, I'll go myself. I don't care what you do.

Closure:
Did I hear we're going to Lungmen? I think that was on the schedule.

Kal'tsit:
Yes.

Closure:
And we can operate freely?

Kal'tsit:
Lungmen has become quite dangerous.

Closure:
Huh? Really? Lungmen? I thought that place was all about law and order.

Kal'tsit:
It's the closest city to Chernobog. That should be pretty self-explanatory.

Closure:
So why are we going?

Kal'tsit:
Because it's the closest city to Chernobog.

Closure:
I think you're hiding something...

Kal'tsit:
No. I said everything there is to be said in the last meeting. Right about the time you were slumped back in your chair, wearing an eye mask, fast asleep.

Closure:
What can I say? Keeping this operation well maintained is tiring work.

Kal'tsit:
I never said I blamed you. Without you, Rhodes Island wouldn't even get off the ground.

Kal'tsit:
But I still want to do away with your suspicions... What is it you called me in for, exactly?

Closure:
What? I can't just call up an old friend?

Kal'tsit:
I'll be in my lab.

Closure:
Hey! Wait! Okay... we have a power outage down two corridors in sector three.

Closure:
Can you come look at the cables with me?

Kal'tsit:
Just send an engineer down there. Is it a problem with the power supply cables?

Closure:
Or the two of us could go look ourselves.

Kal'tsit:
Whenever I ask you for an inspection, you always delegate it to another operator.

Closure:
My sense of responsibility as Chief Engineer of Rhodes Island has suddenly awakened! Let's go!

Closure:
Come on, keep up with me...

Closure:
Huh?

Heavyrain:
......

Closure:
......

Closure:
Huh?!

Kal'tsit:
This is Heavyrain.

Closure:
Oh. Heavyrain?

Heavyrain:
Hello, Miss Closure.

Closure:
What a good little girl! Look, Kal'tsit, look how much more likable she is than you!

Kal'tsit:
Hmph.

Kal'tsit:
Heavyrain, let me see your monitor.

Heavyrain:
This one...? On my left arm here?

Kal'tsit:
Yes. Be careful not to touch the needle.

Heavyrain:
Right...

Kal'tsit:
...Numbers look good. Your hemoglobin is up. You're recovering well.

Heavyrain:
Thank you, Dr. Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
No thanks necessary. Just doing my job. You don't thank people for that.

Kal'tsit:
You know the way back, Heavyrain?

Heavyrain:
I know.

Kal'tsit:
Then you show yourself out. Closure and I have something to take care of.

Heavyrain:
But I'm a guard. If I go, will you be okay, Dr. Kal'tsit?

Kal'tsit:
You may be mistaken, Heavyrain.

Kal'tsit:
I asked you to come with us just to give you a the layout of the ship. You may not come here often in the future.

Kal'tsit:
I don't need protection.

Heavyrain:
Right.

Heavyrain:
Then, excuse me. Goodbye, Miss Closure.

Closure:
Yeah, bye.

Closure:
......

Closure:
Did you hear that, Kal'tsit? She called me 'Miss!' Oh what a good little girl...

Closure:
She really seemed to want to help you out. And you sent her away like that?

Kal'tsit:
Every operator has to find her own place in the world, just like me. Having her waste time with things she's not good at doesn't help anybody.

Closure:
Would it kill you to talk like a human being every once in a while?

Kal'tsit:
Heavyrain was in the Sargon military.

Kal'tsit:
Before she can establish interpersonal relationships, she needs to find a proper position for herself and integrate into Rhodes Island. That requires both support and tolerance, as well as her own self-awareness.

Closure:
Yeah yeah, your lectures make my head hurt.

Closure:
She another one of your strays you brought home?

Closure:
You kind of have a talent for picking up new pets, Kal'tsit.

Closure:
How many are we up to now?

Kal'tsit:
It's one of the steps in the 'Acquisition and Cultivation Procedures for Infected Personnel.'

Closure:
Hold on... Last month, you had a solid 72-hour surgical procedure. Was that her you were operating on?

Kal'tsit:
Indeed.

Closure:
The surgical team went through like eight or nine shifts, but you didn't sleep for three days?

Kal'tsit:
At least she recovered quickly.

Closure:
Tell me, Kal'tsit, do you drug yourself?

Kal'tsit:
I refuse to answer that question.

Closure:
If I don't ask, you'll never say, will you?

Kal'tsit:
What's the point of discussing this?

Closure:
You're too hard on yourself.

Kal'tsit:
I can handle it.

Closure:
Dark!

Closure:
Should we be using backup power?

Kal'tsit:
You can't see?

Closure:
I'm a vampire, of course I can see.

Kal'tsit:
So can I.

Closure:
All right then, on we go.

Closure:
Now I know what I just said, but did I step on something?

Closure:
Augh! Wh- what is this!

Kal'tsit:
Nothing to get all upset about...

Closure:
Is that... a gachapon machine? What's it doing here?!

Closure:
Huh. 'Furry Friends Collection. 12 different furry friends to...' Wow, secret level! Awesome!

Kal'tsit:
Clo-sure!

Closure:
It's been a long time since I worked in a dark pipeline like this. I really missed it.

Closure:
And Rhodes Island wasn't nearly this big back then.

Closure:
Spanner, please!

Closure:
Thanks, Mon3tr!

Closure:
Hm...

Kal'tsit:
What is it?

Closure:
I can't reach it. Can you give me a boost so I can fix the cable?

Kal'tsit:
Okay.

Closure:
Oof... This whole area has been totally cut off from the power supply. We can start troubleshooting.

Closure:
Kal'tsit, do you think it was a mistake to go to Chernobog and rescue the Doctor?

Kal'tsit:
It was certainly unwise to enter Chernobog at that time.

Closure:
So...

Kal'tsit:
Amiya was very firm in her decision. No one could sway her. And you know how the elite operators are.

Closure:
It only happened because you abstained.

Closure:
I'm starting to think this was some kind of test of Amiya?

Kal'tsit:
Test? No, not a test. Or rather if it was a test, it wasn't me administering it. It was the situation she found herself in.

Kal'tsit:
But as firmly as she believed in that decision, I could only support her... Though I certainly didn't have to make her feel like it would all go smoothly.

Kal'tsit:
Her choice is her choice.

Closure:
Well said. But you're the one who has to deal with the consequences. Aren't you tired...?

Kal'tsit:
Nobody gets it all right from beginning to end, Closure. Not even me.

Kal'tsit:
But we made it through the darkness. Now we just wait for the light at the end of the tunnel.

Kal'tsit:
Also, that second cable right above your head is about to fall.

Closure:
Hey hey hey! Hold me steady! If the three-pin power connector drops, that's the end of both of us.

Closure:
Okay, hold up, I'm laying out the wire.

Kal'tsit:
Did you just stuff two whole sets of wires in behind them?

Closure:
Shhh! I must feel the thrum of the electricity in my own heart, to achieve peace and balance with the current.

Kal'tsit:
I advise you to mull over what you just said.

Closure:
But, Kal'tsit... Oh, should be good. Try the switch.

Closure:
I was saying, regardless of what kind of riddle you were just playing at, if you're walking in the dark, you need some kind of light, right?

Kal'tsit:
Aren't we fixing the lights right now?

Closure:
Yeah, there we go.

Kal'tsit:
Closure.

Kal'tsit:
Why are you asking me about these things?

Closure:
Because if I don't ask, you don't tell.

Closure:
You let it all well up inside you until you go crazy.

Kal'tsit:
So my answers don't even matter to you?

Closure:
I think all these things you told me are reeeeeeaaally important, to you.

Closure:
So yeah it's not that important what you say... but it's really super important that you say it, and I hear it with my own two ears.

Kal'tsit:
What a waste of time.

Kal'tsit:
Next time I'll just hand you the written report.

Closure:
But then you wouldn't come with me.

Kal'tsit:
Says who?

Kal'tsit:
As long as you really have some lights that need fixing.

Closure:
Promise?

Kal'tsit:
How is it I always end up making some strange, inexplicable deal with you?

Closure:
That's what an engineer does!

Closure:
Here, Kal'tsit, take a look at this light bulb.

Kal'tsit:
It's very clear?

Closure:
Yeah, clear!

Kal'tsit:
...

Kal'tsit:
If only you were like this all the time, I'd be a lot less tense.

Kal'tsit:
If only...

Closure:
Woah! Shut up! Don't say it!

Closure:
Just be quiet... and enjoy this little light together.

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
It really is a nice, gentle light.
