Reunion Member:
So, you must be Misha?

Misha:
...

Reunion Member:
Hello.

Misha:
...?

Reunion Member:
I've heard a lot about you from Skullshatterer. Now, I finally get to meet you.

Misha:
Are you also... Infected...?

Reunion Member:
Yes, I am.

Misha:
Why did you... join Reunion?

Reunion Member:
Why?

Reunion Member:
...

Reunion Member:
My wife, my child... they were all killed by the Chernobogians.

Reunion Member:
Under Ursus, the Infected were treated worse than lifestock.

Reunion Member:
The destruction of Chernobog...? No, no. That is far too light of a punishment...

Reunion Member:
Do you know how much blood is on their hands?!

Reunion Member:
Misha... We've been feared, exploited, humiliated, and persecuted...

Reunion Member:
...Just because of the fact that we're Infected.

Reunion Member:
Not for any other reason.

Misha:
...

Reunion Member:
S-sorry, I got a bit heated. Forget what I said.

Misha:
...

Skullshatterer:
Ivan, come help tend to the injured.

Reunion Member:
Coming.

Skullshatterer:
We're only using this abandoned mine as a temporary base until we can reorganize and regroup.

Skullshatterer:
Once the time is right, we'll make our way back to Chernobog.

Misha:
...

Misha:
...Al--

Skullshatterer:
No...

Skullshatterer:
I threw away that name long ago.

Misha:
Why...?

Skullshatterer:
That person already died.

Skullshatterer:
Just call me Skullshatterer.

Skullshatterer:
Are you... afraid?

Misha:
Skull...shatterer? ...Why?

Skullshatterer:
Ah... You'll soon understand.

Skullshatterer:
After we learned that you ended up as a refugee in Lungmen, everyone volunteered to go rescue you.

Skullshatterer:
We've also accepted many new members there.

Misha:
But... you're hurting people.

Misha:
I don't want to... do that...

Misha:
Why are the Infected fighting each other...

Skullshatterer:
An eye for an eye, as things should be.

Skullshatterer:
There is a saying in Ursus. 'Welcome your kin as you would welcome the warm spring...'

Skullshatterer:
'But welcome your enemies...'

Skullshatterer:
... ... ...

Misha:
What's wrong?

Skullshatterer:
...Do you know?

Skullshatterer:
No... No, you don't.

Skullshatterer:
When they came for me, they dragged me out of my house...

Misha:
What's wrong?

Skullshatterer:
I saw my mother. She grabbed my hand...

Skullshatterer:
You saw it too.

Misha:
...No...

Skullshatterer:
You must have--

Skullshatterer:
They beat her mercilessly, but she wouldn't let go of me...

Skullshatterer:
She left a trail of blood in the snow as they dragged her away.

Skullshatterer:
If Reunion had... If the Infected could have... If only--!

Skullshatterer:
If they came sooner, none of this would have happened!

Skullshatterer:
We would not have had to suffer so much!

Misha:
I... I wasn't brave enough to...

Misha:
I... Aaaahh...

Skullshatterer:
Misha...

Skullshatterer:
It'll be fine... It'll all be fine in the end.

Skullshatterer:
I don't blame you.

Skullshatterer:
Back then... who would've been brave enough?

Skullshatterer:
But now, Reunion has given me that bravery.

Misha:
Al--

Misha:
Skullshatterer...

Skullshatterer:
Whether or not you trust us is up to you.

Skullshatterer:
Even if you trust us, whether or not you join us is also up to you.

Skullshatterer:
But you are an Infected.

Skullshatterer:
Reunion... will definitely fight until the bitter end so that the Infected can be free.

Misha:
But... you destroyed Chernobog.

Misha:
Along with countless innocents--

Skullshatterer:
...Innocents?

Skullshatterer:
Hah. Who's innocent?

Skullshatterer:
When Chernobog implemented the quarantine, did any of them speak out against it?

Skullshatterer:
When Ursus sent us to die in the mines and the frozen wastelands, did any of them do anything about it?

Skullshatterer:
Did any of them ever stand up for us?!

Misha:
I don't know...

Skullshatterer:
...Reunion has two leaders who fought for Ursus for a long time.

Skullshatterer:
They said that there were some in Ursus who stood against the government for the sake of the Infected.

Skullshatterer:
But they weren't in Chernobog.

Skullshatterer:
Chernobog coldly turned a blind eye towards us as we died...

Skullshatterer:
No, they laughed as they watched us die!!

Misha:
...

Skullshatterer:
Chernobog... deserved to be destroyed!

Misha:
I met other people who were helping the Infected... They...

Skullshatterer:
Rhodes Island?

Skullshatterer:
Despite being Infected, they helped Lungmen and harmed us, didn't they?

Misha:
...

Skullshatterer:
They slew our comrades and decimated our brethren, didn't they?

Misha:
No...

Skullshatterer:
You couldn't see the truth. But it should be clear to you now...

Skullshatterer:
...

Skullshatterer:
...Sorry, I let my anger take over.

Misha:
It's fine... I...

Misha:
I understand how you feel...

Misha:
You must have been suffering so much... all this time...

Skullshatterer:
Everyone has been through a lot.

Skullshatterer:
But right now, at least we have hope.

Skullshatterer:
Talulah... She is the one who took charge of the Infected and led the fight against the cruelty of this world.

Skullshatterer:
Reunion is the only hope we have.

Misha:
I see... You've all suffered so much...

Misha:
If Reunion can really protect them all...

Skullshatterer:
Of course.

Skullshatterer:
Just like how Reunion will protect everyone... I will protect you.

Skullshatterer:
I won't let anyone hurt you anymore.

Misha:
Skullshatterer...

Exusiai:
Ooh, I found 'em--!

Exusiai:
Looks like they sustained some pretty serious losses.

Exusiai:
Luckily, I didn't head back to the company headquarters... Otherwise, I would've needed to make a long detour for this mission...

Texas:
Try to predict their escape routes.

Texas:
Send all likely routes along with their bearings to Amiya.

Exusiai:
I'll be done in a sec!

Texas:
Hmph.

Texas:
We can't give Reunion time to regroup.

Exusiai:
Hmmm, let's see... over here... like this... and that should do it!

Texas:
Are you done, Exusiai?

Exusiai:
What do you need? How are we going to do this?

Texas:
Let's have a little warm-up first.

Texas:
Start with their sentries.
