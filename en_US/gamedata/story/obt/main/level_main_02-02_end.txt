Ch'en:
... And that concludes my report of Rhodes Island's combat operations.

Wei Yenwu:
And your assessment?

Ch'en:
There is little reason to doubt their strength.

Ch'en:
However, Chief Wei, given their identities, I believe that from a strategic standpoint...

Ch'en:
... the L.G.D. is more than capable of handling the job.

Wei Yenwu:
When it comes to fighting crime and prevent infiltration, the L.G.D. is more than sufficient.

Wei Yenwu:
Rhodes Island may be able to bring more to the table. However...

Wei Yenwu:
Of the things that Rhodes Island has requested, there is one 'item' that we are unwilling to exchange based upon what has been offered.

Wei Yenwu:
The temporary defense cooperation that you're providing is far from equal value. As things stand, your 'asking price' is a bit too high.

Wei Yenwu:
Miss Kal'tsit, Miss Amiya, I hope you two both understand.

Kal'tsit:
Mister Wei, a temporary defense will not be enough. There are a lot of things about Reunion that you don't know about.

Kal'tsit:
Based upon the data we gathered while fighting them, if no proactive measures are taken, Reunion will seize control of Lungmen within two weeks.

Ch'en:
... Nonsense. There's no evidence of that--

Kal'tsit:
Madam Ch'en, would you like to know the real reason Chernobog fell within one night?

Ch'en:
...

Wei Yenwu:
Please elaborate.

Kal'tsit:
Amiya.

Amiya:
Ah... Sure.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island wasn't just involved in the Chernobog incident... We also were caught inside the Catastrophe, and survived.

Wei Yenwu:
Impressive, impressive.

Wei Yenwu:
It's not every day I meet someone crazy enough to have made it out of a Catastrophe alive. Miss Amiya, please continue, I'm listening.

Amiya:
... We fought against Reunion's leader.

Ch'en:
...

Wei Yenwu:
Hmm? What's her name again?

Wei Yenwu:
I don't recall clearly...

Wei Yenwu:
Ah, right, Talulah.

Wei Yenwu:
Madam Ch'en, what do you think?

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
I... I know.

Amiya:
... This is what happened to Rhodes Island at Chernobog. Even though Reunion managed to wrest control of Chernobog from Ursus...

Amiya:
But in order to expand, they'll have to deal with their resource shortages. Lungmen will be their next stepping stone.

Amiya:
Even though you might be able to fend them off for a while, their attacks will not cease unless you handle this situation proactively.

Amiya:
Furthermore... There's another unknown factor - we still don't know how Ursus will respond after losing Chernobog...

Wei Yenwu:
Hahaha... Well spoken, young lady.

Wei Yenwu:
Due to the seriousness of this threat and the L.G.D.'s limited manpower, I'm not opposed to considering this temporary agreement based on the terms that were detailed earlier.

Wei Yenwu:
But what I said before still holds...

Kal'tsit:
...

Kal'tsit:
... Rhodes Island's asking price is still too high?

Wei Yenwu:
Correct.

Wei Yenwu:
In order to make sure Lungmen is properly compensated, I have two very simple conditions.

Wei Yenwu:
First, Rhodes Island will help the L.G.D. suppress the Reunion threat. This includes identifying threats within Lungmen as well as those related to fallout from Chernobog.

Wei Yenwu:
This also includes assessing the degree that the Infected have infiltrated Lungmen. I expect that you will share any potentially helpful information with us.

Kal'tsit:
What's the second condition, then?

Wei Yenwu:
I will tell you about the second condition after you've satisfied the first.

Wei Yenwu:
Naturally, I won't ask for anything outside of Rhodes Island's area of expertise.

Kal'tsit:
I'm not sure I understand. Could you please elaborate, Mister Wei?

Wei Yenwu:
How should I put this... If Reunion causes damage that surpasses Rhodes Island's estimates...

Wei Yenwu:
I hope that you will help the L.G.D. handle the situation, which may include post-disaster management. Of course, nothing beyond your capabilities. That's roughly the gist of it.

Kal'tsit:
...

Wei Yenwu:
I cannot say much more at this point. However, don't forget, Rhodes Island doesn't have a choice.

Wei Yenwu:
If you can't accept our terms, then all the conditions we discussed, as well as your requests, will be...

Kal'tsit:
Amiya?

Amiya:
Dr. Kal'tsit...

Amiya:
Mister Wei, I would like to add one more clause to the agreement...

Amiya:
'Any interpretation of the clauses must be agreed upon by both parties.' Is this acceptable?

Wei Yenwu:
Oh... Of course. I can see your respect to Lungmen, Miss Amiya.

Wei Yenwu:
Madam Ch'en, do you have any objections?

Ch'en:
... I accept this operation.

Wei Yenwu:
Hah.

Wei Yenwu:
It seems like Madam Ch'en also has her own goal now.

Ch'en:
...

Wei Yenwu:
In any case, congratulations. You've earned Lungmen's trust. Madam Ch'en will be responsible for your arrangements.

Wei Yenwu:
However, be aware that the Infected are not allowed to freely move around within the city, as that may cause panic.

Wei Yenwu:
I hope that you will defer to the L.G.D.'s orders while carrying out your duties.

Wei Yenwu:
Especially, Madam Ch'en's orders.

Wei Yenwu:
Lungmen will be open to Rhodes Island, as long as your actions are in line with us.

Amiya:
Phew... Ugh...! That man was so difficult...

Amiya:
He was so methodical when he spoke, and it felt like he couldn't be swayed by anything...

Kal'tsit:
Amiya, you'll eventually have to learn how to deal with these people yourself.

Kal'tsit:
But in the end, you did a great job.

Amiya:
Ehehe...

Kal'tsit:
By the way...

Kal'tsit:
...

Kal'tsit:
You...

Kal'tsit:
... ...

Amiya:
Dr. Kal'tsit, please don't give Dr. {@nickname} a hard time...

Kal'tsit:
*inhales sharply*...

Amiya:
...

Kal'tsit:
Haah...

Kal'tsit:
I hope our sacrifices... weren't in vain.

Kal'tsit:
Hello, Dr. {@nickname}.

Kal'tsit:
Welcome back.
