Yeti Squad Member A:
*Pant* *pant*... Impressive!

Yeti Squad Member B:
The black raincoats are retreating! Run while you can!

Reunion Member:
Thanks!

Yeti Squad Member B:
Don't thank us. If you have the strength, you should fight alongside us!

Yeti Squad Member A:
Did you see him swing down from the fourth floor and graze my head like that? If I didn't freeze his weapon with the Originium FrostNova left in my backpack, I wouldn't be standing here!

Yeti Squad Member A:
Very impressive. They're just like the swordsmen in the gas masks back in Ursus. Even stronger, really!

Yeti Squad Member B:
You almost died, what are you so excited about? The masked swordsmen you're talking about were the Ursus Royal Guard! We only met five of them that time!

Yeti Squad Member B:
Did you count how many raincoats there are?

Yeti Squad Member A:
Does that mean we're even more awesome than before?

Yeti Squad Member B:
This is not a time for jokes. Their techniques and their equipment mean they must have a city... Even the craftsmen of multiple cities supplying them.

Yeti Squad Member B:
There's no way we can beat them back on our own. Don't even think about trying to kill them!

Yeti Squad Member A:
I just... I just think I did pretty well.

Yeti Squad Member B:
The point is this situation is way beyond what we can handle... We can't hold out for long!

Yeti Squad Member C:
Quiet!

Phantom Crossbowman:
Reporting in.

Yeti Squad Member C:
Sister, these are... Faust's people.

FrostNova:
*Cough* *cough*... I recognize them.

Phantom Crossbowman:
FrostNova, we received your message, and...

FrostNova:
Why is Mephisto with you? What happened to him?

Phantom Crossbowman:
Mephisto has taken some... hits to his psyche.

FrostNova:
Him? Traumatized?

FrostNova:
Wait, where is Faust?

Phantom Crossbowman:
Faust stayed behind to give us, and others, a chance to escape. We left him outside the slums.

FrostNova:
......

FrostNova:
It's hard to come back from that.

FrostNova:
Faust was a brave warrior.

Phantom Crossbowman:
FrostNova, if we could, we would like to fight alongside the Yetis.

FrostNova:
You could. We must get our remaining people out safely.

FrostNova:
Find a sniping position and await orders. We will need your support in the coming battle. We don't know when the enemy may attack again.

Phantom Crossbowman:
Understood!

FrostNova:
Pass our location to all teams: We will guarantee a safe route for their retreat from here!

FrostNova:
Keep evacuating.

Yeti Squad Member C:
Understood!

Reunion Member:
Are they like the Ursus soldiers with a total disregard for collateral damage?

Yeti Squad Member:
I don't think so. The Ursus were willing to use direct artillery fire on the upper city!

Reunion Member:
I knew they were brutal. But that brutal?

Yeti Squad Member:
We saw it with our own eyes.

Yeti Squad Member:
The raincoat people are very different.

Yeti Squad Member:
They see civilians as targets, since they can't tell the difference between Infected and uninfected. They don't know if maybe we're dressing up as civilians.

Yeti Squad Member:
The Ursus just didn't care, but these people don't let a single one slip through.

Reunion Member:
There are so many fleeing, it's damn near impossible to keep order! FrostNova is in a tough spot!

Yeti Squad Member:
Sister won't let anyone die. Reunion or no.

Yeti Squad Member:
We came to Lungmen to fight. How did we end up saving people? It's funny.

Reunion Member:
The fighting is pretty much done. If you guys didn't show up, we'd all be dead!

Yeti Squad Member:
Man that's crazy. You're really counting on us?

Reunion Member:
Can you not talk like that...? I used to think you guys were so imposing, but now you just seem like a bunch of clowns.

Yeti Squad Member:
You got us all wrong. We just don't talk much. Shouldn't be imposing.

Reunion Member:
Anyway, aren't we supposed to be holding this place with you?

Yeti Squad Member:
You're totally right! Bro, let's defend this place together!

FrostNova:
What's going on?

Yeti Squad Member:
We... we found some locals locked up in here.

Yeti Squad Member:
A mother and daughter. We were going to use the place as a firing position, but we don't know how to communicate with them... They seem pretty scared of us.

FrostNova:
......

Lungmenite:
(Local language)!

Lungmenite:
(Local language) ...... (local language) ......!

FrostNova:
She is your child, yes?

Child:
Waaahhh!

FrostNova:
Such a healthy one.

FrostNova:
Don't be afraid. Don't cry. Your mama is right here.

FrostNova:
Mama is here.

Child:
Waaahhh...

Child:
Mm... Um... Mm.

Child:
Hehe.

Yeti Squad Member:
Oh, the child is smiling...

FrostNova:
Get her out of here.

Lungmenite:
...... (Local language)?

FrostNova:
You *cough* escort her. See her to safety.

Yeti Squad Member:
They're uninfected. There are so many of our people who need evacuating. We don't have time.

FrostNova:
Oh?

Yeti Squad Member:
...Right. Who cares whether it's the Infected or the uninfected now? Understood.

Yeti Squad Member:
Erm, uh, ma'am, um... Komm zis way?

Lungmenite:
Neidei, neidei... hou.

Yeti Squad Member:
FrostNova, Sister, wait for us to come back. Don't try to hold on your own.

FrostNova:
Have some faith in your big sister.

FrostNova:
Hurry! They're coming!

FrostNova:
They are deploying some units wearing other uniforms... They might be Lungmen's L. G. D.!

FrostNova:
*Cough* *cough* ... *hack*.

FrostNova:
Go!

Yeti Squad Member A:
The temperature is as low as it will go!

Yeti Squad Member B:
The uniformed ones are no match for us, but watch out for the raincoats!

Yeti Squad Member C:
Where's Nesti? We need more firepower. We need suppressing fire!

Yeti Squad Member A:
He says okay!

Yeti Squad Member A:
I don't think Sister's body can take much more. She can't keep the temperature down!

Yeti Squad Member B:
We can't break the pavement?

Yeti Squad Member C:
No way! If we do that, how will our people and the locals get to the exit?

Yeti Squad Member B:
We're sure this is the only way out?

Yeti Squad Member C:
Yes. The other ones have all been destroyed. All that's left is the one we dug.

Yeti Squad Member A:
How much time do we have? Or how much time does Sister have?

Yeti Squad Member A:
Why must it come down to tormenting her so?

Yeti Squad Member A:
They're almost done!

Yeti Squad Member C:
I'll go get Sister!

Yeti Squad Member C:
Sister, we've just about got this group evacuated!

FrostNova:
And the fighting... how goes?

Yeti Squad Member C:
We've got the L. G. D. completely suppressed. The terrain favors us, and they can't make use of their superior numbers.

Yeti Squad Member C:
But...

FrostNova:
You have nothing to hide.

Yeti Squad Member C:
Lungmen's raincoat brigade doesn't care about the terrain, or the people. They... they're going to level everything.

Yeti Squad Member C:
They're purging the slums

FrostNova:
And those uninfected Lungmenites we saw...?

Yeti Squad Member C:
I'm afraid that was their doing.

FrostNova:
......

Yeti Squad Member C:
Sister, stop your Arts! We can handle these ones ourselves. Just rest for a bit!

FrostNova:
*Cough* *cough*...

Yeti Squad Member C:
Sister!

Yeti Squad Member A:
The temperature just cracked the lower limit!

Yeti Squad Member A:
She's doing it...! The superstructure is weakening!

Yeti Squad Member A:
Smash their footing and push them back! Fire!

???:
......

Yeti Squad Member B:
They're falling back! Keep it up!

Yeti Squad Member A:
Faster! More! Faster!

Reunion Member:
R- right!

Yeti Squad Member A:
That's our big sister! She really did it!

Yeti Squad Member C:
......

Yeti Squad Member A:
Petrova, what's wrong? Why do you look so gloomy?

Yeti Squad Member A:
...Sister?

Petrova:
Young, come here.

Young:
No.

Petrova:
Come!

Young:
I can't!

Petrova:
You have to. Sister doesn't have much time left.
