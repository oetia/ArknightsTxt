L. G. D. Officer:
Hurry! Get back! The Infected have turned into monsters!

L. G. D. Officer:
Agh! I've been bit! I've been bit!

Herd:
Ung.

Herd:
Aaaahh!

Herd:
(Terrifying screaming).

Blaze:
......

Blaze:
How could this happen...?

Blaze:
What has that nasty little boy done?!

Blaze:
Doctor, we need to move! We have to meet up with Amiya!

Blaze:
A small fire team can't handle a herd of this size. We have to tread carefully!

Blaze:
There's nothing we can do for the L. G. D. now. We're in a much worse position than them.

Blaze:
Set them aside. My top priority is to guarantee your safety.

L. G. D. Officer:
We're being overrun!

L. G. D. Officer:
We're dead if we don't retreat!

???:
Don't panic.

L. G. D. Officer:
Huh?! Who's...?

L. G. D. Officer:
That uniform... You're...

???:
The cavalry is here. Stand firm.

???:
Form two teams and move on their flanks.

L. G. D. Officer:
But, Master...

???:
Trust me. While I cannot take action myself, this method will succeed.

???:
Execute a pincer attack, hold the enemy in place, and leave the stragglers to your reinforcements.

Herd:
Nnng... Ngaaaa!

L. G. D. Officer:
...Thank you, sir!

L. G. D. Officer:
If you hadn't come to help...

???:
......

???:
Behind you.

L. G. D. Officer:
C- counterattack!

???:
It is no use.

???:
Form up. And fall back.

L. G. D. Officer:
Yes, sir!

L. G. D. Officer:
No, if we do that...

L. G. D. Officer:
We can't hold here. We have to find a way out...

L. G. D. Officer:
Of course! The high ground! We move up the stairs and attack down into the corridor!

L. G. D. Officer:
...No. All we can do is hold. But at least we won't get cornered by this crowd of lunatics!

L. G. D. Officer:
Right. Come about, gather up at each doorway, pull back the teams, and take a defensive formation! Hurry! Move!

???:
Well done. I approve.

L. G. D. Officer:
Sir, come with us!

???:
No need.

L. G. D. Officer:
What?

???:
Go.

???:
I will move on the ground.

???:
......

L. G. D. Officer:
We can't hold them!

L. G. D. Officer:
All we have is piercing weapons, and they're useless against these things!

L. G. D. Captain:
Hold your ground!

L. G. D. Captain:
We're the last line of defense for the civilians behind us!

L. G. D. Officer:
Then what do we do?!

L. G. D. Captain:
We fight to the last man!

L. G. D. Captain:
Watch the Originium they're throwing. It corrodes your equipment, and some of them explode!

L. G. D. Officer:
Ah...! They hit Ah Chung!

L. G. D. Captain:
Ah Chung, get back! You, move up! Don't let them through!

Herd:
Guuhhh.

L. G. D. Officer:
Aaaaaagh! Th- they got me! They're eating me! Noo! Aaaaieeeee!!!

L. G. D. Captain:
Ah Yee!!!

???:
How embarrassing!

???:
Zongguan Bailei Zhengfa, loose!

Herd:
Nnng...!!

L. G. D. Captain:
Lightning Arts?!

L. G. D. Captain:
H- how... you wiped them all out in one bright flash?

???:
*Pant...* *pant...*

???:
I just said I would not act. Little did I know how incapable you are of protecting the masses.

???:
That I would be forced to take such action, it's humiliating!

L. G. D. Captain:
Madam Censor...

Censor:
Madam nothing! Were you not told to ignore my presence?

L. G. D. Captain:
...We never thought...

Censor:
I found your spirit laudable. How disappointing it was to see you hopping about aimlessly, leaving me to do your work. Honestly, what were you doing?

Censor:
Now! To your place!

L. G. D. Captain:
But you just said...

Censor:
Chop chop! How have you not learned to move with haste even after witnessing me?

Censor:
Oh, but of course. You did not witness me. I did nothing. Is that clear?

L. G. D. Captain:
Crystal!

Censor:
But if a single hair on the head of a single commoner comes to harm, you are all terminated. Even I must resign. We are all unemployed.

L. G. D. Captain:
Y- yes, of course... We'll fight with all our strength.

Censor:
Very good. Now why are you just standing there? Move!

Censor:
By the way...? Do you know those Black Cloaks?

L. G. D. Captain:
Black Cloak? What's that?

Censor:
Get your eyes checked! Those people on the rooftops, wearing the billowing black cloaks.

L. G. D. Captain:
Apologies, Madam. What are you talking about?

Swire:
Defenders, fan out!

Ch'en:
Recon team, fall back! Hold firing position!

Ch'en:
Are these Infected mutants messing with the radio waves? Our scouts could be in trouble.

Swire:
We can't hold them...! There's so many! Didn't you cut through a whole wave of these things back there? Why haven't you done that already?!

Ch'en:
This is different!

Swire:
Hah. Leave it to this puk gaai Lung to be so useless right when we need her most!

Ch'en:
Then why don't you show us what you can do!

Swire:
Drone!

Ch'en:
Huh.

Swire:
SUPERINTENDENT CH'EN SAYS: RECON TEAM! FALL BACK! HOLD FIRING POSITION!

Swire:
How was that?

Ch'en:
Huh?

Swire:
I said how was that?! Fire team, loose explosive bolts!

Ch'en:
What did you say?!

Swire:
......

Ch'en:
Am I deaf now thanks to you?!

Ch'en:
Go. Use your talents to get the word out to the communications team at Originium Transciever Beta. Have them tell everyone: the herd is tough, hold your positions, minimize casualties, don't conserve firepower.

Swire:
You really are a *Lungmen profanity*!

Ch'en:
I can read your lips!

Swire:
(Mouthing the word 'diu').

L. G. D. Officer:
Sir!

Ch'en:
I can't hear you!

L. G. D. Officer:
SIR!

Herd:
(Din of roaring).

Ch'en:
Speak up!

L. G. D. Officer:
SIR!!!

L. G. D. Defender:
Use the bunker-busters! Hurry!

L. G. D. Officer:
......

Ch'en:
......

Ch'en:
It's quiet.

L. G. D. Officer:
Sir.

Ch'en:
Okay. I can hear you.

L. G. D. Officer:
......

Ch'en:
Go ahead. Speak.

L. G. D. Officer:
We have... guests.

Ch'en:
Already? They took the chance to infiltrate our unit, huh.

Ch'en:
I guess it's to be expected. They were never going to give us free rein.

Ch'en:
Anyway, it doesn't change our plans. Let them see how strong Lungmen is.

L. G. D. Officer:
One more thing. I... I'm not sure how accurate the reports are.

Ch'en:
Out with it.

L. G. D. Officer:
Some units have reported sightings of individuals wearing black raincoats.

Ch'en:
Reunion?

L. G. D. Officer:
Thankfully no. We've seen evidence of them clashing with Reunion. And...

Ch'en:
And what?

L. G. D. Officer:
And... the Reunion they clashed with all seem to have died in, how can I describe it...?

Ch'en:
Sounds like an urban legend. You've got shadowy figures running around Lungmen in black raincoats on a bright, sunny day? Somebody needs help...

Ch'en:
......

Ch'en:
Black raincoats?

GreyThroat:
......

GreyThroat:
What is... that?

???:

???:
Sector 12 cleansed. Purged of Infected.

???:
Teams 3 and 4 operating.

???:
Moving to next sector.

Herd:
Guh... Ugh...

Herd:
(Strange crying).

Reunion Member:
W- why! Why are you hurting your people? Snap out of it!

Reunion Member:
N- no! Run! Hurry!

Reunion Member:
Get out of here! Don't let them get you! Run!

???:
Additional target acquired.

???:
Infected fugitive group on the border of Sectors 13 and 6. 44 individuals.

???:
Completion estimate: within five minutes.

???:

Reunion Member:
Agh! H- help!

Reunion Member:
We surrender! We——

GreyThroat:

GreyThroat:
Um... N- no...
