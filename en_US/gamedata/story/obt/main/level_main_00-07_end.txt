Dobermann:
Based on our planned route, we should be approaching the central town of South Chernobog.

Dobermann:
We'll arrive at the rendezvous point after crossing this park. Assuming no contingencies, Nearl and Team E4 should be waiting for us there.

Guard:
But...

Guard:
If Nearl was attacked... What would we do then?

Guard:
What if they wanted to alert us, but couldn't due to communications being jammed...

Guard:
How should we deal with that?

Dobermann:
...

Amiya:
We will go assess the situation.

Guard:
...Oh...

Ace:
Don't start speculating before seeing things with your own eyes.

Ace:
There's no point of letting paranoia get the better of you.

Guard:

Dobermann:
Losing our communications has caused anxiety to spread through the ranks much faster than I imagined...

Dobermann:
Especially with this looming Catastrophe.

Dobermann:
We have to pick up our pace.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Ugh... What's with this haze...?

Amiya:

Amiya:
It's a trap...!

Reunion Member:

Amiya:
Where's our scout?!

Guard:
They got separated from us!

???:
Rhodes Island...

???:
I've caught you.

Reunion Member:
...!

Reunion Member:
Kill them all! !

???:
This time, I'll grind your bones to dust!

Amiya:
Dobermann!

Dobermann:
Snipers, stop their advance!

Dobermann:
Defenders, hold the line. Get ready to push forward!

Dobermann:
Ace, prepare to--

???:
Time out, time out--

Amiya:
? !

???:
I only just finished purging the Southeast Fortress, but I rushed over here as soon as I heard the news.

???:
These are my hunting grounds, Crownslayer.

Crownslayer:
...

Crownslayer:
What'd you come here for?

???:
Isn't it about time you handed them over to me?
