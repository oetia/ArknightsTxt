Reunion Member:
No...

Reunion Member:
Impossible! Impossible...!

Reunion Member:
H-how could this be?! Skullshatterer, Skullshatterer!

Reunion Member:
W-we can't let Misha see this...

Reunion Member:
Who here knows first aid? Get them over here now!

Reunion Member:
Damn it, why did Mephisto refuse to come? What is he doing?!

Reunion Member:
He kept talking about some 'other plan'... What the hell is with that?!

Reunion Member:
If he was here, we would've been able to save so many people!

W:
We can't count on that guy anyway. He doesn't care about his comrades anyway.

Reunion Member:
...

W:
Don't blame yourself for things you can't control.

Reunion Member:
Thanks for covering us, W...

Reunion Member:
At least, we were able to bring him back.

W:
If you want to thank me, do it through your actions.

Reunion Member:
Of course. We'll cover your escape... However, I have one request--

Reunion Member:
Please promise to take care of Misha.

W:
Of course. After all...

Misha:
I am still of use to you, right?

Reunion Member:
We...

Misha:
Please let me spend some time with Skullshatterer alone.

Misha:
I will... take care of him.

Reunion Member:
But...

Reunion Member:
... ...

Reunion Member:
...Fine.

Reunion Member:
W, it's a promise. One that you must keep.

W:
I know, I know~

Misha:
I just said--

Misha:
Let me spend some time with him alone.

W:
But you should get going.

Misha:
...

W:
Lungmen and Rhodes Island will come barging in here any moment now.

W:
I guess the people here are going to die too.

W:
My, oh my, what a dilemma we have.

W:
Misha, so many more people are going to die because of you...

W:
What a pity.

Misha:
You're really getting on my nerves, W.

Misha:
You won't get anything from me.

W:
Wooahh, scary~

W:
You know, that bunny girl seems to really care about you~

W:
But, that Ch'en lady seems different.

W:
She won't show mercy to anyone.

W:
Maybe she'll decide to spare your life, because she needs you...

W:
But you've seen enough in Ursus to know what will happen after that, right?

Misha:
...

W:
If you come with me now, it's still not too late.

W:
Although... you'd still have to watch all our Reunion friends sacrifice themselves...

W:
I suppose that's just their fate though.

W:
Such pitiful things.

Misha:
...

W:
Ah, that's right.

W:
Even though you saw everything that happened...

W:
Y'know, ahh, how do I put this... I really don't have the spare energy to drag Skullshatterer back to Chernobog...

Misha:
Shut up!

W:
I'm just telling the truth.

W:
I mean, the situation here is hopeless after all~

W:
Hurry and let me know once you've cleared your head, okay?

Misha:
No...

Misha:
I swear I'll...

Misha:
Bring Skullshatterer back to life.

Misha:
Skullshatterer isn't dead... Skullshatterer cannot die.

Misha:
If he was here, he'd protect us... all of us.

Misha:
I just know... this is what he would've done.

Misha:
...

Misha:
Everyone is just like me. We're all Infected.

Misha:
I am also... one of them.

Misha:
We have nowhere to go...

Misha:
Everyone... needs to be protected.

Misha:
This...

Misha:
...

Misha:
...is Skullshatterer's legacy.
