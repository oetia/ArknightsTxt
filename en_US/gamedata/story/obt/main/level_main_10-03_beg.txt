9:27 A.M. \ Overcast

Atop the wall, Sudean Borough, Londinium

Sarkaz Warrior:
There's been a riot at Port 309!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Tell the general the patrol squad has sniffed out the rebels.

Sarkaz Warrior:
It's not just the rebels! We're exchanging fire with multiple groups––

Sarkaz Warrior:
General, can you get us backup?

Manfred:
No need.

Manfred:
How are we doing?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Debugging will take roughly another fifteen minutes.

Manfred:
You've got eight.

Manfred:
We don't have time to spare here.

???:
You don't need me to go see what's going on down there? Just a suggestion, of course.

Manfred:
You're worried I'll fail.

???:
Of course not. When have your plans ever failed?

???:
My job is just to make sure we've got fewer unknowns along our path to victory.

Manfred:
You've already done more than enough, mercenary.

Manfred:
Come, stand with me. I need you to see for yourself what is going on beneath these walls, before the experiment begins.

Hoederer:
......

Hoederer:
Lively.

Manfred:
How does it compare to the battlefields of Kazdel?

Hoederer:
Nothing new.

Hoederer:
But at least... it's not Sarkaz on both sides tearing each other apart.

Manfred:
Surely you hunted, during your time in Kazdel.

Hoederer:
You're asking if I've been hunting? Us mercs are out in the wilderness all year 'round. Hunting is how we get fed.

Manfred:
Then, you should understand why I left these ports open.

Hoederer:
Sometimes, even if your trap is obvious, a beast will step right into it because there's no other choice.

Hoederer:
If it can't find a way out, it'll panic and run wild. That means we've got to expend energy and spread our forces thin to round up all the wild beasts.

Manfred:
Sure. That's how things go in the wilds, but there's more to it.

Manfred:
Look at the city below us. It is little more than a concrete wilderness.

Manfred:
Who has the confidence to seal off every exit to the wilds themselves? Who can find every nook and cranny in a jungle? Who can secure every last potential hiding spot?

Manfred:
I am certainly not so conceited.

Hoederer:
So that's why you left a few openings. Focus your attention, and wait for the enemies to reveal themselves. That's a pretty efficient way of dealing with it.

Manfred:
But it does come with one risk.

Hoederer:
Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?

Hoederer:
If I was in your position, I'd do the same thing.

Manfred:
Good. If you're capable of leading mercenaries, you're capable of leading the hunt.

Manfred:
That's why I'd rather fight alongside you than the relics in the Court.

Hoederer:
And by the looks of things, you'll be feasting tonight.

Hoederer:
Not just the rebels, but Dublinn as well...

Hoederer:
Wait, I've seen that caster before. She came to see you once. Didn't you sign a truce? Not that either of you took it particularly seriously.

Manfred:
If you recognize her, then you should also know that people like her don't know when to stop.

Hoederer:
You've been wanting to eliminate that variable for a while now, huh?

Manfred:
The situation has changed. His Majesty's opus is reaching its conclusion. If the theatre is too rowdy, it is too easy to overlook an actual threat.

Manfred:
We need to keep a closer eye on the dukes out there.

Hoederer:
Couldn't you just send me to do that?

Manfred:
If I wanted her dead, I wouldn't even need you.

Hoederer:
What's the problem then?

Manfred:
'The Iron Guard of Wellington.'

Hoederer:
You mean...

Manfred:
He hasn't made a move on Londinium yet.

Manfred:
And if he's quiet for even a single day, all the nobles outside Londinium ask their emissaries, first thing in the morning, whether the Iron Duke has spoken.

Hoederer:
Okay.

Manfred:
Which is why we haven't made an enemy of Dublinn, so far.

Manfred:
Now though, since she's the one who lost control and took the first step toward violating our agreement––

Manfred:
The Sarkaz have no more reason to continue tolerating them.

Hoederer:
So the commotion down there is just the beginning.

Manfred:
Yes. We still need something... more decisive, to take Dublinn out of the picture.

Mandragora:
Where the hell did they come from?

Dublinn Soldier:
I don't know, Captain... I haven't seen these weapons or Arts before!

Mandragora:
They're also fighting the Sarkaz... They're not here to back up the devils?

Mandragora:
Not that it matters. We'll eliminate anyone who gets in our way.

Indra:
Hey––

Indra:
Give us our guy back!

Dublinn Soldier:
It's... It's you!

Indra:
Oh, a familiar face? Too bad I still recognize you after the pummeling I gave you this morning.

Dagda:
Look out behind you––

Dagda:
People don't just stand around in a fight and wait for you to run up to them swinging.

Indra:
Isn't that why I have you?

Dagda:
Don't go too crazy. Remember, we're getting out of here as soon as we secure our target.

Indra:
I know.

Indra:
That just means I gotta punch faster.

Mandragora:
You're telling me... these are the ones who snatched our mark?

Mandragora:
Don't forget their faces.

Mandragora:
No, wait a moment... Try to capture one of them alive. I'm sure the Leader would be interested to find out what new power has its eyes on Londinium.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Uhh... Where are these rocks coming from?

Siege:
......

Siege:
Stay on your guard. We're still not inside the city yet, and the Doctor doesn't want to see anyone get hurt.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Alright... You too!

Mandragora:
She smashed my construct to pieces with one swing of a hammer?

Mandragora:
This one... she's just as nasty as that Victorian soldier!

Mandragora:
I wasn't even trying for that one though... See how you like this instead!

Rhodes Island Operator:
Get out of the way, Siege!

Siege:
Who covered me?

Siege:
Balin, did you see who that was?

Rhodes Island Operator:
No, there's too much going on. I can't make heads or tails of it.

Siege:
Amiya, there's somebody else in this fight.

Siege:
Someone besides us, Dublinn, and the Sarkaz...

Siege:
And they just might be on our side.

Dublinn Soldier:
Captain, the situation isn't looking good for us... Do you think you could bring down this entire wall...?

Mandragora:
The entire wall, huh? Hah... I've fantasized about it too many times...

Mandragora:
But, not now. We'll still have our chance, whenever the Leader decides to come.

Mandragora:
Let's not get too carried away here, and just grit our teeth for the time being...

Mandragora:
Hear me. Pack your weapons and try not to leave a mess. I don't want that Manfred devil to come knocking on my door ahead of schedule.

Manfred:
Four minutes. We'll wait four more minutes.

Manfred:
As it happens, our men haven't had a chance to do anything fun. Defending a city like Londinium is worlds apart from raiding Lateran caravans in the wilderness.

Hoederer:
The nice thing about meeting old friends is you don't have to worry about them taking your head. I've got nothing to complain about.

Manfred:
Don't mistake yourself for one of them.

Manfred:
There aren't a lot of mercenaries out there who could stand being locked up in a little courtyard, reading books all day. That's your department.

Hoederer:
I do remember thanking you when you scooped me up and gave me back my sword.

Manfred:
Enough. You're not here to share me this drivel.

Hoederer:
Sure, I know.

Hoederer:
You need mercenaries, and for more than a couple reasons.

Manfred:
Indeed... And you're as good as they come.

Manfred:
Coincidentally, a few more mercenary squads have joined up with us recently, including some of your old acquaintances from the Scar Market.

Hoederer:
What mercenary could resist an offer from the Regent himself?

Manfred:
They want more than just the payout from completing a contract or two.

Manfred:
When we followed the Regent out of Kazdel, each warrior carried a different weapon, some even wearing armor that belonged to the enemy just moments ago.

Manfred:
But what about now?

Manfred:
As you've seen, the factories of Londinium now work day and night to produce weapons and armor for us. Our troops are well-regulated, and take orders as a unified unit.

Manfred:
We are united as never before, and that makes our solidarity stronger than ever.

Hoederer:
Yes, all of Victoria... No, all of Terra is watching.

Hoederer:
All according to the Regent's calculations.

Manfred:
Just a year ago, they guffawed about how Londinium's defenses were impenetrable. They thought we were mercenaries in service to some duke.

Manfred:
Profit is no longer the only thing that motivates mercenaries... They are all looking to see what the Sarkaz can do.

Hoederer:
What's a sellsword who's lost interest in selling his sword?

Manfred:
We're not asking our compatriots to give up their status as mercenaries. They simply found other reasons to follow the Regent.

Manfred:
They believe he has created a turning point in the fate of the Sarkaz. That we have an opportunity to earn a new identity for ourselves, not just as looters and servants of the powerful.

Hoederer:
You need a home to have an identity.

Hoederer:
'When the Sarkaz desire war, the Sarkaz become war itself––'

Manfred:
'––And when each battle ends, the Sarkaz have a home to return to.'

Manfred:
This is what the Regent told all the Sarkaz in Londinium. You saw it yourself. That was the first time we met.

Manfred:
I asked what you thought about that statement.

Hoederer:
'If you're a fighter who crawled out of the ruins of Kazdel, how could you say no to that?'

Manfred:
It was three years ago I heard that answer.

Manfred:
Since then, you've left that estate, and now stand with me.

Manfred:
Do you still... hold the same belief?

Hoederer:
Manfred, you've earned my loyalty.

Manfred:
......

Manfred:
Does your left eye still hurt?

Hoederer:
It's been over a year. It healed a long time ago.

Manfred:
I... hope you understand. I've never doubted our friendship, not once since that day.

Manfred:
But you know what I'm talking about.

Hoederer:
The Confessarii don't drop their guard around a merc. That's how they look after the Regent.

Hoederer:
And I... I'm not here to prove my loyalty to anyone. That'd just make me a weaker blade in a fight.

Manfred:
So your answer is still 'no.'

Manfred:
That's fine too.

Manfred:
Sometimes, what I need more is a friend, and for that, Kazdel must temporarily endure the absence of an officer.

Sarkaz Warrior:
We're ready, General!

Manfred:
Excellent.

Manfred:
Tell the patrol to retreat immediately.

Manfred:
Activate the automatic aiming system and enter the long-distance targeting coordinates––

Manfred:
––Coordinates, Sudean Borough, Port 309.

Manfred:
Our efforts over the last few months are finally about to bear fruit.

Manfred:
Hoederer, will you do the honors?

Londinium Citizen?:
Lieutenant, Dublinn looks like they're about to win.

Horn:
That's not the situation, but it's also not what matters.

Horn:
Regardless of who wins, what's important is that they keep each other in check.

Horn:
That's the situation we need, one that allows your people to charge.

Londinium Citizen?:
Charge...?

Horn:
Indeed. While they're too occupied with us, that's your best opportunity to get out of the city.

Londinium Citizen?:
No... No!

Horn:
What's on your mind, Robben?

Londinium Citizen?:
Lieutenant, I don't want to leave anymore.

Horn:
But...

Londinium Citizen?:
I have to stay.

Horn:
But this might be the only chance you have to leave Londinium!

Horn:
After the scuffle here today, the Sarkaz will have the gate blocked tomorrow.

Horn:
Conceal your weapons and blend in with the other civilians! Hurry, get going!

Londinium Citizen?:
We can't just run away like this.

Londinium Citizen?:
Lieutenant, we can still fight.

Londinium Citizen?:
Did you see that? I just took down a Dublinn fighter and injured two Sarkaz!

Londinium Citizen?:
This crossbow is... pretty crude. It's nothing like the standard-issue military crossbows we're used to.

Londinium Citizen?:
You made it, right? If you even need to make your weapons yourself, don't you also need more men?

Horn:
It's not a question of what I need...

Horn:
If you don't want to leave, I won't force you.

Horn:
I don't want to order another good soldier out of the fight, not again, not when she wanted to stay...

Londinium Citizen?:
Lieutenant...?

Horn:
But let's set that aside for now.

Horn:
We need to get out of here first.

Horn:
Now's the best shot we're going to get, so if you don't want to move onwards, then fall back with us!

Amiya:
Doctor, the Sarkaz troops are withdrawing from the fight.

Amiya:
I find it strange that after fighting us and Dublinn for so long, the Sarkaz didn't call in reinforcements or start massacring the Dublinn forces.

Amiya:
That's not how the Sarkaz usually fight. Even the mercenaries that W brought with her into Reunion fought more ferociously than they did.

Amiya:
Doctor, have we fallen into a trap?

Amiya:
This conflict came about so spontaneously and coincidentally... It's as if someone was trying to corral us all together, and then...

Amiya:
Umm, do you think they set all this up for us?

Amiya:
Siege said she found other people who were blending into the crowd just like us... and they seemed to be on the civilians' side.

Amiya:
Might they be the ones the Sarkaz were after?

Siege:
The Doctor ordered a retreat.

Indra:
Huh? We're about to complete our rescue though!

Siege:
There must be a reason behind it. Let's go.

Indra:
Grr.

Londinium Citizen:
Excuse me, Miss Indra! I, I'm over here!

Indra:
Thomas?

Siege:
Don't go over there!

Indra:
I...

A flash of light suddenly fills everyone's eyes.

A scalding wave of heat erupts forth, incinerating almost everything it touches.

Though very little solid debris shoots out, the force of the impact reminds the survivors how they were only a single step from death.

And this threat... came from above.

Indra:
What just happened?!

Indra:
Did we get a bomb dropped on us? A huge crater... suddenly appeared in the ground?!

Indra:
Thomas... *cough* *cough*... The smoke's too thick, I can't see anything!

Dagda:
Indra!

Dagda:
Siege told you to stop.

Indra:
Fine, I owe you another one.

Dagda:
As long as you get it. Now hurry, let's get out of here––
