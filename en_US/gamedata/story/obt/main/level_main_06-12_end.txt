Reunion Member:
The... the Yetis...

Reunion Member:
...I feel so bad for them to all die in Lungmen like that. One less hope, one less legend for the Infected.

Reunion Member:
Move it. The L. G. D. are on the way.

Nine:
I know.

Reunion Member:
...There's something not quite right about your eyes.

Reunion Member:
To be honest, I always thought you were a spy for Lungmen.

Nine:
How about now?

Reunion Member:
No one would believe it anyway.

Nine:
A real spy would kill you to keep you quiet.

Reunion Member:
I'm not worried about you killing me. Look at the state of Lungmen. Even if you were a Lungmenite, you can't go back.

Reunion Member:
You'd have an even worse time than we did.

Nine:
...So I'm not. I'm not really anything anymore.

Reunion Member:
What are you doing? Wow, is that a flower?

Reunion Member:
Oooh, is this your Arts? It's pretty.

Nine:
Someone has to leave them a token of respect.

Censor:
Such dilly-dallying... such a waste of time.

???:
I think it was well done. I can give top marks for wiping out the entire Reunion Movement in the city of Lungmen in a single day.

???:
Wei Yenwu is impressive.

???:
Taihe, have you heard that rumor?

Censor:
You speak of Wei Yenwu's history?

Taihe:
Delve not into such things.

???:
Forgive me. But how do the skills of the Black Cloaks compare to those of the Imperial Guard?

Censor:
Hmph. You overestimate them. But they do indeed have some exceptional skill...

Taihe:
Look out!

???:
You bastards!!!

Censor:
——Infected?

???:
Hiss!

Blaze:
——Wire?!

???:
You don't really want to kill me, do you? You can use Arts.

Blaze:
I've always heard that men who use wires as weapons are all, literally all, psychopaths.

???:
Indeed, they do say that...

Censor:
Infected, do not interfere with official business. Take care that I lump you in with the others.

Blaze:
Not much to be done about unidentified armed units getting killed on the battlefield, is there?

???:
We can likewise testify that you are acting in coordination with Reunion.

Ch'en:
You don't have the authority to investigate my partner.

???:
We are well aware that a vessel belonging to an 'Infected Countermeasures Specialist' is docked in a Lungmen berth, Superintendent Ch'en. This is the only reason Miss Blaze has not yet come to harm.

Ch'en:
Then how much more do you need to see? How much more must you test the people of this city with their very lives?

Censor:
Speak with respect. We are assessing Lungmen's risk control capabilities due to the importance with which we regard you.

Ch'en:
Then forgive me. I'll rephrase.

Ch'en:
Are you enjoying this farce?

Censor:
Pfft.

Ch'en:
Stand down, Blaze. We do not serve these fine, upstanding individuals, and they're not with the raincoats either.

???:
Apologies, Miss Blaze. I hope I did not cause you any displeasure.

Blaze:
...You're very polite. But your tone pisses me off.

???:
You have an ear for Yan speech.

???:
You inherited much from your father. Alas, now you are but an Infected. Your path is rough. And short.

Blaze:
......You......?

Taihe:
Come.

???:
Goodbye then, Miss Blaze, Superintendent Ch'en.

Blaze:
Wait! What did you just say about my dad?!

Blaze:
Stop!

Amiya:
Blaze!

Blaze:
......

Amiya:
Remember the mission!

Blaze:
Right.

Amiya:
Officer Ch'en.

Ch'en:
We found no trace of the enemy commander.

Amiya:
Which?

Ch'en:
We only know of Mephisto.

Amiya:
Let Rhodes Island handle the rest.

Ch'en:
No need to rush into it. This campaign is all but over.

Amiya:
But he has to pay... for the atrocities he committed.

Ch'en:
Then we'll leave it to you.

Ch'en:
Let's part ways for now. I have one more thing I need to see with my own eyes.

Ch'en:
Wait a minute, L. G. D. lady.

Ch'en:
What is it?

Blaze:
...Thanks for that, back there.

Blaze:
That's all.

Ch'en:
Sure. You too.

Amiya:
Why did you have to pick that moment to act? Blaze... You're not the type to make mistakes at a time like this.

Blaze:
For one thing, I was really mad...

Blaze:
For another, I could tell that L. G. D. lady, Ch'en, was getting mad too.

Amiya:
We also can't tell which of the two sides has the right to speak.

Blaze:
So I pick the one I like.

Blaze:
Sorry. It won't happen again.

Amiya:
...No, Blaze. It's my turn to say it won't happen again.

Amiya:
But I can't say that. I can't promise that.

Amiya:
The Yetis...

Blaze:
......

Blaze:
Silly rabbit.

Amiya:
Hey, don't pat my head. I need to get taller...

Amiya:
...At least, don't pat it too long.

Blaze:
I know, I know.

???:
How do you feel?

Kal'tsit:
I was in the neighborhood.

Kal'tsit:
Your emotional state is fluctuating. It seems you had a deeper interaction with this Reunion unit in the Chernobog ruins.

Kal'tsit:
As far as I can tell, the captain of this unit did not participate in the battle.

Kal'tsit:
Lungmen won't keep chasing these Infected. But Rhodes Island has to do more.

Kal'tsit:
Lungmen won't interfere with what happens next. And you can choose not to participate.

Kal'tsit:
...But you will participate. Whether the Infected is codenamed 'Mephisto' or 'FrostNova.'

Kal'tsit:
I have my work cut out for me.

Kal'tsit:
Oh, and Dr. {@nickname}......

Kal'tsit:
Don't look at me like that.

Kal'tsit:
But you and I don't need trust.

Kal'tsit:
You need the trust of Rhodes Island's operators, not me.

Kal'tsit:
——I know you too well to trust you. Just like you never trusted me, in the old days.

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
Right.

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
I misspoke. Forget it.

Kal'tsit:
Be careful in the next operation. Only the most dangerous of commanders would train such a squad of Infected who would fight to the death without flinching.

Kal'tsit:
Of course, it's up to you if you want to see it through to the end.

Kal'tsit:
And do conserve your energy. We may not have time to rest.

Kal'tsit:
It's not that simple. At least, that's what I think.

Kal'tsit:
Dr. {@nickname}, from now on, it's up to you to decide if you will shoulder the burden of responsibility for Rhodes Island...

Kal'tsit:
...'Whether or not to be one worthy of the trust of a Rhodes Island operator.'

Phantom Crossbowman:
Ah, FrostNova, ma'am, you're awake...

Phantom Crossbowman:
...Take it easy! Let me help you.

FrostNova:
I'm fine. I'm not... so fragile.

Phantom Crossbowman:
——

Phantom Crossbowman:
Where are you going? You can't go back.

FrostNova:
......

FrostNova:
Then, my brothers and sisters...

Phantom Crossbowman:
...You can't go back!

Phantom Crossbowman:
It was for your sake that they...

FrostNova:
Don't insult my squad!

Phantom Crossbowman:
Ugh!

FrostNova:
They did... *cough* look out for me.

FrostNova:
But it was for the Infected that they gave their lives so bravely!

FrostNova:
They fought their last battle so that more of their people could live, not for the sake of any one person!

FrostNova:
*Cough* *cough hack* *cough*...

FrostNova:
*Cough* Guh... Mmg...

Phantom Crossbowman:
FrostNova, ma'am...

FrostNova:
Enough with the ma'am. Are you calling me that because I look weak to you?

Phantom Crossbowman:
......!

Phantom Crossbowman:
Sorry!

Phantom Crossbowman:
It's just, they put you in our care like this.

FrostNova:
And now they're gone, and I never got to keep my promises to them.

FrostNova:
I don't even have a chance to make amends.

Phantom Crossbowman:
FrostNova...

FrostNova:
...The one slumped at the wall there.

FrostNova:
Mephisto.

FrostNova:
He's still unconscious?

Phantom Crossbowman:
We don't know. He's been like that the whole time. He says nothing. Does nothing.

FrostNova:
......

FrostNova:
Take him back. It's enough.

Phantom Crossbowman:
Understood. Phew, I thought you'd...

FrostNova:
I'd what?

Phantom Crossbowman:
I thought you'd kill him.

FrostNova:
There's no need for that anymore. I think I know what happened outside the slums.

FrostNova:
That disheartened look in his eyes...

Phantom Crossbowman:
Oh...?

FrostNova:
...And, from time to time...

FrostNova:
I recall that day, three or four years ago, when he tried his very hardest to sing.

Phantom Crossbowman:
He can sing? But Faust said, his throat...

FrostNova:
He really tried.

FrostNova:
Just like all of us Infected. Though we will all someday succumb to Oripathy...

FrostNova:
We still try our very hardest to live.

FrostNova:
Let the rest of his life continue to punish him.

FrostNova:
Tell me, Phantom Crossbowman, was Rhodes Island involved in that fight?

Phantom Crossbowman:
Do you mean...?

Phantom Crossbowman:
...No, as far as I know, they didn't fight the Yetis.

FrostNova:
...So childish.

Phantom Crossbowman:
Are you sure you want to stay?

Phantom Crossbowman:
They may not come after us, FrostNova. You don't have to die here.

FrostNova:
I met a few people in the ruins. I want to see them again.

FrostNova:
I promised them, actually.

FrostNova:
And I know they're coming.

Phantom Crossbowman:
FrostNova...

FrostNova:
Go on, brother.

FrostNova:
Reunion lost this battle. And just maybe, Reunion did wrong.

FrostNova:
But you haven't. You still have a choice, you can do better.

FrostNova:
Go on. And don't look back.
