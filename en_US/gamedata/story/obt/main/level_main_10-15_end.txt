Manfred:
You're already down to your last few men.

Manfred:
On any past battlefield, Victoria would've needed at least two or more Steam Knights in order to hold me off.

Manfred:
But look at yourselves now—

Manfred:
You're just a bunch of plain soldiers.

Horn:
—Hold formation!

Horn:
Those who still have energy in your shields! Stand together with me!

Horn:
Snipers, sustain fire, pin him!

Robben:
Yes, Captain!

Horn:
I've said it before—no matter how strong he is, he's still just a flesh-and-blood Sarkaz Infected. His Arts have a limit!

Manfred:
You want to wait until I cast my body dry?

Manfred:
You'll never live to see me exhaust my strength.

Victorian Soldier:
Ugh!

Horn:
Blake!

Victorian Soldier:
Horn, take my sword—

Horn:
—Got it.

Manfred:
When they fall, they turn their gazes to you, still with hope.

Manfred:
I never thought I'd see such brilliance in Londinium again.

Manfred:
But how much longer can this fragile light persist?

Robben:
Horn!

Horn:
...Robben?

Robben:
*pant*... *pant*... No cause for alarm... falling here... just returning... returning... back to Londinium's land.

Horn:
......

Horn:
Sarkaz!!!

Manfred:
You fired all of your remaining ammunition at once?

Manfred:
Well done. You've stopped me in my tracks for the first time.

Manfred:
But after this, you're out of tricks.

Manfred:
After you watch your comrades die one by one, will you lose the will to fight too, White Wolf?

Horn:
......

Horn:
Sarkaz... So long as you occupy our cities, I will always have a reason to fight.

Horn:
My desire to defeat you is shared with every Victorian.

Manfred:
Your shield is of little use now.

Horn:
I still have a sword.

Manfred:
Your sword... heh, common as could be.

Manfred:
You want to battle me with a sword like this?

Horn:
*huff*... Don't underestimate it, or me.

Horn:
You're so fond of remembering... the Steam Knights...

Horn:
When you take off the armor that Victoria forged them...

Horn:
They turn out just to be—

Horn:
Victorians!

Feist:
We actually... got inside? Why has this wall turned so soft?

Closure:
Not bad! For an instant back there, I thought I was gonna get my head painted over Londinium's walls!

Amiya:
It was Misery's Arts. He wouldn't see us hurt.

Misery:
Right... Kal'tsit told me your brain was an important asset to Rhodes Island.

Closure:
My hands don't come cheap either, c'mon!

Closure:
After that, I'm never asking to hitchhike with you again... Blaze carrying me everywhere is a way smoother ride than your Arts!

Closure:
Am I right or am I right, Doctor?

Amiya:
I agree. Misery, I saw it clearly... Manfred almost impaled you with that thrust.

Misery:
That was just a desperation blow. He had no other move.

Misery:
You successfully provoked his rage, and that made him overlook my approach. I didn't even think I could fool him twice.

Amiya:
I didn't at all intend to...

Amiya:
When he asked me that, I definitely felt his anger. That rage of his rushed at me like a heatwave.

Misery:
If Manfred uses all his strength, anyone nearby would have trouble lasting for long. Best I... *cough* *cough* *cough*...

Amiya:
Misery, I know you want to help that Victorian officer, but using large-scale matter-transformation Arts several times in one day is too taxing on your body.

Misery:
It's okay, Amiya.

Misery:
I won't drop dead for a while yet. Besides, I promised Kal'tsit...

Amiya:
You elite operators... make plenty of promises to Dr. Kal'tsit, don't you?

Amiya:
Inject these emergency meds into yourself. The fight in Londinium's only just begun, and I don't want to see you off somewhere alone again, swallowing down all the blood you're practically throwing up.

Misery:
Amiya, enemies inbound.

Amiya:
Hm. Misery found us a weak point in Londinium's defense system... We need to see this control room destroyed.

Manfred:
Blistering speed—White Wolf, this was your true aim, wasn't it?

Manfred:
Fangs and claws as fierce as these, yet tamed by Victoria's noble etiquette... Was it really worth it?

Horn:
Sarkaz, wasn't your present appearance once packaged in so-called culture?

Horn:
I hear your people used to look very different.

Manfred:
You can try your hardest, but you still cannot kill me. So long as this city's defenses continue to churn—

Manfred:
No. Wait. White Wolf, you're only stalling me!

Manfred:
You—You and Rhodes Island are collaborating again.

Manfred:
Do you know who they are? Do you know what that Cautus leader...?

Horn:
I only know—that they can stop you.

Manfred:
White Wolf, should you miraculously succeed today... you will witness a corner of Londinium's walls collapse, with your own eyes.

Manfred:
Is that what you want to see? From this moment on, the legend of Londinium everstanding may well no longer—

Horn:
From this moment on?

Horn:
The fact you can be stood here means... the idea that Londinium has never fallen is nothing more than a self-reassuring joke.

Manfred:
Damn you! If those dukes outside take note of this—

Horn:
Are you aware? You're finally showing a hint of panic in your face.

Horn:
That goes to show my decision was the correct one.

Horn:
If this wall... only exists to smother the screams of the Victorians from within, then it's already lost its founding purpose.

Horn:
You ought to let those dukes hear!

Horn:
Hear... how our fellow citizens cry out under your slaughter!

Londinium Citizen:
How... How much longer until we can go outside?

Londinium Citizen:
Oh... it feels like this passage is about to collapse... are we all going to die here?

Heidi:
Don't look down, and don't look back.

Heidi:
If the fear gets too much, just stare at the way ahead.

Heidi:
The signal light's still on. This is our hope that our soldiers lit for us.

Heidi:
We wait for the light as it turns bright... and then we can catch sight of the sun in Londinium once again.

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
Their firepower's too strong—

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
Rockrock, we can't get any closer to the train.

Rockrock:
......

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
The bombardment hasn't stopped... Can the people down below still hold out? How much time do we have left?

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
There's been no word from the commander's end...

Rockrock:
I... I believe in my family.

Rockrock:
That's the one and only reason I've kept on this far.

Indra:
Bloody hell, I can't get these things off me!

Morgan:
That's not it... You saw how fast they were a moment ago?

Morgan:
He's slowing them on purpose, like he's... just watching how long we can run for...

Indra:
What kind of sicko is he?

???:
Mmm... listen to the sound of your breaths, your pulses. Are you finally tired out?

Siege:
Is this... the honor of the Sarkaz?

Siege:
This isn't fit to be called a battle.

???:
...Battle?

???:
You seem to have the wrong idea.

???:
The 'King of Sarkaz' isn't here, so I'm left with no matching opponent at all.

???:
Would you converse with a meatbeast about glory or honor? When you know full well that hunting them serves to do nothing but excite your senses, that their only ultimate service is as an entrée on your dinner table?

Siege:
You treat us... as prey?

Siege:
You may be a Sarkaz, but slaughtering like this out of pure personal taste is still far too barbaric.

???:
Do not appraise me by your understanding of culture. It would be the most hideous kind of slander to me.

???:
Try and resist me, before the filthy rubble pummels you into mincemeat here.

???:
I will borrow your blood to record your feelings at death's door... all your fear, unwillingness, anger... Let them burst forth upon me to your heart's content!

Indra:
Vina, get over here—

Siege:
No.

Morgan:
Vina!

Siege:
Morgan, you fall back too.

Siege:
Urgh...

Clovisia:
You're going to stand in front of all of us, and resist him?

Siege:
Yes.

Clovisia:
You're no match for him.

Siege:
I know.

Clovisia:
And you're not planning to turn and flee, even if you'll be shredded in an instant, have your flesh leave the dullest stain in this whole tunnel?

Siege:
Only if... you can all run faster than I can.

Clovisia:
Why?

Siege:
Because...

Siege:
There is no because. I just want to do this.

Siege:
When the city above us falls towards us, I want to be the first to embrace it in that instant.

Clovisia:
If that's so...

The signal light in the passage seems to glow brighter.

Are her eyes failing her? Why is there starlight in Londinium's underground? No... how long have they gone without seeing the stars behind the clouds, even on the surface?

Siege blinks.

She suddenly realizes that is no star.

It is a button.

The detritus that caked it has been shaken off, and now it is shining, and she has the exact fortune to know what it does.

She was first brought underneath the palace at three years of age.

Her mentor carried her upon his back, using a tremendous paw to guide her in pushing this button.

Londinium's subterranean sprawled about its own muscle and bone, exposing to the future liege its veins and arteries, filled with life.

Over twenty years later—

She has found it for the second time.

Closure:
Bombs mounted at all nodes!

Feist:
Doctor, I've got our retreat ready!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Move it, they're in here, stop them—

Amiya:
Urgh...

Closure:
Amiya! Dammit, how are they coming so thick and fast... did Misery leave too late? Did they not stall Manfred?

Amiya:
I'll hold them off! All of you, go!

Amiya:
Doctor, give the detonator to me—

Amiya:
You won't have a chance to retreat unless I lock down these enemies!

Amiya:
Once you've successfully withdrawn, I'll blow up this control room straight away—

Amiya:
Doctor, we can't wait any longer! Think of the Self-Salvation Corps' fighters, Victoria's soldiers, Lady Heidi and Siege's team...

Amiya:
And every single Victorian being bombarded right now! None of us can hold on anymore!

Amiya:
Doctor...!

Sarkaz Warrior:
*cough* *cough*... These black lines are everywhere... I can't see anything!

Amiya:
Now!

Amiya:
Doctor, why are you... in front of me?

Amiya:
I'm not... not the weak child I was anymore...

Amiya:
I won't drag you down anymore. I can withstand these Arts, and these flames.

Amiya:
Doctor...

Feist:
Oof... caught you!

Feist:
Wondered why you asked me for those six ziplines, Doctor. This is what it was for?

Feist:
It'll be hard to move about, but... oh well, not as if you run fast ordinarily...

Closure:
Fly, my drones!

Closure:
How's that for a surprise, Doctor? In response to your demands, I've tinkered on my drones and finally developed—a people-towing glider function!

Closure:
There's a cap on its long-term use, but at least it'll get us safely on the ground—

Manfred:
The control room—!

Horn:
They... did it...

Horn:
Urgh...

Manfred:
How... How long ago did you tire out? You can't even brandish your sword now...

Manfred:
You really were doing nothing but... making a stand with all you had.

Manfred:
Anyone else with your wounds would be in a coma ten times over by now!

Horn:
Now you realize? Slow, aren't you.

Manfred:
......

Sarkaz Warrior:
General, the explosion in the control room has affected the cannons. The batteries and the minor section of the wall structure here have all been severely damaged—

Sarkaz Warrior:
If we hang around here any longer, we'll fall!

Manfred:
Notify all hands, retreat!

Sarkaz Warrior:
What about this soldier?

Manfred:
I've defeated her already, but toppling her would require spending more effort still.

Manfred:
And it's not worth spending the time here any longer.

Horn:
Ha... haha...

Manfred:
White Wolf of Victoria, you are a worthy opponent.

Manfred:
Should you live to descend this city wall—

Manfred:
Then next time we meet, by my sword... I will send you to a death befittingly heroic.

Horn:
Next time...

Will there be a next time?

Londinium's wall is falling down.

And so she endlessly falls too.

Horn:
I... I did it.

Horn:
Until... you all left...

Horn:
...I did not fall.

Her blood flows out, and she almost loses the last speck of awareness she has.

But her body is as if a part of her sword and shield at this point, harder than steel, unbending unless shattered.

The weapon forged by Victoria still stands upon Londinium's wall.

So the soldier She tempered to fruition keeps her watch upon it too.

Until a corner of it crashes to its city's ground—

And she returns to the land that raised her.

Horn:
Just how tall... is this wall?

Horn:
Why is it like...

...I'm flying up?

???:
Horn, can you still move? Grab my hand, quick!

Horn:
...Robben?

Horn:
You're... not...

Robben:
Yes, I'm not dead! I was lucky enough to grab onto the outside structure when I fell, and then Mr. Misery here saved me again!

Misery:
Come, soldier. You haven't finished your fight yet.

Horn:
You lot, honestly. You won't ever let me rest, will you?

Robben:
Nope!

Robben:
Horn, don't shut your eyes! Don't forget, your soldier is still here! You can't fall!

Horn:
Robben, you've turned as noisy as... as a certain someone, now.

Horn:
Oh, forget it... I've never been able to do anything about you lot.

Her vision becomes clear once again.

The city wall of Londinium is still there, and though its highest height is now adorned by the tiniest hole, it still seems as towering, as unyielding as ever.

Morgan:
What's that shaking?

Indra:
Artillery finally do the underground structure in?

Morgan:
No, that's not it.

Morgan:
This shaking's coming from underneath us—

Morgan:
Vina, what did you do?

Siege:
I've found a path we can walk.

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
Is this whole tunnel... moving up?

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
How? You'd think we'd know it could do that after living here for so long, right?

Clovisia:
There are always some 'locals' who'll know more than others.

Siege:
......

Indra:
That monster...

Indra:
Is it still gonna come after?

Siege:
It will.

Siege:
But maybe not today.

???:
So you found a new course to flee down?

???:
Ah... but of course, but of course.

???:
This scent... is it that Feline, giving it off?

???:
No... so-called royal families are no more than a lie, so called to consolidate power and coin, as laughable as this nation's culture.

???:
Even if she is that runaway's cub, the smell of her blood would be no different to any other Feline.

???:
So, this completely different scent...

???:
Interesting.

???:
Does Theresis know about this?

You'll have no chance to verify for yourself.

???:
Oh?

???:
I remember who you are. You're that... little disciple by Theresis's side. Even if your teacher was stood right here, he would be troubled to apprehend me.

He's no longer fit to be my teacher anymore.

???:
Hm?

???:
This odor of cursecraft... So you've come too, Banshee? I'd thought you were in that city right now, playing games with my entourage.

Trifling, unpracticed Artists. They weren't enough to hinder my step.

???:
*sigh*... That makes things tricky.

???:
This underpass on the verge of collapse is no fine place for the Royal Court to congregate.

Am I nothing in his eyes? Just because I didn't learn my skills from Theresis, or have any noble blood?

This long-winded old man's genuinely pissed me off. I'm going to gift him a hundred bombs as a farewell present. Any of you have any objections?

Manfred:
...Report.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Rhodes Island's people have jumped out from the control room. They had that Cautus, so we couldn't snipe them—

Manfred:
And the rebels in the underground tunnels?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Er, we detected an explosion from beneath... and the Sanguinarch hasn't returned yet.

Manfred:
Where is Hoederer?

Sarkaz Warrior:
He's severely wounded, and currently unconscious.

Manfred:
......

Manfred:
Assemble what workers remain, and have them inspect the city defense systems and report the damages. We must be prepared to activate more batteries... and even the main cannons.

Manfred:
Surround the remaining individuals at the station. The surviving rebels will be sure to pass through there.

Sarkaz Warrior:
The... The scouts are reporting, they've detected another group rapidly closing in on the station—

Manfred:
......

???:
Manfred, don't blame yourself too much. You've already tried your hardest.

Manfred:
What are you doing here—

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
Rockrock, take a look at the city wall—

Rockrock:
The defense artillery's been... shut down?

Rockrock:
Send the signal!

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
They're coming, they're all coming!

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
But the Sarkaz... they're all rushing this way!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Stop them! Kill every last one!

Rockrock:
If we can just repel the Sarkaz, we can start up the train!

Sarkaz Warrior:
You're not getting away that easily!

Rockrock:
Ugh—

Sarkaz Warrior:
How's the rebel army coming from that way too?

Rockrock:
Wh...?

Rockrock:
Is that reinforcements?

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
A team's broken through the Sarkaz forces' blockade from the north side!

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
Who... Who called them in?

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
Did some of the Messengers we sent to the city center survive? Did they get to ask for help?

Victorian Mercenary:
You've done a fine job, my Sudean friends!

Victorian Mercenary:
You can leave the next battle to us now! We're more on the professional end!

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
The way they work... they must have loads of experience...

Rockrock:
Is... Is that Rhodes Island's operator?

Dagda:
—

Dagda:
Break them up!

Dagda:
Make a passage, ensure the Self-Salvation fighters withdraw from the underpass safely!

Dagda:
Snipers, take down those signalers—

Victorian Mercenary:
It's—Miss Montague!

Rockrock:
Montague?

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
That name rings a bell and a half! Some noble in the paper or something?

Rockrock:
Don't get distracted!

Rockrock:
No matter who they are, we're on the same side!

Rockrock:
We can get through! Quick, lead everyone onto the train!

Londinium Citizen:
Oh, wow... Lady Heidi, we've made it...

Heidi:
Mm-hm, I told you. Our soldiers won't let us down.

Clovisia:
They're her people.

Heidi:
Did our Messengers get in contact with her?

Clovisia:
To be more precise, it was your Rhodes Island Messenger.

Indra:
Dagda! Look, it's Dagda!

Morgan:
That tart...

Siege:
Hm.

There among the crowd, Dagda sees them too.

She throws down the Sarkaz she's tussling with, and rushes through the passage made with no hesitation, arms reached out to her partners caked in grime.

Dagda:
I... I was so scared I'd be late.

Siege:
No, you weren't.

Siege:
No matter when you come back, we could never call you late.

Indra:
Bastard, you... you stormed off just like that, remember? I didn't even get to beat you up!

Dagda:
Hm... you're still in time to do it now.

Morgan:
Ay, Vina, did you know she'd come back?

Siege:
I knew.

Morgan:
I get you hid it from Indra. She'd never take help from nobles' mercenaries unless it was critical as this, end-of-the-line type.

Indra:
Stop griping about me and let's get these idiots dealt with first!

Morgan:
I never stopped here!

Morgan:
Vina, I didn't finish... you could've at least given me a shout!

Morgan:
*sigh* You had me wondering if Dagda was off in some corner again even while we were being killed! I was all ready to take the Sarkaz down with me!

Siege:
I'm sorry, Morgan...

Dagda:
This won't happen again. I swear.

Siege:
Siege Group, fully assembled.

Siege:
We just wait for the Doctor's lot to come back, and we can all get out of here together.

???:
Everyone, we're back!

Clovisia:
Amiya?

Clovisia:
Fancy coming in from the sky, all of you...

Closure:
We're touching down! Gangway, outta the way—

Feist:
G—Grab the zipline! Don't crash into the train, it's our only means of escaping alive!

Amiya:
I've got the Doctor held, we're alright!

Closure:
Safe landing!

Feist:
We... We actually made it?

Feist:
Rockrock—

Feist:
Commander, is Rockrock alright? Everyone evacuated out?

Clovisia:
We have more survivors than anticipated.

Clovisia:
It's thanks to you, Feist, and everyone you brought in from Rhodes Island.

Feist:
Hah... You see that, Old Bill?

Feist:
I...

Rockrock:
No, don't you faint on the job now! The battle's still not done!

Rockrock:
If you can move, then come help me in the engine room!

Siege:
There are still Sarkaz forces pursuing us.

Amiya:
There's nothing they can do, now.

Amiya:
Because we'll hold them off here.

Siege:
Right, damned right.

Rockrock:
Commander, the train's setting off—

Clovisia:
All ready?

Siege:
Amiya, we're getting on!

Amiya:
Alright!

Clovisia:
Go!

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
I...

Amiya:
............

The Cautus girl does not reply to you. Her body is still. Even her breathing seems to have stopped.

You can tell she's shocked. She's never let emotions as unveiled and intense show before the operators. This moment is incomparable.

At the same time, the Sarkaz chasing the train all come to a halt.

They all turn their heads, looking in the same direction.

A Sarkaz enters the ruins.

All smoke seems to part at her feet, all sounds of fire suspended about her.

Only wind remains, growing stronger and fiercer.

The ash laden on the ground is blown about, some sticking to her attire, some smudging her pale hair. She seems not to mind at all, only silently gazing into a point of the ruins.

It seems to have once been part of the defense artillery. A jet-black fowlbeast is there now, perched atop the still-warm cannon mouth.

Most likely disturbed by the train picking up in speed, it shakes off its wings.

As if somewhat in response, the pale-haired Sarkaz turns around.

She should have no sight of who is aboard the train, but her expression is as if she has recognized who is looking at her.

Her face is so warm, yet her eyes are so filled with sorrow. The sorrow is so much; perhaps not all of it comes from her, but comes from the one who stares at her too.

The Cautus girl finally comes back to reality.

She still doesn't give you a response, and you're in no rush for her to give one.

In one ear, you hear the calls of fowlbeasts. You see a flock of them out of the window flapping through the air, rushing into the gale ahead of you.

The train takes you rapidly from the station.

The city wall, the war, and that pale-haired figure, all are left far, far behind you.

Rumble. Rumble. Rumble.

Is that the remnants of cannon fire lingering in your brain, the train bumping against the railway, or thunder in those gloomy clouds gathering not far away?

The center of Londinium is right before you.

And all of you are riding into this storm.
