Residence of the Duke of Cumberland, Auchterigg District of Londinium

Sullen Voice:
Your Majesty... I've just received word. Those two pitiful Members have died in their cells.

Impassioned Voice:
An end they deserve. It's time Parliament understood they serve Victoria, and not the businessmen stuffing their pockets with coin.

Sullen Voice:
I understand your eagerness. Still, some are worried. Your pressure on the Court has terrified a great deal of Members who had been observing the situation. They may act with impropriety in days to come.

Impassioned Voice:
They should be fearful! They'll better know their places.

Impassioned Voice:
This unbroken succession of wars whiles away the riches our forebears accumulated over the ages, yet certain greedy condorwings have been reared—fattened by them.

Sullen Voice:
I'm not looking for you to back down, but if we could just go a little slower...

Impassioned Voice:
A little slower! As if the condorwings know when to stop. Why don't you look for <i>them</i> to <i>feed</i> a little slower?

Impassioned Voice:
If we don't put our new tax policies in place, then once the enemy sees fit to pounce on Victoria and tear her flesh apart, even the mercenaries will leave us without a second thought!

Sullen Voice:
If they consider themselves soldiers clear of mind and honorable of heart, they will stand by your side.

Impassioned Voice:
I'm afraid the Red Dragon thought as much too, before he was forced to share half his crown.

Impassioned Voice:
We all saw the end that befell him.

Sullen Voice:
I promise you, no matter the hour, you will have Cumberland's loyalty.

Impassioned Voice:
Of course, 'Cumberland the Ever on High'—how could I doubt where you stand?

Impassioned Voice:
But you see, Robert, Victoria is in her hour of need, this very moment. The right of kings is waning upon this swathe of soil.

Sullen Voice:
Why does Your Majesty think so?

Sullen Voice:
It's your birthday the day after. Everyone is hoping to catch a glimpse of your visage. The servicemen are impatient to pay their respects to you, and the populace's cheers are sure to drown out the parade in turn.

Impassioned Voice:
This year, perhaps. But what of next year? And when it comes time for my Alexandrina to succeed the throne?

Impassioned Voice:
Robert, we <i>will</i> make our exit, sooner or later.

Sullen Voice:
Your Majesty! You—

Victorian Officer:
Your Majesty, Your Grace.

Victorian Officer:
Pardon me for bothering you without permission, but I've just had a report—

Victorian Officer:
There has been an intrusion in the Palace underground. The Sighs of Kings is unaccounted for.

Sullen Voice:
...What?

Victorian Officer:
And... so is Her Highness Alexandrina.

Victorian Officer:
The Guard have sealed off all areas of connection, and the search is underway, but no leads have surfaced for the time being.

Sullen Voice:
Her Highness Alexandrina and the Victorian Realmblade have gone missing at once, in this sensitive a situation?

Sullen Voice:
No. No noble would be this brazen. But...

Sullen Voice:
Your Majesty, I assure you, I will personally handle this affair, straight away. I'll...

Impassioned Voice:
Don't be flustered, my old friend. Alexandrina's long-time mentor accompanies her. I trust no one will pose a threat to her safety.

Sullen Voice:
Her mentor? As in...?

Impassioned Voice:
He treats Alexandrina very well. I can't recall if he's ever even shown me the same level of concern.

Impassioned Voice:
As for our Sighs of Kings, no matter where it is, it will play its role.

Sullen Voice:
You mean... the role of a Realmblade?

Impassioned Voice:
Hah. It'll be grasped by a righteous ruler before those academics conduct their endless research on it. <i>That</i> is what a Realmblade stands for.

Impassioned Voice:
And we all look forward to the coming of that day.

Sullen Voice:
......

Sullen Voice:
I understand.

Impassioned Voice:
Robert. For your daughter, and for mine.

Sullen Voice:
Yes, Your Majesty... and for Victoria.

Maid Ailshie:
Hold on, Miss, don't run so fast—

Allerdale:
I have to, Ailshie! I need to see my father!

Allerdale:
I know he's at home today! If I'm not quick enough, he'll be off God-knows-where again!

Maid Ailshie:
The Duke's been up to his ears in business recently, but if he knows you want to meet him, I'm sure he'd be willing to spend the time with you.

Allerdale:
I don't want him to spend time with me!

Maid Ailshie:
Then what are you in such a hurry to see him for?

Allerdale:
I... I need to tell him, loud and clear, how I don't want to go to County York.

Maid Ailshie:
Don't you like the country? The manor out there's a lot more land than it is here. You used to love playing in the meadow, and you always had the farmers' kids there play cricket with you.

Allerdale:
I love it there!

Allerdale:
But it's hardly even summer yet—this time of year, we usually stay in Londinium. Plus, isn't it strange to you how it's just me and Mum going this time?

Maid Ailshie:
Calm down for now. I hear from the Manchesters' butler how a lot of the noble houses' Masters and Mistresses are summering in the country early this year. It might just be one of those new trends in society, you know?

Allerdale:
Don't give me that.

Allerdale:
Ailshie, Dad's hiding from me. He wants me out of here. Why? Because I keep asking him to teach me swordsmanship, or because I can never get any Gaulish into my head? Is that why he has a temper at me?

Maid Ailshie:
Miss Allerdale, maybe it's not my place to say this, but...

Allerdale:
Well, my manners tutor isn't here right now, and I don't give two tosses what you should be saying or not.

Maid Ailshie:
...I can only offer my own opinion.

Maid Ailshie:
Miss, His Grace loves you very much. No matter what his decision is, it's going to be for the good of you and the Madam.

Allerdale:
If he wants good for me, that's more reason he shouldn't be sending me off.

Allerdale:
I... I'll miss him. I'll miss him a lot, you know.

Maid Ailshie:
Ha, ha... Oh, come on, you. What's the blushing for?

Allerdale:
Because that's the kind of thing only little kids say!

Allerdale:
I don't want Dad to think I'm attached to him! I need to be stronger, and then I can become a Steam Knight sooner, just like my great-great-great-great-grandmother—

Maid Ailshie:
But, you know, you <i>are</i> a child still.

Maid Ailshie:
You should try telling him everything you've been feeling. He's a gentle, generous Duke, and a kind and caring father. I'm sure he'll understand you.

Allerdale:
So you'll let me see him?

Maid Ailshie:
I always support you in your decisions.

Maid Ailshie:
But you'd best be a little slower, so's you don't trip on the plants, or else Mr. Jim the gardener'll skip dinner again out of shame for getting you hurt.

Allerdale:
Tell Jim it's his fault if his plants hurt me!

Maid Ailshie:
*sigh* Really, what do we do with you?

Maid Ailshie:
And make sure you mind your skirt, Miss Allerdale... You've got an audience with His Majesty at the dinner tonight!

Noble Gentleman:
Have you seen Charles Lynch anywhere?

Noble Lady:
The newly appointed Steam Knight, was it...? Incredible achievement at his age. I'm sure plenty came here just to mob him.

Noble Gentleman:
Shame he rushed off not long after he arrived. I hear every Steam Knight garrisoned in Londinium got orders to move.

Noble Lady:
...Is it Sargon or Leithanien this time?

Noble Lady:
God save Victoria, no more wars. Every time one happens, I have to sell off a few more of my grandfather's paintings, rest his soul.

Noble Gentleman:
It's an order direct from Parliament this time.

Noble Lady:
...Parliament?

Noble Lady:
Oh, of course... the Steam Knights sit under Parliament, don't they? You always get word so quick.

Noble Gentleman:
The more you're informed, the better you invest, especially in these times. This goes far further than how much pound sterling we make or lose.

Noble Gentleman:
We're deciding the nation's future, and that's precisely why we need to be in touch with more of the wisest.

Noble Gentleman:
Major Lynch is...

Noble Lady:
I think the proper title is Sir Charles now.

Noble Gentleman:
Sir Charles is a diligent and upstanding knight, loyal to our nation, to Victoria.

Noble Gentleman:
He's been aboard his high-speed warship defending us at the northern border for close to ten years, now. Countless meritorious deeds. Selected to be a Steam Knight, even at his young age. There's no telling how far he'll go.

Noble Lady:
I hear he used to live in Londinium, I think right here in Auchterigg? Come to think, I've never heard anything about his family.

Noble Gentleman:
No matter his family, he's a pillar of Victoria.

Noble Gentleman:
Those with the honor of joining the Steam Knights are much different stuff than in times past. You know the type, the court suck-up playing sycophant to the monarch.

Noble Lady:
Do I hear you ribbing at someone?

Noble Gentleman:
No, no, no, I would hardly. All I'm saying is, you see how His Majesty is surrounded by such fine company like Sir Charles, while there are people out there who've done nothing but rest their own laurels on their ancestry's honors. They're a pale shadow in—

Allerdale:
......

Noble Gentleman:
Oh, dear... whose child is this? What are you barging about a dining hall for? You'll be dragged off forthwith if you bother His Majesty or His Grace!

Noble Lady:
The dress... the hair color... Richard, she's...

Allerdale:
The Cumberlands are NOT suck-ups!

Allerdale:
We deserve steam armor! We'll charge enemy lines and give our lives for His Majesty and Victoria!

Maid Ailshie:
Miss Allerdale!

Maid Ailshie:
Sir Lord, Lady Martha, dreadfully sorry... the Miss is just feeling unwell right now, she doesn't mean to be rude to the guests. I should have put her to bed, the blame is mine.

Allerdale:
What do you mean the blame is yours, Ailshie?!

Allerdale:
No one is allowed to sully the Cumberlands' honor!

Allerdale:
I'll become a brilliant steam knight, like my ancestors were!

Allerdale:
Just wait until I grow up... I—I'll prove it to all of you!

Maid Ailshie:
Miss!

Allerdale:
......

Allerdale:
Excuse me.

Maid Ailshie:
*sigh* Don't run so fast!

Maid Ailshie:
Sir, Madam, I need to fetch Mistress Allerdale. If you'll pardon me.

Noble Lady:
Well, then. Our Miss Allerdale seems to be a fine, outspoken young girl.

Noble Gentleman:
Ah-heh... I thought we wouldn't have the chance to meet Miss Allerdale until the function tonight. How lucky of us, wouldn't you say, Martha?

Noble Gentleman:
Children can always afford to be innocent and naive. But whoever you may be...

Noble Gentleman:
You won't get away without growing up.

Allerdale pants and gasps as she runs down a long, long passage.

She meant to seek her father, and she has no idea why she squeezes her way into this tiny room instead. It's far from both the ballroom and the Duke's study, practically neighboring the attic.

It's probably her fit of temper in this moment. She doesn't understand why her dad wants her gone, let alone why those posh-dressed visitors would say such things about the Cumberlands.

Every time life doesn't go her way, like when she loses a cricket match, or when her father the Duke misses her birthday party, this is where she comes, so she can have a chat with her old friend.

Allerdale:
They've all forgotten! You were the mightiest knight the Steam Knights ever had!

Allerdale:
But my father taught me that true heroes aren't afraid to give their lives, and they're even less afraid of being forgotten... so I shouldn't have argued with them.

Allerdale:
I really want to grow up soon... and then I'll become one of the glorious Steam Knights too, and rout all our enemies!

Allerdale:
I'll make every single person who ever talked down on the Cumberlands too ashamed to lift their heads!

Allerdale:
I probably can't be as mighty as you were. But it'll be enough if I can just be half as... no... two-thirds as mighty.

Allerdale:
Oh, but my father's said that as a Cumberland, I must hold the loftiest goals in mind! So...

Allerdale:
You'll watch over me, can't you? I won't disappoint you, of course not!

Allerdale:
(...Is someone here?!)

Allerdale:
(Is it Ailshie?)

She doesn't want to be dragged back to the hall so soon, so she stoops down, and with a single step leaps behind the steam armor she knows so well.

The dilapidated suit shields her as if it was protecting the young desendant. Her dainty frame is completely concealed.

Strangers' footsteps encroach.

Most of her view is blocked by the suit; Allerdale can't make out their faces. The most she can glimpse is their distorted reflections.

Indistinct Officer:
Time's short, and chances are few. We need to confirm a few things.

Obscured Merchant:
Are you sure this place is safe?

Indistinct Officer:
It's as secluded as any nook or cranny gets. The rest of the visitors are all in the ballroom, still. No one's noticed us leave.

No, someone has.

Not everyone loves to hang around in opulent halls with nothing to do, Allerdale thinks to herself.

Obscured Merchant:
I don't understand. Why not choose today? The lion's finally left his den for once, and hardly any of the Guard are here.

Indistinct Officer:
An assassination can't solve anything, and it won't.

Obscured Merchant:
Don't tell me you're scared of the gallows, Mister Dutyman.

Indistinct Officer:
Compared to your fear of poverty, I'd say getting hanged's a lighter affair for me.

Obscured Merchant:
I'm SICK of spending my days with my brain and my wallet in others' hands. Chop-chop, please.

Indistinct Officer:
Even if the elder dies, there's still the cubs. The crown will remain seated firm on their heads, muzzling us like draft animals.

Obscured Merchant:
If we can kill one king, we can kill a second.

Indistinct Officer:
Easier said. Listen, we have to be patient.

Indistinct Officer:
The Steam Knights have all been sent out. By the time they return to Londinium, the dust will have settled.

Obscured Merchant:
What will they do then?

Indistinct Officer:
The same as those paragon few. They'll do nothing for their own gain, and everything for Victoria. Even if it won't be handy to support our actions, they'll understand the decisions from on high.

Obscured Merchant:
Then that leaves the Royal Guard.

Indistinct Officer:
At the parade...

Indistinct Officer:
...contain every Knight of the Tower... the key is seizing the city Defense Forces...

Indistinct Officer:
...some dukes got fed up with it long ago...

Allerdale's face presses against cold plate, but sweat nevertheless drips down her forehead.

It grows harder and harder not to move a muscle, not to mention keeping her breathing stifled. The voices of the two figures grow gradually out of reach, then suddenly are right before her.

For a blink, she quivers, trying as hard as she can not to let her body slip into view, curling even her toes in.

Obscured Merchant:
Has this lousy thing always been here?

Indistinct Officer:
First-generation steam knight armor.

Obscured Merchant:
First-generation! That's over two hundred years ago. It's antique by now, isn't it? I'm sure it'd fetch a pretty price.

Indistinct Officer:
Haven't you seen the family crest? It's House Cumberland's steam armor.

Indistinct Officer:
Its old owner once stood before the Gaulish artillery in this, braced for three whole hours, just so His Majesty could flee unscathed together with his shattered people.

Indistinct Officer:
Only during battlefield cleanup did people realize half this suit had been blown away, and the one inside may well have died soon after bombardment began—

Indistinct Officer:
—but even dead, knights still persevere in protecting their own king and kin, reluctant to fall so soon.

Obscured Merchant:
And here you're the one of Gaulish blood—I'm surprised you like reminiscing on these nobles' heroic deeds more than I do.

Indistinct Officer:
Fundamentally... I just bear respect for those we can call heroes.

Indistinct Officer:
Their belongings and your measuring of things don't mix. Even if this duke's home is razed to ash one day, the Cumberlands would never sell off this armor.

Obscured Merchant:
Hah... damned noble sense of honor, am I right? Utterly meaningless, in my view.

Obscured Merchant:
He's welcome to watch from his ivory tower all he likes, along with the rest of the dukes. No matter who the city's ruler nominally is, it won't make the dukes' authority any worse for wear, at least for the moment.

Indistinct Officer:
If he took the prudent path, then he wouldn't be Cumberland.

Indistinct Officer:
Why can't he just let go of his loyalty to the lions? With colossal change about to greet Victoria, you wish he'd recognize where his loyalty <i>should</i> lie, sooner rather than later.

Obscured Merchant:
What's going on down there?

Indistinct Officer:
More men than you can count have surrounded the Duke's manor.

Obscured Merchant:
What?!

Indistinct Officer:
Quiet. Listen carefully.

Victorian Officer:
Intruders... Palace underground...

Victorian Officer:
Blade... thieved...

Victorian Officer:
Seal off all major streets in Auchterigg... no one in or out...

Obscured Merchant:
Can you hear what they're saying down there?

Indistinct Officer:
They're searching for someone.

Obscured Merchant:
Who?

Indistinct Officer:
His Majesty's entire Guard has moved out.

Obscured Merchant:
They couldn't know we're meeting here... could they? What do we do, sir?

A faint noise comes from in front of them, a sound like someone gently drawing breath.

Allerdale's heart pounds.
