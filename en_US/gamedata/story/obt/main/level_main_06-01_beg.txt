The Year 937

Duke Erik and Professor Lierland D. of Piesberg Parliamentary University published this co-authored paper in The Journal of Urban History ('Where Did We Come From?' Issue 44).

The paper discussed the results of a detailed analysis of a collection of weathered remains.

The investigation into Sargon Excavation Site 4 revealed a common origin for Infected quarantines and executions with the law itself.

......

That is to say, the suffering of the Infected predates even the emergence of the law.

Lungmen, Support Structure Level, Exit

FrostNova:
Now, we must fight.

FrostNova:
If you can defeat me, it means some will be able to survive——

FrostNova:
I am willing to join Rhodes Island. I am willing to fight together with you against the enemies of the Infected, your way.

FrostNova:
This is my burden to bear.

'...Attention all citizens... are performing an evacuation exercise...'

'...Those citizens who have failed to evacuate, please lock your doors, draw your curtains, and do not leave your homes...'

???:
Does it have to be so loud?

???:
Shoot that drone down already!

Mephisto:
Now we're just caught up in an exercise? How dare they use such cheap tricks to cover up the exquisite terror I've worked so hard to formulate?

Mephisto:
And to repeat it over and over again in both Lungmen and Ursine tongues!

Mephisto:
I've had enough of these drones. Get! Hurry! Keep to the side streets!

Phantom Crossbowman:
Nothing from Scout Team 3 either!

Reunion Member:
Assault's signal suddenly c- cut out...

Reunion Member:
We're losing contact with all our overwatch teams one by one!

Mephisto:
Why! How!

Mephisto:
Such an insult... such humiliation foisted upon our movement!

Mephisto:
But how, and why? Damn you, Lungmen! Damn the Lungmenites! Damn the uninfected!

Phantom Crossbowman:
(I've never seen him so unstable like this.)

Phantom Crossbowman:
(Faust, do we still have a chance to retreat?)

Faust:
......

Faust:
(I'll make some space for you.)

Faust:
(If it's just your run-of-the-mill cops with the L. G. D. plus Rhodes Island, we should be able to get away.)

Phantom Crossbowman:
(What do you mean? Who else could be out there?)

Mephisto:
Agh...! I can't believe this! I can't get through!!

Mephisto:
If I can't even issue orders to my teams, how am I supposed to win?

Faust:
(Someone is watching us. There is still more to this city.)

Faust:
(Get ready. To survive.)

Phantom Crossbowman:
(Got it.)

Phantom Crossbowman:
(...Faust.)

Faust:
(Hm?)

Phantom Crossbowman:
(We trust you.)

Faust:
(......)

9:20 A.M. - Rhodes Island patrol route near the L. G. D.

Blaze:
They're really leaving this to the Infected? Rhodes Island got a raw deal this time.

Blaze:
And in Lungmen! Hmph. How could a city as big as Lungmen not have what it takes to fight off an invasion on its own?

Blaze:
Now they've got Infected fighting Infected on behalf of the normies...

Blaze:
Whatever. It's certainly not the first time.

Reunion Member:
Hurry up and clear a path! Don't look back, just break through their defenses!

Reunion Member:
If we can just get across this street, we have a shot at grouping up with the second brigade!

Reunion Member:
Don't give them a chance to return fire. There aren't many of us left——

???:
And in a moment, there won't be any of you left.

Reunion Member:
What?!

Reunion Member:
Wh... who are you? Did you just drop out of the sky?!

Reunion Member:
Get back, get out of here! She... she might be able to fly!

Blaze:
...I really can't!

Guard:
Identify yourself!

Blaze:
Use your scanner!

Blaze:
(Sorry, I have to deal with this first!)

Reunion Member:
Huh?

Blaze:
Lungmen law enforcement, listen up! I am from Rhodes Island.

Blaze:
Hold your fire. I really don't want to have to deal with crossfire while I'm fighting.

Blaze:
I can handle this on my own. You head on to the next roadblock.

Blaze:
Okay then. Back to you guys.

Reunion Member:
What's up with this chick?

Blaze:
I'll explain it to you. I'm sure you can figure it out. Probably.

Blaze:
(Deep breath)

Blaze:
I am Blaze, one of Rhodes Island's elite operators. My current objective is to cripple your combat capabilities.

Blaze:
The intentions with which you undertook this invasion of a foreign city-state notwithstanding, we aim chiefly to disarm you.

Blaze:
Setting aside the injuries and damages you have inflicted upon others, and attendant penalties, any attempt to resist at this point is pointless. Put down your weapons. You still have a chance.

Reunion Member:
Huh? What? You...

Blaze:
My fellow Infected, I give you a choice:

Blaze:
Surrender at once, and I will escort you to Rhodes Island, and subsequently deposit you somewhere welcoming to Infected.

Reunion Member:
She blocked it with her bare hands?!

Blaze:
Seeing as how you continue to resist, there's nothing more I can say.

Reunion Member:
As if we'd just let you lock us up? How crazy are you?

Blaze:
I'm not crazy! There's a time and a place for fight, and a time and a place for flight.

Blaze:
It's just that when you choose to fight, all I can do is fight back.

Blaze:
Either way, I don't need my chainsaw.

Blaze:
Sorry, I really don't want to fight my fellow Infected.

Blaze:
...it's so humid in Lungmen.

Reunion Member:
This stupid cat... is using Arts! Her body's steaming up!

Blaze:
My body? Guess again. Is it the air around me that's getting hot, or the air around you?

Blaze:
Let's take a Sami bath together. My treat.
