How many men have fallen before you?

Faust:
......

Reunion Member:
(Speaking Ursine).

Faust:
Of course. I will bring it back for you.

Reunion Member:
...... (Speaking Ursine)......?

Faust:
No. I'm not going to Chernobog.

Faust:
Rest.

Reunion Member:
......

Faust:
You'll be safe here.

Faust:
Get some rest.

How many men have fallen before me?

???:
Drop your weapon!

GreyThroat:
Just you...?

Faust:
......

GreyThroat:
Move and I shoot!

Faust:
Shoot first. Then ask questions.

GreyThroat:
What? He... disappeared?

GreyThroat:
No... I saw your file. You're Faust, one of their leaders. Your Arts won't fool me!

GreyThroat:
I know this is just an optical trick. If I shoot, you'll still have a bolt in your head.

Faust:
Wrong.

GreyThroat:
——!

Faust:
Can you predict my movements?

GreyThroat:
......

Faust:
The two of us, lone crossbowmen. If we both pull the trigger at the same time, we both die.

Faust:
What's your name?

GreyThroat:
Codename GreyThroat. When did you get behind me?

Faust:
The third time you blinked.

Faust:
You're pretty direct...

GreyThroat:
You've been separated from your squad. I'm not here to kill people who don't want a fight.

Faust:
We're enemies.

GreyThroat:
Rhodes Island is here to save the Infected. I saw you helping them.

Faust:
Those were my comrades. You're my enemy.

Faust:
When did Rhodes Island hire someone so naive?

GreyThroat:
Yes, I'm naive. All I can do is follow orders. I freeze up whenever I have to make a decision for myself.

Faust:
You need to be careful.

GreyThroat:
Watch your finger!

GreyThroat:
That's a single shot crossbow. If I dodge your bolt, you're dead. Don't pull that trigger.

Faust:
If you only follow orders, if you rely on everyone else to tell you what to do, that can only end poorly.

GreyThroat:
Why?

Faust:
Most of the sheep who blindly take orders aren't actually dependent on anyone. They just haven't started thinking for themselves...

Faust:
And those who have no direction in life, they're just empty machines looking for a sense of accomplishment, and meaning.

Faust:
You activate, and perform your function, you input a goal, you achieve your goal, until you consume everything around you, and you consume those you serve.

GreyThroat:
I won't.

Faust:
You're inexperienced.

GreyThroat:
I saw your interaction with the Infected back there. You're doing the right thing.

Faust:
Your opinion means nothing to me.

GreyThroat:
Faust, you've been avoiding the L. G. D. Even the ones who are out here on their own, you haven't shot at them. I've been watching you.

Faust:
Don't take my patience for weakness. If I ambushed you, you'd be dead.

GreyThroat:
But you didn't.

GreyThroat:
You're exhausted. Take it from a crossbowman, your string is drawn too tight. It's definitely going to snap.

Faust:
Take it from a crossbowman, you're too much.

GreyThroat:
You've also seen those... special Infected. We can figure this one out together.

Faust:
Maybe you're right.

GreyThroat:
Wait!

Faust:
But there's nothing I can do.

GreyThroat:
(He disappeared the instant he moved...? I can't figure his position!)

GreyThroat:
......

GreyThroat:
......hm?

GreyThroat:
Why haven't you killed me?

Faust:
You didn't shoot. Neither will I.

Faust:
But next time? If you don't kill me, I will kill you.

GreyThroat:
I don't want to hurt you!

Faust:
That's too bad.

Faust:
I guess you need someone to answer you. Without an answer, you can't understand.

Faust:
Don't worry about it. Killing, dying, these are everyday facts of life. Even for Rhodes Island.

GreyThroat:
Why can't we work together to save them?

Faust:
I really wish I could. But I know I can't.

Faust:
Don't follow me.

Faust:
You still don't know them. You don't yet have the whole picture.

Faust:
...and me? There's nothing I can do anymore.

How many men have fallen because of things I did? How many men have fallen because of things I didn't do?
