Chernobog - Operation Squad E0's Location

Dr. {@nickname} Rescue Operation, Phase 3

Medic:
Ah!

Medic:
This clinic...

Medic:
Amiya, haven't we been here before?

Amiya:
You're right...

Amiya:
But why has it... become like this?

Medic:
It's been totally abandoned... It looks it was attacked by Reunion.

Amiya:
...

Guard:
Wasn't this Azazel, the clinic for the Infected?

Amiya:
Yes...

Guard:
Even though they had access to Chernobog's entire underground intelligence network, they still refused to work with us...

Guard:
Back then, it wasn't clear what kind of dealings that had with Reunion...

Guard:
If only they had given us some information, or even just a hint...

Guard:
We could've been out of here by now.

Guard:
They brought this outcome upon themselves!

Amiya:
That's not the entire story...

Guard:
Amiya, you were there for the negotiations, weren't you?

Guard:
That cold and arrogant attitude of theirs really ticked me off...

Ace:
We can't blame them.

Guard:
Boss...

Ace:
It's hard for the Infected to trust anyone.

Ace:
After enduring so many hardships, who can blame them for becoming jaded and stubborn?

Amiya:
I can understand why they did what they did... and I can forgive them. Those who don't protect themselves are easily hurt by others.

Amiya:
Moreover, the Infected often can't even trust each other. Not everyone is able to stomach the kinds of risks that we take either...

Amiya:
Azazel... They were a black-market clinic that only provided services to the Infected.

Amiya:
Given the social status of the Infected, they couldn't openly reveal themselves in public.

Amiya:
Some of the Infected, not wanting to be thrown into quarantine, are hiding throughout the city, just trying to survive.

Amiya:
Azazel was aimed at providing services to these people.

Amiya:
...They must have rejected Reunion's proposals.

Amiya:
Doctor, I previously mentioned that we're all sick, right?

Amiya:
This disease will claim our lives, but it also grants us with extraordinary powers.

Amiya:
For example, I can use Originium Arts without the aid of a staff.

Amiya:
However, this disease does not only destroy our bodies...

Amiya:
It also destroys any chance we have at living a normal life. Or rather, 'civilized society' strips everything away from us.

Amiya:
Chernobog has been the shining beacon of this 'civility.'

Amiya:
Fearing, hating, exiling, and purging the Infected...

Nearl:
...

Nearl:
And, this is how it ends.

Amiya:
The only thing is, how many Infected were even given the option to choose between us, Reunion, or some other organization?

Amiya:
Most of them simply lost everything.

Amiya:
Perhaps, this clinic was a warm place that some of them could call home...

Amiya:
There is no cure for Oripathy. At least right now, the Infected can only die in despair.

Amiya:
And their bodies... become new sources of infection.

Amiya:
With their abnormal powers and fatally infectious disease...

Amiya:
The Infected... are the most hated people on this planet.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Doctor, you probably won't be able to understand everything just based upon my brief explanation.

Amiya:
But when you see the consequences of these problems with your own eyes... you will understand.

Amiya:
You'll see the harsh reality surrounding the Infected.

Dobermann:
Rhodes Island emphasizes equality for all, whereas Reunion is fanatically Infected-centric. However, organizations like ours are a rare sight.

Dobermann:
I can understand why you're angry, but it's hard not to sympathize with this little clinic.

Guard:
...I see.

Guard:
Perhaps they really ended up facing a bigger crisis than they could handle...

Dobermann:
In any case, we should leave our anger behind, along with this clinic.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island is filled with good people. Though fear and hostility might create rifts between people...

Amiya:
I believe that all misunderstandings will be resolved, as long as we're a part of the same family.

Amiya:
Perhaps... Rhodes Island is but another Azazel?

Guard:
Amiya...

Amiya:
Let's go, Doctor.
