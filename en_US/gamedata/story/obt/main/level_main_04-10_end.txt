Frostleaf:
*cough* *cough*...

Amiya:
Meteorite! We've managed to push the Yeti Squadron back!

Amiya:
But...

FrostNova:
I seem to have underestimated you, Rhodes Island.

FrostNova:
Perhaps I held back a bit too much.

Amiya:
(I can't feel my fingers anymore... Damn it...)

Amiya:
...What's going on...?

Amiya:
The cold current... is still gathering around her?

FrostNova:
This time...

FrostNova:
You won't be so lucky.

Amiya:
...? !

Amiya:
Oh no...!

Amiya:
Is she trying to absorb all the ice surrounding us and release it at once? !

FrostNova:
——♩——♬——

Amiya:
...She's going to drain all the heat from our bodies!

Amiya:
These Arts are on a complete different scale from what we saw before...!

FrostNova:
Let it all come to an end.

FrostNova:
May your anger be buried by purest frost.

Amiya:
...Nnngh...!

FrostNova:
...♩...

FrostNova:
...?!

FrostNova:
Something... is stopping the cold from gathering...

Frostleaf:
...Gah...

FrostNova:
Is this your doing?

Frostleaf:
Didn't I already tell you...

Frostleaf:
I won't let you... come any closer...!

FrostNova:
...Did you disrupt my cold current using your own Arts?

FrostNova:
...What a good kid.

Amiya:
Frostleaf used her blade to sever the cold current...!

Amiya:
But, but... she can't hold out long in that condition!

Amiya:
Her blade... it's about to break!

Meteorite:
...That's more than enough.

Meteorite:
This is our last chance!

Meteorite:
Amiya... now is the time!

Meteorite:
Cover me!

Amiya:
Be careful!

Meteorite:
Roger!

Amiya:
Starting firing - suppress Reunion's movements!

Amiya:
Meteorite, go!

Meteorite:
On my way...!

Reunion Member:
What?! The enemy is... rushing towards us?

Reunion Member:
No, she's... she's going straight towards FrostNova?!

Reunion Member:
As if we'd let you!

Reunion Member:
Fire!

Meteorite:
Agh...!

Amiya:
Meteorite!!

Meteorite:
Don't worry, it wasn't a direct hit!

Reunion Member:
She, she's still able to run?!

Reunion Member:
Damn it!

Reunion Member:
I told you! You'll never reach the Yetis!

Reunion Member:
Keep firing! Don't give her an opening!

Meteorite:
...Oh no!

Meteorite:
Gaah...!

Jessica:
Nooo!! She... she was hit... It can't be...

Meteorite:
...It's just a scratch! You'll have to do better than that if you want to stop me!!

Amiya:
More... I need to do more...

FrostNova:
*cough* *cough*...

Amiya:
...!

Amiya:
(The flow of the cold air... fluctuated for a moment?)

Amiya:
Wait... Where is that flow coming from...

Amiya:
--!

Amiya:
I know this feeling...!

Amiya:
Could it be...?!

Amiya:
I'll just have to give this a try!

Amiya:
I have to hit it...!

Amiya:
Everyone, believe in me!

Reunion Member:
...?

Reunion Member:
Rhodes Island's leader...

Reunion Member:
She shattered the Originium we planted with her Arts?

Reunion Member:
It's getting hazy...

Amiya:
I knew it! FrostNova created that cold current by planting Originium!

Amiya:
Meteorite!! Now's your chance!

Meteorite:
Frostleaf...

Meteorite:
I... I promise to save you!!

Meteorite:
So, wait for me...

Meteorite:
Please wait for me!

???:
Wake up!

Frostleaf:
Nnh...?

???:
I've got you!

Frostleaf:
Who...

???:
Up here! Quick! Hold on to me!

Frostleaf:
Meteo...rite?

Meteorite:
Who said you could play the hero?!

Meteorite:
Do you think I could just sit there and watch you die?

Frostleaf:
Put me down... I'm not... some pet...

Meteorite:
I won't let go of you!

Meteorite:
Amiya! Jessica!!

Jessica:
...All right!

Jessica:
Everyone, let's get out of here!

Amiya:
Meteorite, go ahead with Frostleaf. I'll cover your retreat!

Meteorite:
Understood!

Frostleaf:
...Gah...

Meteorite:
Haah... Haah...

Meteorite:
Frostleaf... hang in there...!

Meteorite:
Don't die... don't you dare die on me!!

Frostleaf:
Don't worry... you can't get rid of me that easily...

Meteorite:
Jeez, both you and Amiya too! Why do both of you have to be like this?!

Meteorite:
No matter how strong you might be... you're both just kids after all!

Frostleaf:
You're still treating me like a kid...?

Frostleaf:
...If I could save all of you by giving up my life, I think that's a pretty good deal.

Meteorite:
You... Mark my words! If you ever try to do something like this again...

Meteorite:
If you ever... I'd...

Frostleaf:
*sigh*... Sorry.

Frostleaf:
Start running, Meteorite.

Frostleaf:
Don't... look back...!

Amiya:
Hurry! Just go!!

Amiya:
Evacuate this area immediately! Protect the medics and the injured!

Amiya:
Snipers...! Aim at those effigies. Keep firing!!

Amiya:
Disrupt their formation! Demolish the entire building to cover our escape!

Amiya:
*cough* *cough*...

Amiya:
The explosions are making the haze thicker...!

Amiya:
Here's our opening! Get moving!!

Amiya:
Everyone, we're retreating from this square!!

FrostNova:
So... they got away.

FrostNova:
*cough*...

FrostNova:
*cough*...

FrostNova:
...

FrostNova:
How long have you been watching?

???:
Just a few minutes.

???:
These warriors are worthy of praise.

FrostNova:
Tch.

???:
Be careful.

???:
Your body isn't in very good condition.

FrostNova:
...I don't need you to remind me.

FrostNova:
Just do what you need to do, old timer.

FrostNova:
I'm going to go after Rhodes Island.

FrostNova:
We have to get rid of them first. Only then, will we be able...

FrostNova:
...to go to Lungmen.

???:
......

Amiya:
Phew...

Amiya:
Haah......

Amiya:
We're almost at the escape point.

Amiya:
Doctor, we...

Meteorite:
...Amiya!! We've finally gotten through to the L.G.D.!!

Meteorite:
It's an emergency communication!!

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en!!

Ch'en:
Listen... up...

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en? Can you hear me clearly?

Ch'en:
...Lungmen...

Amiya:
...What's going on?!

Ch'en:
...I'm safe now.

Ch'en:
But...

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
...Reunion took over one of our important facilities and is now forcefully opening a passage between the slums and the outer city.

Ch'en:
Amiya...

Ch'en:
Lungmen... is in danger.

............

Mephisto:
W managed to lure Lungmen and Rhodes Island right into our trap.

Mephisto:
That's right. They won't be able to escape. Faust and Crownslayer have already broken their defenses at one location.

Mephisto:
As you said, this will be our opening to flood into Lungmen.

Mephisto:
We will set up ambushes around every corner. The road to Lungmen will run red with fresh blood.

Mephisto:
Right, that old flag-waver should be coming back to Chernobog soon.

Mephisto:
Our victory is assured.

Mephisto:
Do you have any other orders for me, Talulah?

Talulah:
...

Talulah:
The time is upon us...

Talulah:
...to turn this rotten city into ashes.
