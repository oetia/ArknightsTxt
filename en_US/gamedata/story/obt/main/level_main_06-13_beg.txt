Ruins of Chernobog 'District 14'

Sector Surface

Reunion Caster:
What the hell?

Reunion Caster:
Yeti Squad, why have you stopped firing? What are you waiting for?

Yeti Squad Member A:
...Dig out those ruins, huh?

Reunion Caster:
Didn't you plant the Originium? Why not collapse the whole plate and wipe out Rhodes Island all at once?

Yeti Squad Member A:
Are you kidding? FrostNova is still down there!

Reunion Caster:
Then we'll deal with Rhodes Island. You guys keep digging. We'll be right there.

Yeti Squad Member A:
Not on this block! The superstructure in this sector is completely shredded. An untrained team fighting here could induce a total collapse!

Reunion Caster:
Wiping out Rhodes Island is a top priority. You take care of it.

Yeti Squad Member A:
I'm not gonna argue with you. We'll fight what we gotta fight. Who decided on this priority anyway?

Reunion Caster:
It's obviously our most important strategic goal.

Yeti Squad Member A:
Were you thinking about strategic goals when you vented your anger on the Ursus?

Yeti Squad Member A:
We'll do what we can. Give us some space.

Reunion Caster:
Did you... communicate with Rhodes Island?

Reunion Caster:
You're betraying the Movement!

Yeti Squad Member A:
......

Blaze:
(What's going on over there?)

Yeti Squad Member A:
(I think we have to fight.)

Yeti Squad Member A:
If you think communication is tantamount to betrayal then that's your prerogative.

Yeti Squad Member A:
With that kind of tactical thinking, it's no wonder you're getting led around by the nose.

Reunion Caster:
...Yetis! What are you up to?!

Reunion Caster:
We outnumber you a hundred times over, don't be stupid!

Yeti Squad Member A:
...Come on, we fought the Ursus Standing Army like a million times, who's getting excited over a big angry mob?

Reunion Caster:
Just you wait!

Yeti Squad Member A:
(Static)

Yeti Squad Member A:
Hey, Rhodes Island. We might have to teach those unruly bastards a lesson.

Yeti Squad Member A:
You should probably stay out of it. We don't want to be accused of collaborating with the enemy.

Blaze:
Huh? Collaborating? What are you talking about?

Blaze:
Amiya, what happened in the ruins, and what's the official party line on it?

Amiya:
......Nothing happened. We were fighting Yeti Squad and no other Reunion units joined the battle.

Blaze:
Acting? I'm a phenomenal actress.

Blaze:
What do you say we put on a show and then take care of these guys in the ensuing chaos?

Yeti Squad Member A:
Sounds good to me. What does your captain think?

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
Excuse me, sir. How should I call you?

Yeti Squad Member A:
...Um, well, you're a really cute girl, but I'm not sure I'm ready for anything like that...

Yeti Squad Member B:
Ready for what? What are you thinking?!

Yeti Squad Member A:
Oh, sorry. I'm just playing around. You can call me Yeti #1, I guess.

Amiya:
All right, Mr. Yeti #1... We've got lives to save, don't we?

Amiya:
So let's subdue the Reunion units that could interfere with our rescue mission.

Mr. Yeti #1:
Yeah. I'm plenty motivated now.

Blaze:
...And where exactly did you get that motivation?
