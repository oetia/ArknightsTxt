Desert by Lungmen \ Facility #14

Meteorite:
...I've reached the destination.

Meteorite:
No other abnormalities found.

Meteorite:
Report complete.

Meteorite:
Frostleaf, why were you frowning the whole way here?

Frostleaf:
I'm just a little concerned about Amiya's group.

Meteorite:
They've already safely returned to Rhodes Island.

Meteorite:
Nearl and Dobermann already left Lungmen a week ago for their next assignment.

Meteorite:
It must be a pretty tough mission if it required sending those two together.

Meteorite:
Blacksteel and Penguin Logistics both have their own matters to attend to.

Jessica:
Oh, Liskarm and Franka...

Jessica:
I'm... I'm glad that they're safe...

Meteorite:
You've got to work hard as well, just like them.

Meteorite:
When Franka sent you over to me, she spoke very highly of you.

Jessica:
R-really...?

Meteorite:
If only you weren't so timid, she said.

Jessica:
Uuu....

Meteorite:
...Hey, don't act like you're about to start crying!

Meteorite:
Aren't you also a member of Blacksteel...?

Jessica:
I, I'm not... crying...

Meteorite:
...

Meteorite:
...In any case, let's continue our mission.

Meteorite:
Our next task is to work with the other recon teams to scout out this entire city.

Meteorite:
Other than searching for survivors, we also need to assess the situation.

Meteorite:
If we encounter hostile Infected, we'll have to deal with the threat quickly.

Meteorite:
Even though our mission isn't particularly dangerous, it's still best to proceed with caution.

Meteorite:
In the event that Reunion is involved in this, we'll retreat immediately and report back to Dr. Kal'tsit.

Jessica:
Mmhm, mmhm!

Frostleaf:
Understood.

Meteorite:
All that's left for us to do... is to focus on our job.

Rhodes Island

Deserted Mobile City - 2 days after the discovery of 'Facility #14'

Amiya:
Ah... You made it, Doctor.

Texas:
Good timing, Dr. {@nickname}.

Exusiai:
Our job here is about done. You probably won't see us for a while~

Liskarm:
We'll see you soon enough.

Franka:
It won't be long before we're back on standby in Rhodes Island.

Franka:
Don't miss me too much.

Exusiai:
Well, unfortunately, we don't have such an official-sounding reason. Right, Texas?

Texas:
Hold on a second...

Exusiai:
Penguin Logistics... is about to go on vacation!

Exusiai:
It's only going to one precious day... But still--

Texas:
...Apologies. This isn't the best time to talk about it.

Amiya:
Don't worry... Everyone needs to get some rest.

Texas:
...I should be the one saying that to you.

Amiya:
Huh...?

Exusiai:
That's right, that's right. Amiya, girl, you really need a bit of R&R!

Amiya:
There are many things in Rhodes Island that must be taken care of...

Liskarm:
I can understand that, but make sure not to give yourself too much pressure, Amiya.

Franka:
No matter how strong your will is, your body won't be able to keep up if you get exhausted.

Franka:
You'd better not get sick. Everyone's counting on you!

Amiya:
I... Everyone has always been looking after me.

Texas:
We were also inspired by the way you fight.

Texas:
Just that much is enough.

Exusiai:
Since I'm already here, I'll take this opportunity to get a free check-up before heading back.

Franka:
Our work here is about done anyway. Next up is...

Franka:
Amiya, Dr. {@nickname}.

Amiya:
I'm listening.

Franka & Exusiai:
...

Franka & Exusiai:
Keep up the good work~! Cheer up!

Amiya:
Wha... huh?

Liskarm:
After we finish our report, we'll be right back.

Texas:
No matter what, life must move forward.

Texas:
Amiya, take care.

Amiya:
Everyone... I...

Amiya:
...I will. You all take care as well.

Amiya:
See you next time.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Doctor,

Amiya:
I have to visit the slums in outer Lungmen again. I should be of assistance.

Amiya:
Don't worry, Doctor.

Amiya:
Another member of Rhodes Island, Projekt Red, will be joining me in Lungmen.

Amiya:
She's really good!

Amiya:
With her there, you don't have to worry about me.
