Infected Patrol Unit:
Ngh...

Talulah:
I didn't cut off your hands! Pick yourself up!

Infected Patrol Unit:
...Don't you dare think this is over!

Talulah:
I'll cut out your tongue right here, then.

Infected Patrol Unit:
Eek!

Talulah:
...Off he goes.

Talulah:
Are you okaâ€”

Old Man:
What have you done! Oh, God, Talulah... Look at what you've done!

Old Man:
Talulah, we'll have to transport the village in two days. Just look at what you've...!

Old Man:
You fought a patrolman! There'll be hell to pay now!

Talulah:
Letting him beat you was even less of an idea. It's getting late, and he's on the run. If I kill him now, we'll be long gone by the time the others find his remains.

Talulah:
But that wouldn't solve any of our problems. Once the patrol unit regroups, they'd still come looking for us. They might well be out to get revenge on us.

Old Man:
And yet you did it! Now what do we do!?

Talulah:
Calm down. They're looking for Infected. They still don't know.

Old Man:
......

Old Man:
Don't know what?

Talulah:
They don't know what I'm about to do.

Old Man:
Hey... Talulah!

Talulah:
It's okay. Come on, I'll walk you back.

Talulah:
Your leg there... It will need special attention to heal.

Old Man:
Hah. So today's the day you start helping me walk? Always thought I was still in good shape myself. Who'd've guessed I couldn't outrun it?

Old Man:
Talulah, there's something I need to tell you.

Talulah:
What is it?

Old Man:
......

Old Man:
Ah, good question. Heh, hahah, sorry, I don't remember. Look at me now. Look at my memory...

Talulah:
......

Talulah:
That's some impressive forgetfulness, alright.
