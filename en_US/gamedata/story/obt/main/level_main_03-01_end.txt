L.G.D. Agent:
Madam...

Ch'en:
Speak.

L.G.D. Agent:
Most of Reunion's forces have retreated already.

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en, we're also done here.

Ch'en:
Tsk...

Ch'en:
About those Reunion suspects that we rounded up a few days ago...

Ch'en:
Have we been able to get any information out of them?

Reunion Suspect:
...

L.G.D. Agent:
Does this crossbow look familiar to you?

Reunion Suspect:
...

L.G.D. Agent:
You're able to draw it, aren't you?

L.G.D. Agent:
What's the structure of the ammunition? How does it work?

L.G.D. Agent:
What were you doing in the slums?

L.G.D. Agent:
What were you doing in Lungmen?

Reunion Suspect:
...

L.G.D. Agent:
...Nothing.

L.G.D. Agent:
They won't say a word.

L.G.D. Agent:
Or perhaps... they just don't know anything.

L.G.D. Agent:
Like the other Reunion members we defeated, they're probably nothing more than obedient puppets.

Ch'en:
...Make them speak.

Ch'en:
Use any methods necessary.

Ch'en:
I want to know about their squads, their leadership, their strategies, where they're from, and what they plan to do...

Ch'en:
Get everything out of them that you can.

Ch'en:
I want everything I can get.

Ch'en:
Report back to me right away, no matter how insignificant it might seem.

L.G.D. Agent:
Roger!

Amiya:
Has the L.G.D. ever arrested Reunion members before?

Ch'en:
We can't say for sure.

Ch'en:
In the end, it's just speculation.

Ch'en:
Get me in touch with Hoshiguma!

Ch'en:
How's the Special Operations Division faring?

Ch'en:
Are they still being overwhelmed by a single Infected?

L.G.D. Agent:
Reunion seems to have pulled back on their end as well.

L.G.D. Agent:
Inspector Hoshiguma is worried about a possible trap and is trying to rule out all risks...

Ch'en:
Hmph... Just a single person...

Ch'en:
Who the hell do they think they are, coming and going like that?!

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
You should already know what your next mission is going to be, Amiya.

Amiya:
We're going to get Misha back?

Ch'en:
Correct.

Ch'en:
This will be the joint operation.

Ch'en:
The L.G.D. will take the lead, while Rhodes Island will be in charge of recon and the assault.

Ch'en:
Your mission is complete as long as you can stall Reunion's retreat.

Amiya:
Understood.

Franka:
If we're looking for the enemy... won't we also risk being discovered?

Franka:
Right now, we also don't have enough support for our recon squad...

Franka:
We can't do this on our own.

Amiya:
We should leave this to the professionals.

Amiya:
Franka, help me get in touch with Penguin Logistics.

Amiya:
We're going to need another favor from Exusiai and Texas.
