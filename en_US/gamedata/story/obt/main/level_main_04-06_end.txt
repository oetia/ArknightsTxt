Amiya:
We've defeated Reunion's forces!

Hoshiguma:
Bah. For a bunch of roadblocks, these guys were a bit tough.

Hoshiguma:
...

Hoshiguma:
There's no sign of Ch'en.

Amiya:
We're in a real mess now...

Hoshiguma:
She's not responding to my calls either! Tsk... This part of her hasn't ever changed.

Hoshiguma:
L.G.D.! All members, prepare to follow me--

Amiya:
No, Inspector Hoshiguma.

Amiya:
You should let us handle it.

Amiya:
We're approaching the Originium-dense zones left by the Catastrophe...

Amiya:
If you go any further, the healthy risk being infected by Oripathy.

Amiya:
These consequences are too dire.

Amiya:
Furthermore, as Infected...

Hoshiguma:
Hah. Given your small stature, it's cute when you try to give serious speeches.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Eh? Huh?!

Hoshiguma:
Hahaha, I was just giving you a hard time.

Hoshiguma:
But you don't have to persuade me. I understand your concern.

Hoshiguma:
L.G.D.! We will be Rhodes Island's shield!

Hoshiguma:
Block the entrance, and don't let a single Reunion member enter or exit!

Hoshiguma:
We'll let the experts handle this problem!

Amiya:
Inspector...

Hoshiguma:
Oh, just call me Hoshiguma.

Hoshiguma:
Go. Please take care of Ch'en.

Hoshiguma:
Make sure you bring her back with you in one piece.

Amiya:
I will, Hoshiguma...! I swear I'll bring Madam Ch'en back safely...!

Hoshiguma:
Make sure to stay safe yourselves.

Amiya:
Okay!

Amiya:
Doctor, please follow me.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island, let's go!

Amiya:
(Wait for me, Madam Ch'en...)

Amiya:
(Frostleaf, Meteorite, Jessica...)

Amiya:
(You have to stay strong!)

Medic:
We've retrieved the recon team that we were last in contact with.

Medic:
It's... looking really bad...

Kal'tsit:
...

Kal'tsit:
Rubor, hypothermia, and necrosis...

Kal'tsit:
What's going on here?

Wounded Operator:
Ngh...

Kal'tsit:
Completely frostbitten...?
