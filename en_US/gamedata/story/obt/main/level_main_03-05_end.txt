Amiya:
Fall back! Everyone, regroup!

Amiya:
Let them go!

Amiya:
The enemy is going to cut off our squads at this rate!

Amiya:
We can't afford to let that happen, in case more reinforcements show up...

Amiya:
These Reunion forces... are not targeting us!

Amiya:
Our top priority is to keep our operators safe!

Amiya:
Snipers, stop attacking the fleeing Reunion forces!

Amiya:
Focus on helping Madam Hoshiguma first!

Hoshiguma:
So annoying!

W:
Not bad, not bad. You actually managed to soak up all my attacks~

W:
But, how much more can you take?

Hoshiguma:
That depends on how long you can survive!

Hoshiguma:
---Ch'en! Hurry up!

Ch'en:
Surround that woman!

W:
Ohhh, did L.G.D. come to play?

Ch'en:
Lower your weapons!

W:
We meet again, Madam~

Ch'en:
You won't talk your way out of this.

Ch'en:
All that you've done to Lungmen... I'll do to you twice over.

W:
Oh my, how scary~

W:
But I'm not here to play with you today.

W:
Amiya, catch~

Amiya:
Me? This is... some kind of phone?

W:
That's right. Someone wants to talk to you~

Amiya:
...?!

W:
Anyway, that concludes my mission.

W:
Before I forget, I have something for you as well, Madam.

W:
See you later~

Ch'en:
Watch out!

Amiya:
...A short-range bomb...?!

Amiya:
No, it's a flashbang!

Amiya:
Don't let her trick you...

Ch'en:
...It's too late.

Ch'en:
She already got away.

Ch'en:
She sure got out of there fast. All she needed was a momentary distraction to slip through our defenses.

Ch'en:
Also, you should be careful of that thing you're holding. If it's another bomb...

Amiya:
This... seems like a regular cellphone...

Amiya:
Except... could it be...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Hello?

————

Misha:
Is that...

Misha:
Amiya...?

Amiya:
Misha! Tell me, where are you?! I'm...

Misha:
Amiya...

Misha:
...

Girl's Voice:
...Prioritize... treating the heavily injured!! We need a blood transfusion here!! Hurry!!

Young Man's Voice:
...Damn it... Why... Even though we're all Infected...

Young Man's Voice:
Rhodes Island... why would they do this to us...?!

Girl's Voice:
...We were always abandoned from the very beginning!! We have no escape... nothing at all...!

Boy's Voice:
Don't die! Don't leave me!! We promised... We promised to go home together...!

Girl's Voice:
*sobbing*... Brother... please don't...

Misha:
Do you hear their voices...?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Reunion's... Infected?

Misha:
I remember now.

Misha:
No, I never forgot. I just... didn't want to remember...

Misha:
That's right. It was Reunion that destroyed my home. My father also...

Misha:
But... we brought it upon ourselves.

Misha:
That year, I watched my younger brother, dragged away before my own eyes... He called out for me, crying my name, but I turned away...

Misha:
...and hid inside my room.

Misha:
When he found me again... He had sacrificed so many things.

Misha:
Even though he still loved me, I was afraid, and I ran away...

Misha:
But I now understand.

Misha:
Everything that he has done... was just to give the oppressors a taste of the suffering that the Infected go through every day.

Misha:
And now, I am one of them.

Misha:
...It is time for me to atone for my sins.

Amiya:
Misha, don't be rash!

Amiya:
No matter how you treated the Infected in the past, you can always change--

Misha:
It's no use.

Misha:
What can I change?

Misha:
Because I... was one of those who turned a blind eye...

Misha:
After becoming an Infected, I finally... can see it clearly.

Misha:
The way normal people treated the Infected... is how the Infected would treat normal people.

Misha:
Because they deserve it.

Amiya:
No...

Misha:
All of this... Is nothing more than the weeds of evil that have sprouted from the seeds of cruelty I planted...

Misha:
This torment is my karmic justice.

Misha:
But, why... Why?

Misha:
Why did that happen to him, even though he had done nothing wrong?!

Misha:
All he was guilty of was suddenly coming down with the infection...

Misha:
He was so young... He had only started asking for me to help with his homework!

Misha:
If only I... If only I had protected him back then...

Amiya:
Misha! Please calm down!

Amiya:
You didn't hurt any innocents! None of this was your fault!

Misha:
From the very beginning, who's innocent?!

Amiya:
...

Misha:
The only thing that's wrong... is this label that the Infected have been given...

Misha:
If this is a cycle of revenge against each other... Then tell me, who was the one who set this tragedy in motion...?!

Misha:
If Ursus had never treated the Infected like monsters...

Misha:
...then what reason would anyone have to hate Ursus so much?!

Misha:
Who ordained that the Infected must suffer like this?!

Amiya:
Misha...

Amiya:
Skullshatterer is dead. You can come back to us now. I promise, we'll...

Misha:
...

Misha:
Amiya... I've already found my answer...

Misha:
I am an Infected.

Misha:
I stand on the side of the Infected.

Amiya:
Don't...

Misha:
That's right, Amiya. You're also an Infected...

Misha:
So you should be able to understand.

Amiya:
That's right. I'm just like you... just like everyone in Rhodes Island. We all understand how you feel...

Amiya:
But, Misha, even if you accept your identity, that won't change who you are!

Amiya:
Please wait for me! I'm coming to find you!

Misha:
Don't come.

Amiya:
...Misha! Where are you--

Misha:
You're right, Amiya. You're absolutely right... I was just feeling guilty. Guilty... because I was too weak.

Misha:
But I've made up my mind.

Misha:
Even if it's only a single step... it is a step that I must take.

Misha:
I'm sorry, Amiya. I'm so sorry...

Misha:
To be an Infected... is to be a part of Reunion.

Misha:
That is all we are, after all...

Misha:
Goodbye...

Amiya:
Misha? Misha?! Misha!!

Amiya:
...
