Waaahhh...

I'm hungry!

Where's daddy? Where did he go?

I want my daddy...! Daddy! Daddyyy!

Daddy will come get me!

GreyThroat:
......!

GreyThroat:
A child?

GreyThroat:
Blaze-4, Amiya-1, come in. I'm in the slums. 4th Street, building number 10. There's a child survivor, Infected.

Child:
Waaahhh...

GreyThroat:
...Hello.

Child:
Wh- who are you?

Child:
Are you a Lungmenite?

GreyThroat:
I will not hurt you. I don't speak Ursine well. I am not an enemy.

Child:
What did you say?

GreyThroat:
Come with me. It is dangerous here.

Child:
I can't... Uncle said to stay here.

GreyThroat:
But I will take you to find your dad.

Child:
You can do that?

GreyThroat:
I can do that.

GreyThroat:
You, hiding behind me, come out.

Reunion Member:
You're...

Reunion Member:
You're not with them.

Reunion Member:
You're... from Rhodes Island?

GreyThroat:
Child, stay back. Don't come closer.

GreyThroat:
Drop your weapon and come out with your hands up.

Reunion Member:
What?

Reunion Member:
You're not here to save us?

Reunion Member:
Don't you Rhodes Islanders know what's hidden here?

Reunion Member:
We worked hard to set up this ambush... If we can't lure them in, if we can't take them out, they'll kill all of us!

GreyThroat:
You're using children as bait. You deserve to be killed.

Reunion Member:
You think this will end when we're dead?

Reunion Member:
Even if they kill us, they won't let the children go. They won't let anyone go!

Reunion Member:
If that's all it took, we'd gladly die to save the kids!

Reunion Member:
We didn't even attack you!

GreyThroat:
Who's killing children...? The people in the black raincoats?

Reunion Member:
You've seen them, you understand! They're slaughtering everyone!

GreyThroat:
That's no excuse. After I take you in, I will apply to have you protected.

Reunion Member:
And we're supposed to just trust you? That crossbow of yours is a killing tool, what are you protecting?

GreyThroat:
For now, I'm protecting your lives.

Reunion Member:
Save it. We'll deal with you, then reset our trap!

Reunion Member:
We've already got the order to form up and retreat. If we die here, it would dishonor those comrades who died to save their children!

GreyThroat:
...Child, take cover!

GreyThroat:
Hm...

GreyThroat:
I'm still alive?

???:
You think you'd be better off dead?

GreyThroat:
Operator Blaze?

Blaze:
It's not like you dying would solve anything. Better keep on ticking.

GreyThroat:
What about... the Reunion men? And the children?

Blaze:
......

Blaze:
Operator GreyThroat, I got you all wrong. And I'm sorry.

GreyThroat:
The children!

Blaze:
I took care of the Reunion guys! I hid the kids! Just listen to me already!

GreyThroat:
No need... as long as the children are safe.

Blaze:
Can you not be obnoxious for like five minutes?

GreyThroat:
What did you get wrong about me?

Blaze:
I watched you stand up to fight for Infected kids. It was hella leng noi.

GreyThroat:
Your Lungmen dialect sucks.

Blaze:
Hey, that's off the top of my head! But really, I thought you were just some heartless uninfected girl, joining Rhodes Island to spy on us or whatever. I got you all wrong.

GreyThroat:
If I were a spy, this is how I'd get you to trust me. As long as you weren't stupid enough to let me bleed out...

GreyThroat:
You bandaged me?

Blaze:
I'm still an elite operator. It's my job.

Blaze:
Anyway, you're right.

Blaze:
But even if you were a spy, you still did the right thing. So I'll save this spy's life and then pack her off to Legal.

GreyThroat:
I could just run.

Blaze:
Let's not be stupid here. How are you gonna outrun me?

Blaze:
Trust doesn't mean letting your guard down. Trust means knowing what you'll do and what you won't.

Blaze:
If you do the right thing, I'll back you up. If you do the wrong thing, I'll correct it, or stop it, if I have to. That's trust.

Blaze:
Thanks, GreyThroat. You trusted me, and you corrected my wrong thoughts with your right actions.

Blaze:
And I'm sorry.

GreyThroat:
......

Blaze:
But you really need to work on your people skills. They didn't want to be difficult, that was a show for survival.

Blaze:
If you screw up, you still need to go to Legal.

GreyThroat:
Whatever.

Amiya:
I think so... at least Blaze is trying. Leave it to her to drop her prejudices so quickly.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island's elite operators have more than just their incredible combat skills. Blaze is also gifted with a gregarious personality and savoir faire. As well as her own opinions.

Amiya:
If you want to lead her, if you want her support, you'll have to gain her trust. And first, you have to learn how.

Amiya:
I've fought alongside Blaze for a long time. And I think... I think you can too, Doctor.

Amiya:
But okay... isn't good enough, is it?

Amiya:
She puts up a carefree front, but Blaze has a complicated personality.

Amiya:
Give it time, keep your eyes open, and I know you can do it, Dr. {@nickname}.

Amiya:
But you need to put in more work!

Amiya:
Learning to trust each other isn't easy, but it needs to be done.

Amiya:
We need your power, Doctor, and you need to win over the operators to turn those tactics of yours into reality.

Amiya:
That's a lengthy process, but it's one you need to experience.

Amiya:
Blaze is an elite operator who excels in assault operations. She doesn't have much to offer in the way of strategic thinking.

Amiya:
She really needs your support. Or you could think of it like she'll turn your strategies into reality on the battlefield. She's a professional.

Amiya:
I'd say she's already cooperating.

Amiya:
Like, look where we are now...

Amiya:
Our operators follow our orders out of a sense of duty, not trust.

Amiya:
Real trust is built on understanding. The kind Blaze is working on with GreyThroat.

Amiya:
Oh...

Amiya:
Looks like we've got company. More Reunion.

Amiya:
Let's give Blaze a little more room to apologize. She still needs to stick her foot in her mouth a few more times.

Amiya:
Yep.

Amiya:
She's a good conversationalist, but not so great at expressing her feelings.

Amiya:
What's really going on here is her confronting her deep-seated prejudices more than just an apology to GreyThroat.

Amiya:
Normal folks' prejudices against the Infected aren't a one way street... we have our own issues with the uninfected.

Amiya:
The enemy within is just as much an enemy as the enemy without.

Amiya:
...We will.

Amiya:
Listen up.

Amiya:
Those Reunion guys were scared out of their wits.

Amiya:
Neither we nor the L. G. D. can put that kind of fear into someone. They were ready to go against everything they stood for.

Amiya:
They met something else... But what was it out there that could do that to them?

Amiya:
And... will we have to fight them too?
