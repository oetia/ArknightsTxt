Dobermann:
Ace!

Ace:
Looks like you all made it out alive.

Dobermann:
This isn't the rendezvous point... Why are you here alone?

Reunion Member:
They're the ones who escaped from the central area! Don't let them get away!

Dobermann:
Tsk, they just keep coming after us!

Dobermann:
Team E2, prepare to intercept--

Ace:
Dobermann, don't get overzealous. Retreating is our top priority!

Ace:
Amiya, Dr. {@nickname}! Quick!

Dobermann:
It's not safe here either.

Ace:
That's right. We still have to press on to the next rendezvous point.

Dobermann:
Where's your team?

Reunion Member:
Where are you rats hiding? Smoke them out!

Dobermann:
Here they come again!

Ace:
Dr. {@nickname}, please give us your orders.

Ace:
Just like the good ol' days.

Amiya:
Um, Ace...

Amiya:
Actually, something unexpected has happened.

Amiya:
Doctor... is suffering from amnesia.

Ace:
...I see.

Amiya:
I'm sorry, Ace... But compared to before, a lot has changed.

Ace:
Is that so? You don't need to apologize to me.

Ace:
Have the Doctor's commanding capabilities suffered as a result of the amnesia?

Amiya:
...As sharp as before.

Amiya:
Doctor's decisionmaking is still absolutely reliable. I can promise you this.

Ace:
Very well then. I'll follow the Doctor's orders then.

Ace:
What has been lost can be found again.

Ace:
Right now, there's a more imminent problem on our hands.

Reunion Member:
They're over here! Hurry, let's get them! !

Dobermann:
Are you done chatting yet? I'm going to go crack some skulls!

Ace:
Dr. {@nickname}, please give us your orders.

Reunion Member:
Go. Release your inner beast, and let them feel your fangs!

Dobermann:
Doctor! Ace! The enemy is right in front of us!

Ace:
——

Ace:
Understood.

Ace:
Team E3! Back up Dobermann!

Reunion Member:
An ambush?!

Dobermann:
Team E3 has been moving undercover this whole time... I see, they've been waiting for us to pincer the enemy.

Ace:
When communications are jammed, our teams should operate near the rendezvous point. That way, even if something happens to me or the scout...

Ace:
The broader operation can still be carried out. This is my decision-making.

Dobermann:
In other words, Ace, you left your team back at the rendezvous point and came here alone...

Ace:
After all, neutralizing threats around the rendezvous point is our top objective.

Ace:
Of course, prioritizing checking on your status is a big risk. There's no way I could imperil the entire team.

Ace:
The whole reason teams exist is to increase tactical efficiency, not the other way around.

Dobermann:
Hah. Let's continue our discussion after we've taken care of Reunion!

Ace:
Amiya, you're up.

Amiya:
Understood! I'll back you up with my Arts!

Ace:
Finally...

Ace:
Dr. {@nickname}, please command Rhodes Island.
