Frostleaf:
*gasp*... Damn it...

Jessica:
We finally... got them...

Meteorite:
...

Meteorite:
...No, not yet.

Jessica:
What's that powder drifting down...?

Reunion Member:
Nngh... Guhh...

Reunion Member:
Uaaagh!

Reunion Member:
It hurts... It huuurrtsssss...

Reunion Member:
Aaagh... Aaaargh! It itches! It itches!!

Reunion Member:
Graaah?!!

Reunion Member:
Rhodes... Rhodes Island!

Reunion Member:
Enemy... Enemy!!

Jessica:
What...! Wh-what's going on...

Jessica:
The enemies we just defeated are standing back up...?

Mephisto:
What? Are you done already?

Frostleaf:
There's a glow... coming from that guy's staff...?

Mephisto:
I haven't even done anything yet.

Jessica:
And... they've got a lot more reinforcements coming...

Meteorite:
Curse you...!

Meteorite:
Right now, I can only pray that this round can kill the enemy leader...!

Frostleaf:
Don't.

Mephisto:
Haha... Do you really have time for a strategy meeting in your position?

Mephisto:
So much self-confidence.

Meteorite:
Hmph. I'll teach you a lesson with this shot...

Frostleaf:
No, Meteorite. Don't.

Meteorite:
Tsk...! Why?!

Frostleaf:
We need to retreat.

Frostleaf:
I can feel it...

Frostleaf:
It's them. They're here.

Mephisto:
Ohh? You're not going to shoot?

Mephisto:
What a pity.

Mephisto:
You know, you won't get another chance.

Meteorite:
Is he leaving? But--

Frostleaf:
Meteorite! Aim at that collapsing building to the west, now! At least we can distract the enemy to buy us some time!

Meteorite:
...This is our only option! I'll do it!

Frostleaf:
Jessica, start running.

Jessica:
Huh?

Frostleaf:
...The Yetis are here.

Jessica:
Wait...

Jessica:
S-so cold...

Frostleaf:
... ...Let's go.

Frostleaf:
Now.

Meteorite:
...Jessica.

Meteorite:
She's right.

Meteorite:
We need to get out of here...!

Frostleaf:
Amiya, can you hear me?

Frostleaf:
Hello? Hello?

Meteorite:
Just go! I'll cover you!

Frostleaf:
Listen, Amiya.

Frostleaf:
...Do not come.

Frostleaf:
These ruins are...
