Amiya:
Runner Three, down!

Rosmontis:
Runner Seven, destroyed!

Kal'tsit:
Runner Eight, intercepted.

Kal'tsit:
Raidian, execute the feint! Use your Arts to extend or hit their nervous systems directly!

Kal'tsit:
Pull all the enemies!

Amiya:
*Pant* *pant*... so tough. Is everyone okay?

Rhodes Island Operator:
No problems yet... But... it's really intense. I've never seen combat on this scale before...

Rhodes Island Operator:
I'm due for a vacation if I make it back from this.

Amiya:
Right. I'll approve it.

Amiya:
But first... let's knock out this team! Then if you want a raise, a vacation, a specific assignment, I'll grant anything!

Guerrilla Fighter:
Incoming!

Guerrilla Fighter:
Don't get distracted! Back in formation!

Guerrilla Fighter:
A major firefight by the east exit? Stay calm, push ahead slow. Don't give them an opening!

Guerrilla Fighter:
These don't look like Ursus or Yan tactics. What's going on? Who are they?

Guerrilla Fighter:
After picking off Ursus soldiers for years, now we get ambushed?

Guerrilla Fighter:
No actual fighting...? Cowards! You'll pay for underestimating the guerrillas!

Guerrilla Fighter:
Watch the altar! The protection the Captain gave us only mitigates its effects. He told us a million times not to go near it unless we have to!

Guerrilla Fighter:
Runner, get the other teams on the horn.

Guerrilla Fighter:
...No response?

Guerrilla Fighter:
Where are the mortars? And the devils?

Guerrilla Fighter:
......

Guerrilla Fighter:
Hold on. Something's not right.

Rosmontis:
Runner Twelve, destroyed!

Rhodes Island Operator:
The guerrilla fighters are closing ranks! Now's our best chance to break through!

Amiya:
...Hmm..

Amiya:
Roger. Rosmontis, let's scan the area with our Arts.

Rosmontis:
I can't reach it. The enemy... is blocking me somehow.

Kal'tsit:
Sarkaz casters. They're the only ones who could interfere with Arts like Rosmontis's.

Amiya:
Then it's up to me...!

Kal'tsit:
Raidian, how long can you keep it up?

Kal'tsit:
...We'll be quick.

Amiya:
I... I found them. Yes. They have a lot of snipers and casters hidden in those buildings.

Amiya:
They're calm... some agitated. But they're not fanatics. They're... fortifying that point.

Amiya:
...Duty.

Amiya:
The Doctor is right. It's a trap.

Rosmontis:
I'm nearby. I'm coming.

Amiya:
Can you do it?

Rosmontis:
Yes. I won't smash the whole building. I'll just destroy the level they're on, so they won't bother us.

Rosmontis:
Amiya, I can do it.

Amiya:
Right, Rosmontis... I know you can. Definitely.

Rosmontis:
...Amiya, will you p'ei fu me then?

Amiya:
Err? What?

Rosmontis:
I heard Blaze say there aren't many people who can make you p'ei fu them.

Amiya:
P'ei fu? Oh... does that mean 'respect?' Sorry, I'm not so good with the Yan language. I'm pretty sure that's what it means?

Rosmontis:
I don't know, Amiya...

Amiya:
...Doesn't matter. Because I've always 'p'ei fu'd' Rosmontis.

Amiya:
You're amazing, really. I couldn't do what you do...

Amiya:
I couldn't bear that loss and loneliness.

Amiya:
There's no way I could live with it like you do, suffer through it like you do.

Rosmontis:
You're lying.

Amiya:
......

Rosmontis:
But it doesn't matter to me. Even if you're a liar, you're still Amiya to me.

Rosmontis:
Someone could... p'ei fu... a person like me?

Amiya:
It's like you just said, Rosmontis. You're Rosmontis, so I respect you. As both an elite operator and a friend.

Amiya:
Keep at it, Rosmontis.

Rosmontis:
Okay. We'll keep at it.

Guerrilla Fighter:
Where are they? What are they waiting for?

Guerrilla Fighter:
N-No! We can't leave the area! We strike as soon as they show their faces! No one else falls out of contact!

Guerrilla Fighter:
Hey, is that an enemy on top of that building over there?

Guerrilla Fighter:
...A cat? Just one little Feline...?!

Guerrilla Fighter:
Runner! Tell the casters! The enemy deployed a caster on the building across the way!

Guerrilla Fighter:
We've gotta take her out!

Guerrilla Fighter:
—A sword? A weapon? She's pulling them out of the air...

Guerrilla Fighter:
Huh? Floating weapons?

Rosmontis:
Slice from here, to there.

Rosmontis:
Hold it... with my hands. Cut, with the sword.

Rosmontis:
...Like slicing a potato.

Like slicing a potato.

Kal'tsit:
Doctor! Get over here!

Kal'tsit:
Rosmontis is destroying the guerrillas' ambush point. Watch for falling debris!

Kal'tsit:
Assuming you're talking about Rosmontis's Arts, it may be time to explain it to you, now that you've seen it so many times.

Kal'tsit:
It is a state of mind she shapes herself. You can think of it like Rosmontis has a gigantic, second, invisible body that cannot be acted upon.

Kal'tsit:
It is a formless extension of her sense of touch. She can grab, squeeze, lift up, and toss away.

Kal'tsit:
But these Arts lack objective manifestation, as opposed to her subjective mind.

Kal'tsit:
It can act upon us with force, but we cannot act upon it. We only know it exists with the application of special Originium Arts.

Kal'tsit:
You need not grasp it fully. This is not your area of expertise.

Kal'tsit:
Rosmontis was much more destructive before we put a weapon in her hands. A lot like being crushed beneath the treads of a nomadic city. All that's left is a crying young girl alone in the ruins.

Kal'tsit:
Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen again.

Kal'tsit:
...Doctor, move.

Kal'tsit:
I see it. The command group is coming...

Kal'tsit:
There should be a waterway under the ruins of the park fountain.

Kal'tsit:
They hid in such an inconspicuous place.

Kal'tsit:
...The story of the ambush on Graymane Peak, that supposedly involved seven straight days of stakeout and tricked the strongest of knights, may well have been true.

Kal'tsit:
Let's go, Dr. {@nickname}. No time to lose.

Kal'tsit:
Raidian, cease fire. Find a good place to hide. I need you to focus on keeping our comms up.

Kal'tsit:
Mantra-2, log all our conversations. Every last word.

Rosmontis:
Runner Group Fourteen, successfully intercepted.

Rosmontis:
Amiya, Dr. Kal'tsit, I'm ready.

Guerrilla Fighter:
(Are you okay...? Talk to me! Look at me!)

Guerrilla Fighter:
(Good, you're with us. I'm okay. Doesn't matter. You hide somewhere, don't let them find you... we need you to regroup.)

Guerrilla Fighter:
(I know. We'll get them. You stay quiet!)

Guerrilla Fighter:
(I'm fine. No injuries. A little stone is nothing compared to an Ursus Fortcracker.)

Guerrilla Fighter:
(Don't panic! I can stop it, you look for an opening!)

Guerrilla Fighter:
......

Guerrilla Fighter:
You! What are you looking at?! Too scared to fight us?

Guerrilla Fighter:
Whoever you are, you lost the guts to take us on now? Too scared of Patriot's blood? Scared of his witchcraft?

Guerrilla Fighter:
Thinking back to the time you fought the Sarkaz? You had them outnumbered, you could've won, but in the end you just ran up the casualties!

Guerrilla Fighter:
But we'll do you one better! You can't break our shields, you can't crack our armor! You're nothing before the undying Patriot!

Guerrilla Fighter:
The mightiest Ursus warrior... needs no spear or shield. He'll stomp you to pieces.

Guerrilla Fighter:
You... are nothing!

Guerrilla Fighter:
Our fighters will regroup here soon! You can't run. Reunion will put you through hell!

Guerrilla Fighter:
Oppressors who enslave the Infected like us! You will be swallowed up by the Reunion movement!

Guerrilla Fighter:
Reunion—

Amiya:
...Reunion already betrayed you, sir.

Guerrilla Fighter:
—Little girl?

Rosmontis:
......

Guerrilla Fighter:
...Two... Infected little girls?

Guerrilla Fighter:
What are you doing?!

Rosmontis:
Out of the way.

Rosmontis:
There's a man behind you, and I'm going to break the device behind him.

Guerrilla Fighter:
......

Guerrilla Fighter:
You think I'll show you mercy just because you look like a kid?

Guerrilla Fighter:
Don't underestimate Patriot's Guard! We're the Aegis of the Infected... I'm here to stop your attack.

Guerrilla Fighter:
If you attack the Infected, I'll strangle you with my own two hands!

Rosmontis:
Then my weapons will talk for me.

Guerrilla Fighter:
You... You're the cat from before.

Guerrilla Fighter:
Your sword...

Runner:
(Get out of here, guardian! Tell the others! I'll be okay!)

Guerrilla Fighter:
(That's your job, not mine! You have to survive!)

Guerrilla Fighter:
Come, try to pierce my shield! Try to break my armor!

Rosmontis:
Amiya. I'm out of options.

Amiya:
But...

Rosmontis:
He won't die. But he may never walk again.

Rosmontis:
Go. Stab...

???:
You, can't.

Amiya:
?!

Rosmontis:
How... you blocked my sword with your bare hands?

Rosmontis:
Hm... My hand... numb...

Rosmontis:
When did you get here? I never felt...

Rosmontis:
No. Oh... I think... I thought that was a building collapsing, but that was you?

Rosmontis:
You, no, you and your team... You're like...

Rosmontis:
...a mountain.

???:
......

Kal'tsit:
Rosmontis, fall back.

Rosmontis:
But I...

Kal'tsit:
That's an order, Rosmontis.

Kal'tsit:
An order.

Guerrilla Fighter:
Captain...!

Patriot:
You did, well. Go, regroup.

Patriot:
Now, you...

Patriot:
Rhodes Island.

Patriot:
I don't care, who, you are.

Patriot:
You attacked, my men. You, die.

Kal'tsit:
Are you sure you don't care?

Patriot:
Very, sure—

Patriot:
Wait... wait.

Patriot:
You...

Kal'tsit:
...Buldrokkas'tee.

Patriot:
You... how...?

Kal'tsit:
It's been a while.

Patriot:
You... Dame Kal'tsit?
