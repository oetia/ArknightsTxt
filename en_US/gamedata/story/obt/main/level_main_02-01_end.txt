It's just like the rumors said...

Amiya:
Let's go, Doctor.

Amiya:
We're here.

Rhodes Island was scheduled to meet with the L.G.D. at 10 o'clock.

???:
It's 10:14 now.

???:
You were late 14 minutes; therefore, you've wasted 14 minutes of my time.

Amiya:
...I'm sorry, Madam Ch'en, we just found out that Reunion is here...

Ch'en:
It's fine, I already know. But that's not important right now.

Ch'en:
...Who might this be?

Amiya:
Dr. {@nickname} is Rhodes Island's consultant. Dr. Kal'tsit should already have informed you.

Ch'en:
Hmm...

Ch'en:
Well, since everyone is here, I'll now need you to follow me to...

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en! It's an emergency! Those Infected... they're not...

Ch'en:
Don't panic!

Ch'en:
First Squad, standby! Snipers, get into position!

Civilian:
Wh-what's happening?!

Infected:
Let go of me! !

Ch'en:
Tch... What's going on? Report the situation.

Infected:
Let me go! ! Why are you arresting me? !

Infected:
We didn't do anything wrong! ! !

L.G.D. Agent:
Some Infected... are refusing to be taken in... We're...

Ch'en:
I can see that...

Ch'en:
Forget it.

Ch'en:
Detain them all.

Ch'en:
Disperse the crowd immediately. Open the gates in 30 minutes after you finish the review process.

Ch'en:
Also, push the quarantine inspection line forward 40 meters.

Ch'en:
Other than you and Dr. {@nickname}, the rest of Rhodes Island will stay here and assist with border security. The two of you, come with me.

Ch'en:
If your group can't handle such a trivial task, I will not be able to assign you any missions.

Ch'en:
PC94172, arrange some work for these people. I don't want to see any more trouble tonight.

L.G.D. Agent:
Understood, Madam!

L.G.D. Agent:
Everyone, I'd like you to...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
(Madam Ch'en is really tough... she's stricter than I imagined...)

Ch'en:
You two.

Ch'en:
Follow me.

Ch'en:
We're here.

Amiya:
Wh-what a tall building!

Ch'en:
...

Amiya:
Ugh...

Amiya:
S-sorry...

Ch'en:
... Rhodes Island is undoubtedly capable.

Amiya:
Oh...

Amiya:
Thank you for your praise, Madam.

Ch'en:
However...

Ch'en:
After the Chernobog incident, there's been a massive surge of refugees into Lungmen.

Ch'en:
The Infected should already know what the consequences of entering Lungmen are.

???:
I'll remind you once more.

???:
Lungmen is the next Chernobog.

Amiya:
Dr. Kal'tsit...!

Ch'en:
Rhodes Island's representative has already met with Chief Wei.

Ch'en:
Please wait here.

Ch'en:
I'll notify you shortly.

Amiya:
Phew... she's really hard to talk to.

Amiya:
Dr. {@nickname}, from here on, Dr. Kal'tsit will be handling the negotiations.

Amiya:
Please have confidence in her.
