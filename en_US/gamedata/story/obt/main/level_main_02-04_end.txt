Franka:
All clear!

Franka:
You were right... This bunch came prepared!

Franka:
You guys should pick up the pace too!

Misha:
*gasp*... Just who are you people... *pant*...

Amiya:
Everyone, please move faster!

Liskarm:
Amiya, we're being pursued from behind.

Liskarm:
Do we have time to counterattack?

Amiya:
Not at the moment...

Amiya:
It's better to try to shake them off and avoid unnecessary battles...

Liskarm:
Forget about the safety issue...

Liskarm:
I need a route that can get us out of the slums to Madam Ch'en as soon as possible.

Liskarm:
Reunion is already on our trail...

Liskarm:
The more ground we have to cover, the more danger we'll be in!

Exusiai:
That's easy to do. I have a route here that the enemy will never think of.

Liskarm:
Do you already have something in mind?

Exusiai:
Of course~

Exusiai:
But I'll have to take a look myself first to see if my info is reliable or not.

Liskarm:
Try to be quick about it.

Exusiai:
Got it~ Anyway, I'll be right back!

Exusiai:
If you need anything, please contact another Penguin Logistics agent!

Misha:
...

Misha:
Can I ask... where we're going?

Amiya:
We're meeting with the L.G.D.

Amiya:
They will protect you.

Misha:
...Huh?

Misha:
...the L.G.D.?

Amiya:
Our current mission is to safely escort you to the L.G.D., and they will provide you with protection.

Misha:
...

Misha:
I almost believed... that you were really here to save me.

Amiya:
No, we really are...

Amiya:
Our original plan was to ask Lungmen to entrust some of their Infected with us...

Amiya:
But after hearing our report, the L.G.D. suddenly asked us to transfer you to them.

Amiya:
Besides... in Lungmen, you'll be safest under their protection.

Amiya:
If we don't act now, you'll be in grave peril.

Amiya:
Many of the Infected that were coming after you were already wearing Reunion's badge...

Misha:
I don't know anything about this 'Reunion' that you're talking about, but...

Misha:
But I do know the L.G.D., and I've seen how they treat the Infected. If you wanted me to capture me from the beginning, you should've just said it.

Amiya:
I'm sorry... But, that's really not our intention. I know there are still some misunderstandings that have to be worked out.

Amiya:
But no matter how bad you think we are... Please, just bear with us a bit longer.

Amiya:
Your safety takes priority over how you feel.

Amiya:
I'll explain everything if I get the chance.

Amiya:
After all, there are still things that I want to know...

Misha:
...
