Amiya:
This place... is filled with fallen Reunion.

Amiya:
...The blood from his wounds had been frozen, but his other body parts remained intact.

Amiya:
This is Frostleaf's technique.

Amiya:
...Those ruins over there look like they were caused by explosives.

Amiya:
It's probably Meteorite's work.

Amiya:
(Frostleaf... Jessica... Meteorite... I'm sure they're still alive...)

Kal'tsit:
Amiya, all the rescue squads have reached Rhodes Island.

Kal'tsit:
We've extracted all the recon squads except for Meteorite's.

Kal'tsit:
No Operators were lost on this mission, but...

Kal'tsit:
Everyone suffered frostbite with varying degrees of severity.

Kal'tsit:
You must take note of this.

Amiya:
...Frostbite?

Kal'tsit:
All our recon squads observed a special group of Reunion troops wandering around the city.

Kal'tsit:
Unlike the reckless Reunion soldiers we're used to fighting, these members had a special way of fighting.

Kal'tsit:
Be cautious.

Amiya:
I.... I understand.

Kal'tsit:
Dr. {@nickname}, am I clear?

Kal'tsit:
Very well then.

Kal'tsit:
I also have some things to do.

Kal'tsit:
Amiya, even if Dr. {@nickname} is very helpful, you can't rely too much on a single person.

Amiya:
...

Kal'tsit:
Also, mind the rings.

Amiya:
I know.

Amiya:
Dr. Kal'tsit actually worries about you a lot.

Amiya:
Before we realized it...

Amiya:
Dangerous beasts have bared their fangs.

Amiya:
Mm... They will do everything they can to keep us from getting away.

Amiya:
But, we didn't come here to run away.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island will break through their ranks.

Amiya:
We're going to rescue Meteorite's squad!

Kal'tsit:
Projekt Red, do you copy?

Kal'tsit:
Ahh, yes.

Kal'tsit:
That's right. I'll meet you at the slums' east entrance.

Kal'tsit:
Mhm. It'll just be the two of us.

Kal'tsit:
We'll be fine.

Kal'tsit:
Just the two of us are more than enough to fight against Reunion.
