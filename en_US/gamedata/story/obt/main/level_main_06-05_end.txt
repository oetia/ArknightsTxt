Meanwhile, on the other side of the slums...

Crownslayer:
Calm down! Say it again slowly.

Reunion Member:
B- but... all of them... they're all dead!

Reunion Member:
What's happening? What happened? I can't see! I can't see anything!

Reunion Member:
Gah!

Crownslayer:
Say again!

......

Crownslayer:
......

Crownslayer:
Report!

...phew.

Crownslayer:
Who's there?!

Crownslayer:
...that smell. Don't panic! Everyone's still here!

Crownslayer:
Listen up!

Reunion Member:
Aaah! It's red! I saw it! I saw the red!

Crownslayer:
Calm him down!

... (Inhuman laughing).

Reunion Member:
I... I want to go home... I want to go back to Ursus...

Reunion Member:
There's ghosts here! And monsters! I saw the shadows... of two women!

Reunion Member:
Aaaaaagh! I want to go home!

Reunion Member:
We shouldn't have come, Crownslayer!

Crownslayer:
Do you copy? Answer me!

Crownslayer:
The layout of these slums is confusing, but don't let the enemy confuse you. We are perfectly safe!

Crownslayer:
(How is our position still exposed with all the fog?)

Talulah:
There remains the traitor's position. I am aware.

Talulah:
She is in Lungmen. Kill her. Make a name for yourself that your enemies should fear.

Crownslayer:
......!

FrostNova:
After you've killed your rival, then what? Don't forget your true enemy.

Crownslayer:
——Who?!

Swire:
Bring her to me!

Guard:
Sorry, Swire, bring you who?

Swire:
Bring her to me!!!

Guard:
Erm?

Guard:
(Who is she talking about?)

L. G. D. Officer:
(I don't know, maybe...)

Swire:
That pink-haired sewer scum! Dial 100800-00200-rct211-93001! That's her number!

Guard:
(How did she memorize a number that long?)

L. G. D. Officer:
(That number is familiar... Is it that one lady...?)

Swire:
What are you two whispering about?!

???:
Hello.

Swire:
What are you up to, you filthy rat?! What have you done?!

???:
And why do you suspect me?

Swire:
I'm glad it wasn't you. Phew. You had me worried there...

???:
......

Swire:
......

Swire:
Suspect you of what?

???:
If you're talking about the special forces, that was me.

Swire:
......

Swire:
Lin Yühsia, I think I misheard something. I misheard you, didn't I?

Lin Yühsia:
The L. G. D. has its business, and we have ours.

Lin Yühsia:
Wei Yenwu has you to keep order in Lungmen, and we are here to remove that which Lungmen does not need.

Swire:
You know what this team did in the slums?

Lin Yühsia:
They helped you deal with Reunion quite efficiently.

Swire:
That buffer zone was your father's blood, sweat, and tears!

Swire:
It's all thanks to him and his work in the slums that Lungmen is what it is today!

Lin Yühsia:
Do you know their objective?

Swire:
You've made it very clear. The slums are full of places for Reunion to hide, not to mention their invasion route. You'd level them!

Swire:
Isn't that right?

Swire:
We're working with Rhodes Island now. Reunion is no match for us! You don't have to do this!

Lin Yühsia:
Jumping to conclusions before I even have a chance to explain...

Lin Yühsia:
While Reunion is certainly no match for us, they're still not a problem for civilian forces to solve.

Lin Yühsia:
We must use the true power of our city to eradicate this threat. This is how I face the invaders.

Swire:
Why can't you put your faith in Rhodes Island and our own L. G. D.?

Lin Yühsia:
Why should we trust Rhodes Island? And why dirty the hands of the L. G. D.?

Swire:
What do you mean dirty...?

Swire:
Don't tell me you had no other choice. That's your father's land.

Swire:
It takes so much more to build than to destroy!

Swire:
Breaking a pane of glass takes one person one second... Do you know how long it takes to make one? How many people are involved?

Lin Yühsia:
Swire.

Swire:
Hm?

Lin Yühsia:
Do you know what it is the people fear? Do you know what it is that scares the chambers of commerce?

Swire:
What's wrong with you? Aren't we facing off against Reunion?

Lin Yühsia:
You really don't understand at all.

Swire:
Fine. Filthy rat... I don't understand. Might I humble myself and request that you grace me with an explanation?

Lin Yühsia:
The Infected... are growing in number. The people fear the Infected, and they don't care if they're Reunion or not.

Lin Yühsia:
In short, don't go looking in the sewers.

Swire:
Huh?

Swire:
Hello? Are you there?! Stinking, shit-eating rat!!

Swire:
You dare hang up on me! Sei puk gaai syu ah! How dare you hang up on me?!!

Lin Yühsia:
......

Lin Yühsia:
Ch'en chased off the Black Cloaks?

Lin Yühsia:
What to do about that...

Lin Yühsia:
They'll move past her, and accelerate the pace. Hm, that will do.

Lin Yühsia:
Dad, if you were me, if the younger you were me, this is what you'd do too, isn't it?

Lin Yühsia:
...What am I doing...?

Mephisto:
What do you mean? That's impossible.

Phantom Crossbowman:
Your herd is shrinking.

Phantom Crossbowman:
The initial attack was ferocious and terrifying, but... We're not really sure why, but our scouts report their numbers aren't growing.

Phantom Crossbowman:
Unfortunately, the group that suffered the most from this tactic was the Reunion squad that sustained the initial attack.

Mephisto:
Who? Who did this? The L. G. D.? The L. G. D. could never suppress my herd!

Phantom Crossbowman:
But our people...

Mephisto:
I took the L. G. D.'s tactics and equipment into consideration. Facing my herd should have delayed them at least two days. So who is it that's done this?!

Faust:
People in black raincoats.

Phantom Crossbowman:
Captain!

Mephisto:
Faust!

Faust:
Crossbowmen, reform the squad! Mine and a few other teams have scooped up a lot of Mephisto's people.

Phantom Crossbowman:
...Why?

Faust:
Together, we can hold back the L. G. D.

Mephisto:
Faust, Faust... are you hurt?

Mephisto:
(Why did you leave back there?)

Faust:
...Because I had to.

Mephisto:
And I'm glad to see how many of our people you've brought back with you. You'll put them to good use against the L. G. D. I'm sure?

Mephisto:
They won't attack us, but I can't control them. I've been wracking my brain over it.

Mephisto:
There aren't many left though.

Mephisto:
We will need more of our people to protect us. We must defeat those L. G. D.s if we're going to escape.

Mephisto:
Hm...

Faust:
Mephisto, don't use those Arts again.

Mephisto:
But didn't you say we have to survive, Faust? Isn't that what's most important?

Faust:
...Then why did you...?

Faust:
......

Faust:
Why did you say you would die for that monster, back at the L. G. D. Headquarters?

Faust:
Crossbowmen.

Phantom Crossbowman:
Ready.

Faust:
Take him.
