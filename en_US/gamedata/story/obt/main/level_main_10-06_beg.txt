Burn this view of the city into your memories.

Every time a new skyscraper is built, countless old buildings are inevitably torn down. It is this thick layer of dust, accumulated over tens of hundreds of years, that made today's Londinium.

When you inherit these lands, not only will you inherit the extravagant furs you see on the outside. You must also accept the scars that lie underneath.

It is extraordinarily difficult to build a new house among these old ones.

Your eyes need to be able to see through the flesh and into the bones to find the place with the firmest foundation that can support the entire city.

This will be your starting point.

Vina, it is when you forget everything that you must inherit that you will truly become a proper successor.

Siege:
......

Dagda:
Siege, please think this through again. Follow my advice.

Dagda:
We must leave this place, this dark underground cavern at once.

Dagda:
Only timid metal crabs and insects hide underground. I can't stand hiding down here while our enemies are wreaking havoc above our heads.

Indra:
You know, the way you talk is really getting on my nerves...

Indra:
How could you call any of them spineless when every one of them stands up against the Sarkaz? If they were actually the cowards you make them out to be, they would've gone working for the Sarkaz long ago!

Dagda:
Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not trying to assign blame, but... there is only so much they can do.

Indra:
What do you mean, there is only so much they can do? Remember who it was that saved you when you made it out of Londinium, half-dead? How come you didn't say there was only so much we could do?

Dagda:
I don't want to argue with you.

Indra:
I'm not arguing with you either, but I don't want to hear your cranky little mouth either.

Indra:
Morgan and I told you when you first ran into us a year ago or so. If you wanted to join the Glasgow family, you'd have to rid yourself of your shitty aristocratic attitude.

Morgan:
Let me say a word on her behalf. Dagda's working very hard too. She's changed quite a bit.

Morgan:
At a glance, no one could tell that she used to be a knight-noble.

Dagda:
Right, I learned a lot... from all of you. I'm sure you know that I've long thought of myself as a part of Glasgow.

Dagda:
But now we're back in Londinium, I just can't help but be aware that I'm also a Knight of the Tower.

Indra:
Don't you think that anything has changed just because we're back in Londinium.

Indra:
Do you know how many eyes are on Vina? We've never been safe. No, it's exactly because we're back now that we're especially in danger.

Dagda:
I agree with you on that.

Dagda:
And it's out of safety considerations that I think we should leave these militants we don't know the first thing about.

Morgan:
Dagda, you mean you're worried the resistance could act against Vina?

Dagda:
Their membership is too much of a mixed bag... What if some of them don't actually mean well?

Indra:
Where do you think we should go, then?

Dagda:
As far as I know, there are still some in the city that we can count on. My mother's friends.

Dagda:
I couldn't contact them before the Knights of the Tower fell, but the way I see it... now might be a good time.

Indra:
You mean... You want us to turn to the nobles?!

Indra:
Who do you think murdered Vina's dad and forced her to hide out on the streets for years?

Indra:
Who do you think... hunted us down and chased us out of Londinium? We don't even know if Baird and the rest of the gang are still alive!

Dagda:
The nobles weren't of one mind back then... but after the Sarkaz came...

Indra:
Hah... you think the Sarkaz are our only enemy?!

Indra:
Listen up, my lady! You want to hand Vina over to those dirty lords? Over my dead body!

Morgan:
Hannah!

Morgan:
What are you doing, shouting like that? Do you want everyone to know who Vina is?!

Indra:
......

Dagda:
......

Morgan:
Both of you, calm down. Fighting can't solve everything, especially at a crucial moment like this!

Morgan:
Until you've really thought through the consequences of your bickering, you'd better shut your mouths.

Morgan:
What do you want Vina to...?

Siege:
It doesn't matter.

Morgan:
Vina? W-What do you have in mind?

Morgan:
I think Dagda's worries are reasonable. We followed Amiya and the Doctor here, but... in the end, our objective isn't the same as theirs.

Morgan:
All they have to do is stop the Sarkaz in the city, and that's exactly what the resistance has been trying to do.

Morgan:
But we...

Siege:
What do you think our objective is?

Morgan:
Uh...

Siege:
Morgan, Indra.

Siege:
Why did you recognize me as your leader, back then?

Morgan:
Because Glasgow needed to survive in Londinium.

Morgan:
We were still kids, and we made a lot of enemies. A lot of street punks had their eyes on us, and there were even a couple bad cops who always gave us trouble...

Indra:
Vina, you're so much more incredible than the rest of us.

Indra:
You're the one who taught me that a good boss doesn't just fight. Not only did you lead us out of trouble, you recruited so many faces into the gang, you made Glasgow stronger.

Indra:
That's why I'm confident you're a good boss, and that you'll be a good leader in the future.

Siege:
Very good. Looks like we haven't forgotten our convictions.

Siege:
Have you heard what the resistance commander said?

Siege:
They'll save Londinium, but before that, they'll save their brothers and sisters in arms.

Siege:
Who's to say our objectives are different?

Siege:
My hammer was forged to serve this city... to serve Victoria. If my strength can save even just one Victorian, then I have no reason to leave the fight.

Dagda:
......

Siege:
Dagda.

Dagda:
Sorry... I won't bring that up again.

Siege:
No, I just wanted to say you aren't in the wrong.

Dagda:
What...?

Siege:
If you have your own mission to accomplish, you needn't follow my every word.

Siege:
You are a fine knight, but I'm not the one who knighted you.

Siege:
I'm not the lord you were born to serve. No... You should find the one you actually want to serve instead of being bound by your bloodline's oath. You're free, and you always have been.

Dagda:
Siege?!

Morgan:
Vina, that's a little...

Indra:
It's not like Dagda was...

Siege:
Enough. You heard me well.

Siege:
Dagda, I await your answer.

Dagda:
......

Dagda:
Understood, Siege.

Amiya:
Commander Clovisia, have you thought about our cooperation proposal?

Clovisia:
Amiya... May I call you Amiya? Please call me Clovisia.

Amiya:
Ah... Of course, Clovisia.

Clovisia:
Dr.{@nickname} and you have more than sufficiently explained what your purpose here is. If I'm understanding you correctly, Rhodes Island is a pharmaceutical company that focuses on solving Infected issues?

Clovisia:
To that end, your company has worked with cities and even countries... I also know that most Sarkaz are infected.

Clovisia:
But... I just wanted to make sure about this. Did you come to Londinium with this objective too?

Clovisia:
Or is it part of Rhodes Island's business to solve the Sarkaz question as well?

Amiya:
The Sarkaz are not a question.

Amiya:
Clovisia, the way we see it, the real issue at hand is the war between the Sarkaz and the Victorians.

Amiya:
This war has already seen more than enough bloodshed on both the Victorian and Sarkaz sides...

Amiya:
If the war escalates further, what happens then? How many countries will be dragged into it? How many people?

Amiya:
We can't allow that to happen.

Clovisia:
Amiya, your ideals... are noble. You are Infected, and you want to fight for the Infected. I can understand that... but what do you have to do with the Sarkaz?

Amiya:
I... I inherited my ideals from a Sarkaz. She was a Sarkaz, but she loved me, a Cautus, and she loved everyone.

Amiya:
And Rhodes Island... Rhodes Island was born from her feelings.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island fights for the Infected, the Sarkaz, and all those who are oppressed because we know very well that, in war, they are always neglected by those cruel men who stand at the top.

Amiya:
It doesn't matter how many of arrogant men in positions of power we have to deal with. Our focus will always be those who truly need our help.

Clovisia:
The cruel men who stand at the top... eh?

Clovisia:
I see. I can empathize with how you feel, and I very much respect Rhodes Island's ideals.

Clovisia:
However... I hope you can understand that the Self-Salvation Corps is not the same as Rhodes Island. Our people come from different backgrounds and have different ideals. And even so, we are all fighting for the same goal.

Clovisia:
—We want to take back Londinium.

Clovisia:
If we can't be sure that Rhodes Island will always be on our side, even if you could persuade me, I wouldn't be able to persuade my men.

Clovisia:
Dr. {@nickname}... Do I have your word?

Clovisia:
Right, I admit. You've seen for yourself that the Self-Salvation Corps is low on manpower. We can't spare anyone to your cause.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island will not be a burden to the Self-Salvation Corps.

Clovisia:
No, you're mistaken, Amiya. Most of us aren't worried about your strength. It might actually be the opposite, even.

Clovisia:
Your mission is far too ambitious. Besides, you saw it yourself. The Self-Salvation Corps hides in the gaps and crevices of the city just to make it from one battle to the next.

Clovisia:
If what you actually want is a larger battlefield, and it just so happens that the battlefield is Londinium—

Clovisia:
......

Clovisia:
Dr. {@nickname}, I'm surprised you are so honest.

Clovisia:
You are admitting to me that although you don't currently have what it takes to face the Sarkaz—

Clovisia:
When the time is right, Rhodes Island's objective is to depose the tyrannical Regent?

Amiya:
Doctor... *Cough*...

Amiya:
(That's not what we said before we came...)

Amiya:
This isn't how we usually earn the trust of our collaborators...

Amiya:
No... You're right. Just like how even though we always seek to end wars, we have never been able to avoid one.

Amiya:
Clovisia, our objective is clear. Just like the Self-Salvation Corps, Rhodes Island will fight for the day we successfully stop the Sarkaz Regent.

Clovisia:
......Dr. {@nickname}... you and Amiya are excellent partners.

Clovisia:
It seems Feist is right. You're the helpers we've been looking for.

Amiya:
What did Mr. Feist...

Clovisia:
He spoke on your behalf in front of me and all the captains.

Amiya:
What about that problem earlier, then?

Clovisia:
He's still young. Even though he has the courage to stand up and speak, he isn't ready to take responsibility for the outcome. This burden is for me to shoulder.

Amiya:
But you're young too.

Clovisia:
Haha, but I'm their commander. In my position, you would do the same too, wouldn't you?

Amiya:
Yes... Right, I know you just wanted us to explain our position one more time.

Clovisia:
I hope you don't mind.

Amiya:
O-Of course I don't mind! Both the Doctor and I are happy... to have found an excellent partner.

Clovisia:
Dr. {@nickname}, Feist told me about you, but you're still... not what I expected.

Clovisia:
When the reconnaissance team comes back, let us plan out this operation together.

Clovisia:
This will be a rescue mission. I believe your Operators are very experienced in such missions?

Clovisia:
I look forward to working with Rhodes Island.

Bill:
Rockrock, my men just got some news from Lady Golding.

Rockrock:
Tell our contact we'll be there right away.

Bill:
Phew... It's a good thing we got in contact with the Messenger. If it wasn't for her, I'm not sure we would've been able to locate the prison.

Rockrock:
Yeah, I only hope this trip will be fruitful.

Bill:
Right, what's going on with you and Feist.

Rockrock:
Nothing.

Bill:
I heard you squabbling. Ever since we formed a team together, the two of you always worked together so well, like hand in glove. I've never seen you fight like that.

Rockrock:
We have differing opinions, that's all.

Bill:
How do you know you aren't of one mind? You should've talked to him about the past long ago. He may always be banging away at his devices, but he'll listen to you.

Rockrock:
Is this why you came along? I didn't know you liked mending relationships as much as welding things together.

Bill:
Haha, it's all the same to me. You're both good soldiers, and I've always thought of you as siblings.

Rockrock:
Watch your nine!

Bill:
Phew, that was close... How come there are so many mercenaries out on the streets?

Rockrock:
The Sarkaz are trying to catch us. Rock-5...

Rockrock:
Hm... Rock-5 sees our contact. In the bakery up ahead. Go. I'll keep an eye on the mercenaries.

Feist:
Hey, Bill, could you get this part over to Harmo? I think he could use it when he reinforces his grain lorry.

???:
Uh... alright.

Feist:
Hand me the wrench.

???:
......

Feist:
Franck's shield, too. I put on a new coat of paint on the surface. That should make it fireproof, but remind him that it's going to crack if he lets it get too hot for too long!

???:
Hm... The technology behind this paint is obsolete.

???:
Why don't you try out Raythean's latest formula? It's kinda expensive, but Engineering came up with a cheap generic version. If you're interested, I can give you a discount.

Feist:
Huh?

Feist:
Hot hot hot!

Closure:
Whoa, you got a hole in your thermal gloves? Are you an engineer for real? Hands are like the most important thing to an engineer!

Feist:
Gloves are a luxury! I can't grab new ones just because I want to!

Feist:
Besides, how was I supposed to know you were here? My hands are usually a lot stabler.

Closure:
Your eyes don't look so good to me either. That's like one of the ten must-have qualities of an engineer.

Feist:
*Cough*, Old Bill's to blame for this...

Feist:
Where did he go? Usually he's the only one to stand next to me.

Closure:
Oh, when I got here, I saw a group following your lieutenant somewhere.

Feist:
Didn't he promise to come help me out?

Closure:
You worried about them?

Feist:
Rockrock left in a hurry. I didn't even have the time to check out Rock-5.

Feist:
I'm worried that brawl this morning could've damaged the drones somehow...

Closure:
Hmm... If you're worried about other stuff, there's no way you'll pop out anything too sturdy.

Closure:
This is all we can do, and it's only by doing it well that things will be safer for our friends aboveground, right?

Feist:
Haha... I didn't expect Rhodes Island's engineer to be so good at comforting people.

Closure:
Huh? What are you even talking about? I'll have you know I'm Rhodes Island's ace psychological consultant. Even Kal'tsit... uh, a real mean boss of mine comes to me and opens up to destress!

Closure:
So, hurry up and hand me the wrench.

Feist:
Huh?

Closure:
Let's get working already! What, you want me to crack a few more jokes to lift your spirits?

Closure:
There's gonna be some real intense battles soon. Us Engineering Operators are like the backbone of the backbone. There's no time for all that moping!

Feist:
Ha... haha... Alright, let's get working.

Closure:
Right, show me that drone... Rock-17. It's lacking a flight stability module. I took one off my broken babies.

Feist:
Huh? You sure about that? Are there any patents or anything?

Closure:
Shh, quiet! I did it behind Dr.{@nickname}'s back!

Feist:
*cough* *cough* *cough*.

Closure:
Now that you know how lucky you are, what are you standing there for? Get me my wrench!

Bill:
W-What did you say...? You saw Lady Golding? What did she say?

Bill:
Understood... We need to send word about this to the commander right now!

Bill:
Nngh—! H-Hostiles! They found us! Rockrock, retreat!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Find the captain! Rebels spotted on Euston Road!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Seize them!

Rockrock:
Run!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
What's this buzzing thing...? A drone? I get it. You were at the port this morning!

Rockrock:
Rock-5—! What's the matter? Did we miss?!

Rockrock:
Is it because we didn't calibrate it...? We didn't spot the enemies just now, either... Nngh!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Feline, don't you think that's going to work. It might've worked on the Royal Court's squaddies, but it won't work on us.

Bill:
Rockrock, is your drone dead?!

Rockrock:
It's okay... Even without it, I can still fight.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Tsk... I didn't expect to take damage from you. Looks like your Arts are no less impressive than your courage.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I'll put in a word for you with my captain and let you die here. You don't have to go to the factory anymore. Saves you a painful death.

Rockrock:
Ugh––!

Bill:
Rockrock, get going! I'll hold it here!

Rockrock:
No, we'll go together!

Bill:
You need to get Lady Golding's message back...! The Commander must know... She must know... that the Messenger...

Rockrock:
......

Bill:
This message... is very important!

Rockrock:
Bill!

Bill:
I believe... in the commander... and I believe in you and Feist.

Bill:
Listen to me. Stop fighting. We're... all a family. Back then... we were only able to escape because your dad... your dad stood in the Sarkaz's way too.

Rockrock:
I...

Bill:
Go!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
*Cough*... *cough*! What's with the thick smoke... Did he have a grenade?!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
How dare you hurt my men! You aren't getting out of this alive!

Bill:
......

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Captain?

Hoederer:
Take him back, and lock him away with the other rebels.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Captain, this guy tried to blow us up and got himself caught in the blast. He won't live much longer.

Hoederer:
He doesn't have to live much longer.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Very well. it's the general's orders, right? Should we go after the rest of them?

Hoederer:
Do it.

Hoederer:
Don't hold out too much hope, though.
