Uptown Lungmen 7:20 P.M.

Ch'en:
*Pant* *pant*...

Hoshiguma:
...You're pretty serious about this.

Hoshiguma:
Real unexpected. Never would've thought... that you'd be able to make me bleed.

Ch'en:
We... have never... been able to walk away... from our past.

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, you've always been a part of this city. But... not me. I've always been running.

Ch'en:
I don't think I'll ever be able to stand this place.

Hoshiguma:
It turned into another one of these in the end.

Hoshiguma:
I can't stop you. Go.

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
Sorry, Hoshiguma.

Ch'en:
After I'm gone, please go to the slums for me. The people there are panicked and confused. Someone from the L.G.D. has to protect them.

Ch'en:
If some Infected kids give you a toy bear...

Ch'en:
Keep it. An Ursus girl named Misha taught them how to make those bears. She died, because we failed her.

Hoshiguma:
Okay. I will.

Ch'en:
I'm sorry. I owe you one.

Hoshiguma:
I don't need your apologies. Honestly, you're no good at them.

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma...

Hoshiguma:
...I think we're done here.

Hoshiguma:
Go! And don't come back.

Ch'en:
——

Ch'en:
...Take care of yourself.

Hoshiguma:
'Can't stand this place?'

Hoshiguma:
...How many people care about this city as much as you do?

Hoshiguma:
Bullshit...

L.G.D. Officer:
Inspector Hoshiguma!

L.G.D. Officer:
...Huh? Inspector, y-you're hurt? Who could have...

L.G.D. Officer:
Oh, yes, we just saw, err, Madame Ch'en——

Hoshiguma:
Oh, that, sorry.

Hoshiguma:
Do you guys have a second to talk?

L.G.D. Officer:
Inspector... you're disobeying orders too?

Hoshiguma:
...I wouldn't put it that way.

Wei Yenwu:
Get out.

???:
Yes, Lord Wei.

Wei Yenwu:
I told you... not to call me that.

???:
As you wish. We await your orders.

Fumizuki:
...

Fumizuki:
Miss Kal'tsit and Young Amiya, before you speak, could I have a word with him?

Amiya:
Yes, go ahead, Miss Fumizuki.

Kal'tsit:
All yours.

Fumizuki:
We've been together for years now, Wei Yenwu.

Wei Yenwu:
Why talk about this— Why now?

Fumizuki:
One look in your eyes and I can tell what you're thinking.

Wei Yenwu:
...Fumizuki.

Fumizuki:
Now, now. I've always been able to tell.

Fumizuki:
I know Lungmen means the world to you. I know all that you've given her. I know about the dreams you have for her.

Wei Yenwu:
No, Fumizuki...

Fumizuki:
But this, today, this isn't what you want, is it?

Fumizuki:
Ah, gomen. I'm not referring to our current dilemma.

Fumizuki:
What I mean is... this prosperity that you've given everything for.

Fumizuki:
You lost two loved ones. Actually, I think you said it was three. Maybe dozens?

Fumizuki:
Surely you couldn't bear to lose your niece as well.

Wei Yenwu:
She loathes the Shadow Guard. If I send them to retrieve her, she will fight them to the death.

Fumizuki:
No, Wei Yenwu... That's not what I mean.

Fumizuki:
Won't you regret it? If you let them both die in some foreign city?

Fumizuki:
So what if they're Infected? Are they not your nieces?

Fumizuki:
If we had children of our own, is this how you would treat them...?

Wei Yenwu:
All that I've done, I've done for the sake of our land. I never intended for Ch'en Hui-chieh to do my work for me.

Fumizuki:
But that's how she is!

Fumizuki:
No. Keeping the truth from her only deepens the cut. It only makes her feel like she doesn't belong here...

Fumizuki:
Your expectations of her, they're too distant, and too difficult.

Wei Yenwu:
But can I stop, at this point?

Wei Yenwu:
I have struggled against the men behind me and the city below me for so long, and this is all I have to show for it.

Wei Yenwu:
Would Lungmen allow me to stop?

Wei Yenwu:
That is what she wanted. To get to the source of our problems. She wanted to change this city into something completely unlike the city under my rule.

Wei Yenwu:
All I did was teach her how to get there, what she would have to do, and what she would have to give up.

Fumizuki:
All right, that's enough rationalizing. You're giving me a headache.

Fumizuki:
I'll go bring her home myself. I won't sit back and watch her die.

Fumizuki:
I will do what you cannot.

Wei Yenwu:
Nonsense! I won't allow it...!

Wei Yenwu:
I have plans to bring her back. And you, Fumizuki, are not to set foot outside this building.

Fumizuki:
Oh? You'll stop me?

Fumizuki:
Damare, kono yarou!

Kal'tsit:
Whew.

Amiya:
Huh? Doctor, what did Miss Fumizuki say?

Kal'tsit:
It's been a long time since I've heard such angry Higashinese.

Fumizuki:
Have you forgotten who I am, Wei Yenwu?

Wei Yenwu:
Even I have my limits, Fumizuki.

Fumizuki:
Have you forgotten who you are?

Wei Yenwu:
Fumizuki...!

Amiya:
...Doctor, I think...

Amiya:
(Mr. Wei might really care for Miss Fumizuki?)

Kal'tsit:
(The same may also go for Fumizuki. Maybe...)

Fumizuki:
Now then, on to our friends from Rhodes Island. How much will it cost for you to help Lungmen, and our Ch'en?

Fumizuki:
I'll cover it myself.

Wei Yenwu:
You...

Amiya:
You're really going to hire us like this, Miss Fumizuki?

Fumizuki:
I am.

Fumizuki:
It may be improper to say, but my husband is not exactly in top form today.

Fumizuki:
Or I might say, our opponent's plans have gone beyond anything we might have predicted, and included all that he holds dear.

Fumizuki:
They have a complete understanding of both Lungmen, and Wei Yenwu.

Wei Yenwu:
Fumizuki, that's enough!

Fumizuki:
Who are you to say what's enough?!

Fumizuki:
Doctor, name your price. I can pay.

Kal'tsit:
I understand everything you've said here, Miss Fumizuki. And money won't be necessary. But I need you two to hear me out.

Wei Yenwu:
...Doctor.

Kal'tsit:
Maybe this isn't the place to say it, but if I can speak freely, Lungmen needs some outside assistance.

Kal'tsit:
Can I continue, Miss Fumizuki?

Fumizuki:
By all means. I don't let words get to me.

Wei Yenwu:
...Nonsense...

Kal'tsit:
Rhodes Island is only a pharmaceutical company.

Kal'tsit:
But the world is a tough place. It doesn't let up on any of us. Especially a pharmaceutical company like ours that tends to make a lot of enemies be it in business, geopolitics, or otherwise.

Kal'tsit:
We wander the cracks between countries because we have no other choice.

Kal'tsit:
When all the forces of the world align to put pressure on us, we need our own special methods to handle them...

Kal'tsit:
But if our methods are to work— We need the forces acting against us to have a shred of sense left in their thick skulls.

Kal'tsit:
So when there comes a day like today, where anything could happen, Rhodes Island has to be ready with the right response.

Wei Yenwu:
Get to the point.

Kal'tsit:
I have a proposal.

Wei Yenwu:
I hope it's a good one.

Kal'tsit:
I'm not sure if I should be disclosing this information to you, Mr. Wei.

Kal'tsit:
You must know, with Lungmen's strength and your talents, you could annihilate Rhodes Island with a snap of your fingers.

Kal'tsit:
No matter how advanced our equipment may be, there is nothing we could do against your forces.

Kal'tsit:
If we act against you, Rhodes Island is as good as dead.

Kal'tsit:
...

Wei Yenwu:
Go on. Dr. Kal'tsit, Miss Amiya, rest assured I have no energy to direct at Rhodes Island anymore.

Wei Yenwu:
So please, proceed.

Kal'tsit:
Very well.

Kal'tsit:
When we first met, Mr. Wei, you were very curious about our military capabilities.

Kal'tsit:
I can admit now, as I just said, Rhodes Island is no match for Lungmen in this respect.

Kal'tsit:
However, no matter how strong a force may be, it can be limited by the circumstances it finds itself in. It's largely a difference of degree.

Kal'tsit:
Even your men can't project power with their hands tied. Even if you step onto the battlefield personally, the enemy still has something to use against you.

Kal'tsit:
The truth is, a colleague of mine once saw the Duke of Kashchey at a fundraising banquet with his adopted daughter.

Kal'tsit:
This wasn't a slave market or some noble bacchanal. It was an event for those who represent the many movers and shakers of our world.

Wei Yenwu:
...

Wei Yenwu:
...Continue.

Kal'tsit:
I'm sure you can guess what happened next, Mr. Wei. Many young people proved their value that night, with the ideas and theories that they espoused—

Kal'tsit:
But Talulah did not. Neither my colleagues nor I ever expected that she would become the leader of Reunion.

Kal'tsit:
In fact... we should have realized that the Duke of Kashchey only shows himself when necessary, to do what is necessary. Otherwise, he stays out of sight.

Kal'tsit:
Kashchey won't tip his hand in exchange for assistance, and neither will Talulah. I'm sure you know their relationship much better than we do, Mr. Wei.

Kal'tsit:
The Duke of Kashchey never made her a slave or a hostage.

Wei Yenwu:
She is his successor.

Fumizuki:
Oh?

Wei Yenwu:
Your observations confirm my suspicions, Dr. Kal'tsit. Talulah is Kashchey's successor.

Kal'tsit:
Correct. Mr. Wei...

Kal'tsit:
The Duke of Kashchey knows what you have, and what you're capable of. Talulah may as well.

Kal'tsit:
You can leave this in our hands now, Mr. Wei. We have what it takes to handle this situation.

Kal'tsit:
Like Amiya told you before, the official agreement between Lungmen and Rhodes Island is over.

Kal'tsit:
By now, the Rhodes Island landship has left Lungmen's port. What we do from here on has nothing to do with Lungmen.

Kal'tsit:
Is that acceptable, Amiya?

Amiya:
...Yes.

Amiya:
Mr. Wei. We... won't concern ourselves with the future of Lungmen, or your personal business.

Amiya:
But all this is the result of someone conspiring to exploit the Infected, and we will fight it with all our might.

Amiya:
If you'll permit us to act, and if you can promise you won't act against us in any way——

Amiya:
Then the battle to come is our battle, Rhodes Island's battle.

Wei Yenwu:
I won't rely on the Infected. I don't trust the Infected. The only difference between you and Reunion is that you haven't turned against Lungmen... yet.

Wei Yenwu:
What was Reunion like before? Even if we don't remember, someone does. They weren't anything like this.

Wei Yenwu:
You can dress up your schemes in fancy words, just as Reunion can shout from the rooftops that they will be the ones to deliver the Infected from their fate. In the end, they still ended up being cannon fodder for Ursus.

Wei Yenwu:
In short order, Ursus will snuff out the fire that is Reunion.

Wei Yenwu:
Will you be the next Reunion? Who can say? When will you bare your fangs and turn against us?

Wei Yenwu:
What's more, I doubt you have the strength to deal with Kashchey's successor.

Wei Yenwu:
That Duke of Kashchey... only Lungmen has successfully opposed him over all these years.

Kal'tsit:
Mr. Wei, you intend to personally lead your forces to attack the Chernobog core city, correct?

Wei Yenwu:
Don't make blind conjectures.

Kal'tsit:
What you just told me, Mr. Wei, is revealing. You think you're the only one who can handle this situation.

Kal'tsit:
It's true that Lungmen has the raw power to do it, and you've also overcome the machinations of Ursus.

Kal'tsit:
And this time, you intend to sacrifice yourself to nullify the declaration of war on Ursus.

Kal'tsit:
As Miss Fumizuki said, you feel you've betrayed your principles, and you hope to end it all with your death.

Wei Yenwu:
I've made so many mistakes. My death can't pay for them all. I don't even know who I'd be paying.

Kal'tsit:
Nevertheless, Mr. Wei, are you so certain that, after your death, no one will bear you any ill will?

Wei Yenwu:
Lungmen is strategically important to Yan. Thanks to my protection, it will continue to prosper.

Kal'tsit:
I was referring to Lady Fumizuki.

Amiya:
(Dr. Kal'tsit... Show some tact!)

Fumizuki:
Dr. Kal'tsit?! What are you saying?!

Kal'tsit:
I meant what I said, Mr. Wei. I'm afraid your wife will suffer because of your actions. Even if you're dead, she is your widow. She'll still know everything you knew.

Kal'tsit:
Since someone is forcing you to act against your will, I believe, this sort of thing... is to be expected.

Kal'tsit:
I have a feeling that particular individual won't be so magnanimous.

Fumizuki:
That's enough, Dr. Kal'tsit! You're way out of line. I can't...

Wei Yenwu:
You're saying that even if I do this, I still won't be able to protect Fumizuki.

Kal'tsit:
And it may not end with Miss Fumizuki.

Fumizuki:
...I can go too. Death is the worst that can happen...

Wei Yenwu:
Fumizuki!

Fumizuki:
*Sigh*.

Wei Yenwu:
Speak, Dr. Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
For the sake of your beloved city... And your beloved people...

Kal'tsit:
I am begging you, Lord Wei. Leave this to the experts.

Kal'tsit:
We may be powerless against a standing army, but we know the Infected.

Kal'tsit:
We know what they want, and what they don't.

Kal'tsit:
Only the Infected can face the Infected.

Wei Yenwu:
——

Wei Yenwu:
So, what do you want? Leader of Rhodes Island, Dr. Kal'tsit?

Wei Yenwu:
You're not a charity. Attacking the core city is tantamount to throwing an egg at a boulder. It will be ruinously expensive, and may be utterly futile.

Kal'tsit:
You understand our position, Mr. Wei.

Wei Yenwu:
At this point, it benefits us both to speak plainly.

Amiya:
More than your agreement with our battle plan, Mr. Wei, we need your guarantee.

Amiya:
Considering you may change your mind in the future... We need your promise, for now.

Amiya:
Because I believe that Lungmen and your family, and Madame Ch'en, are worth that promise.

Wei Yenwu:
...

Amiya:
We don't need your money, Miss Fumizuki. Your kindness and your attitude toward the Infected are enough for us to execute this operation free of charge.

Fumizuki:
(Little rabbit...)

Amiya:
Huh?

Fumizuki:
(Gives a thumbs-up)

Amiya:
...??

Wei Yenwu:
I agree. Until the end of the Lungmen-Chernobog conflict, we, Lungmen, will not in any way interfere in Rhodes Island's affairs.

Wei Yenwu:
And it looks to me like the good Dr. Kal'tsit has more yet to say.

Wei Yenwu:
Speak up. I can endure it, for the time being. Because I need Rhodes Island to save one very specific Infected.

Kal'tsit:
...Then, I have another proposal.

Wei Yenwu:
Name your price.

Kal'tsit:
Twenty years ago, Edward Artorius, father of Talulah Artorius, died here in Lungmen.

Kal'tsit:
I would like Mr. Wei to lend us his remains.
