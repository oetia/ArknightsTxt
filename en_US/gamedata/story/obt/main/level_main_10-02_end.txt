Rhodes Island Operator:
Amiya, at this rate, Mr. Thomas is going to get captured by Dublinn again!

Amiya:
......

Rhodes Island Operator:
Are you planning to...

Indra:
That bloody bugger!

Indra:
I'll bring him back.

Dagda:
No.

Indra:
Why are you stopping me? Didn't we go through all the trouble to rescue that bloke?

Dagda:
The situation's changed. We can't blow Siege's cover.

Indra:
So you're just gonna let him go? That's not how the Glasgow Gang does things!

Morgan:
Don't make a ruckus here, either of you.

Morgan:
Vina...

Siege:
Listen to Amiya and the Doctor.

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
Sniper operators, on the enemies holding our mark.

Amiya:
According to Misery's intel and Bagpipe's report, she's the leader of Dublinn's forces inside Londinium.

Amiya:
And one of the instigators of the County Hillock incident.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island doesn't put the blame for Outcast's sacrifice entirely on her shoulders, but it's not just Misery and Bagpipe who hold a grudge against her.

Amiya:
Bagpipe tells us she's very hard to deal with.

Amiya:
We could get into a fight with Dublinn here, rescue Mr. Thomas, and even eliminate Mandragora, a formidable enemy who may pose a significant threat to our future operations.

Amiya:
But...

Rhodes Island Operator:
The Sarkaz are coming!

Amiya:
We're too late.

Amiya:
All squads, continue to conceal yourselves––

Amiya:
Be ready to engage.

Sarkaz Warrior:
What's going on over here? So noisy.

Londinium Citizen:
Ugh...

Dublinn Soldier:
......

Sarkaz Warrior:
Oh, if it isn't you traitorous lot.

Dublinn Soldier:
Don't you dare use that word.

Dublinn Soldier:
We have nothing to do with Victoria now, devil.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Hmph... Who said you could call us that?

Dublinn Soldier:
Hah... A motley band of exiles, taking advantage of the chaos to occupy a city. What made you delusional enough to think yourselves the masters of Londinium?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Haha, don't lump me in with your sorry band, thinking we actually give a damn about Londinium.

Sarkaz Warrior:
The place is shiny and clean, isn't it? Doesn't reek of death. But if you ask me, it'll be more pleasing to the eye once it's burnt to cinders.

Sarkaz Warrior:
The Sarkaz are only here because our King is here.

Amiya:
Their King? The Sarkaz King?

Amiya:
I haven't heard anything about that.

Amiya:
But a lot of intel reports disparate Sarkaz fighters gathering in Londinium from across Terra, and it's not just the mercenaries we're familiar with.

Amiya:
There are... older, stronger powers now hovering around the heart of this city.

Amiya:
Doctor, I can feel it.

Amiya:
Since coming here, with each step closer I take, those emotions flow into the depths of my heart... tangle around my thoughts, and grow stronger and stronger.

Amiya:
I'm fine, Doctor.

Amiya:
It's just that... for a split second, it's as if...

Amiya:
When I heard those Sarkaz mention their 'King,' a wisp of those emotions... sprung up and latched onto me.

Amiya:
I don't think I can give a better description of what I felt...

Amiya:
I'd love to spend some time talking this through with you... but not now.

Amiya:
Even if there were... a Sarkaz King who now controls Londinium, that doesn't change our mission.

Amiya:
We came here to prevent a war.

Amiya:
We need to figure out exactly what they're doing, and what they're trying to do.

Amiya:
––And that has nothing to do with what Theresis decides to call himself.

Sarkaz Warrior:
So, can we skip past the shitty pleasantries, Dublinn?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Turn over the man you captured.

Dublinn Soldier:
Why should I?

Sarkaz Warrior:
We'll take good care of your old home.

Dublinn Soldier:
You bastard––!

Mandragora:
Stop.

Dublinn Soldier:
Captain...!

Mandragora:
Not just you. You too, Sarkaz.

Sarkaz Warrior:
I know who you are, Feline. You're their commander.

Sarkaz Warrior:
But why should I listen to you?

Mandragora:
Because I've been to the Palace of Westhaleg.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Haha, we've all heard the story. You wanted an audience with His Majesty, but he had you escorted out.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Do you really think you mean anything to the Sarkaz?

Mandragora:
......

Dublinn Soldier:
Captain, why do we just sit here and let the devils mock us?

Dublinn Soldier:
I can't take it anymore. Ever since we came to Londinium, we've had to live with this inferior race—

Mandragora:
Not one more word.

Dublinn Soldier:
We can go back and bring this up with the Leader...

Mandragora:
I said, not one more word!

Mandragora:
Sarkaz, no matter how hard you try to provoke me, I'm not leaving.

Mandragora:
We are your guests, as the one you call 'His Majesty' and his privy council agreed.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Do you really want to find out how the Sarkaz deal with rowdy 'guests?'

Mandragora:
Well, at least one of us understands proper etiquette.

Mandragora:
We promised your regent and your generals that Dublinn's troops would not set foot into Central Londinium.

Mandragora:
Likewise, you should not be detaining me here, Sarkaz.

Mandragora:
Or, do you devils struggle to keep your word? Can you even spell 'trustworthy?'

Sarkaz Warrior:
Hah, you uppity Feline... Isn't the fact that I haven't chopped you into pieces right here and now already proof that I'm honoring our little pretend friendship?

Sarkaz Warrior:
If a Sarkaz ever forgot his objective and started picking fights, he'd be found dead in a bar near a warzone pretty quick.

Sarkaz Warrior:
We're here to root out some bottom feeders. These nobodies haven't learned their place yet. They're sneaking around, making a mess of our work––

Amiya:
By the sound of things, they're not looking for Mr. Thomas either.

Amiya:
Could that be the friends the Messenger mentioned, the ones who can help us with our operation?

Amiya:
The Sarkaz certainly would call them an enemy.

Amiya:
If they really are right here, maybe we could help them...

Horn:
The line stopped moving.

Horn:
I hear fighting... the Sarkaz must've gotten into a row with someone.

Londinium Citizen?:
Lieutenant, I saw their uniforms... it's Dublinn!

Horn:
Her.

Londinium Citizen?:
The Dublinn caster?

Londinium Citizen?:
She... She's a scary one...

Londinium Citizen?:
She's killed some of our people. She impales them on stone pillars that come out of nowhere. Her methods are even more brutal than the Sarkaz!

Horn:
I know.

Londinium Citizen?:
Lieutenant, have you fought her too? What am I even saying? You've saved so many from Dublinn, you must've beaten her...

Horn:
I lost.

Londinium Citizen?:
But you... still managed to get away from her with your life. That's already amazing enough.

Horn:
I'm still not exactly sure why she didn't kill me on the spot... but I have my guesses.

Horn:
At the Barracks outside Londinium, I saw them having secret meetings with a count's Messenger.

Horn:
I figured she must've shown me deliberately.

Horn:
Or maybe it wasn't her. Someone like her would have no way of knowing that my grandfather and the count's father served together. They were very close.

Horn:
And the count himself... If I recall correctly, was squire to a duke.

Londinium Citizen?:
Lieutenant...?

Horn:
Sorry, I shouldn't be saying all this.

Horn:
During the long period of time I was hiding in the dark bowels of this city, I... got used to talking to the metal crabs. They didn't have much to say back.

Horn:
I didn't have to worry about my words casting a shadow over anyone else.

Horn:
Some things, I just had to say to myself so I wouldn't forget them.

Londinium Citizen?:
I didn't mean to interrupt you, Lieutenant!

Londinium Citizen?:
I'd actually like to hear more. For the longest time, I've been wanting to know who's pulling the strings up there, causing us all this misery!

Horn:
The duke I was thinking of isn't even in Londinium right now. Or rather, I should say... he never cared a lick about the vacant throne in the city.

Horn:
If he really were secretly supporting Dublinn, that would answer a lot of questions. But at the same time, it would also greatly complicate the crisis we have on our hands...

Horn:
Listen to me. Everything I've said to you up to this point is just baseless speculation. If you want to hear more, we'll continue another time.

Horn:
Provided... you're willing to follow me into the shadows.

Londinium Citizen?:
What are we going to do now?

Horn:
Right now... we need to find an opportunity to escape.

Horn:
Dublinn has been trying to get something from the Sarkaz. It might be one individual or several, which is why they've set up in Sudean.

Horn:
In addition to troops like you, hunted by the Sarkaz, they've captured a good lot of civilians with some connection to the Sarkaz.

Horn:
Whatever Mandragora is trying to accomplish...

Horn:
As long as it creates conflict between Dublinn and the Sarkaz, it'll work in our favor.

Londinium Citizen?:
Sounds like you have a plan.

Horn:
Robben, did you make sure to hide the crossbow I gave you? Up your sleeves, right?

Londinium Citizen?:
Of course, Lieutenant!

Horn:
Aim at that Dublinn soldier, the one closest to the Sarkaz.

Amiya:
It looks like Dublinn isn't backing down.

Amiya:
The Sarkaz have a limit to their patience. This is going to boil over into a fight, sooner or later.

Amiya:
Doctor, we're going to have to use our backup plan.

Sarkaz Warrior:
C'mon, turn him over and you all get to walk out of here alive. Let's make things easy for each other, why don't we?

Dublinn Soldier:
...Captain, shouldn't we...

Mandragora:
No.

Dublinn Soldier:
I don't understand...

Mandragora:
No means no.

Dublinn Soldier:
Even if it fractures our relationship with the Sarkaz?

Mandragora:
You heard what they had to say.

Mandragora:
When... have we ever been friends?

Sarkaz Warrior:
There you go. Those are your words, not mine.

Sarkaz Warrior:
––Formation! Round up these Dublinn wretches!

Mandragora:
He is absolutely critical to Dublinn. Non-negotiable.

Mandragora:
If we can't bring him with us, our only option is to kill him here.

Londinium Citizen:
Waaaah!

Mandragora:
Shut your trap.

Mandragora:
Actually, our other option... is to kill all these Sarkaz.

???:
Isn't it about time we make our entrance?

???:
Hold on, we're still calibrating the aerial coordinates.

???:
Look, if we don't act now, someone's gonna get killed.

???:
Give me a sec... Seventeen meters in a straight line... Sixteen... Fifteen...

???:
Best to get a bit closer or you might have trouble aiming, right?

???:
No can do. They'll spot us if I get any closer!

???:
Rock-5, you're up!

Horn:
That's our cue.

Horn:
Robben, now!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Hey, hey, hey–– Gah!

Dublinn Soldier:
Urgh...

Sarkaz Warrior:
What's the meaning of this?!

Dublinn Soldier:
The hell are you talking about? You're the ones who tried to snipe us––

Sarkaz Warrior:
Fight back!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Those who spill Sarkaz blood will pay the blood debt with interest!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Don't let a single one out of here alive!

Mandragora:
Remember, you started this.

Mandragora:
––With me. Slaughter every last Sarkaz.

Mandragora:
Don't let a single one live to tell the tale.

Mandragora:
The devil leadership mustn't learn what happened here today.

Londinium Citizen:
Aaaaaaaahhhh––!

Londinium Citizen:
Save me! Someone, anyone!

Rhodes Island Operator:
Amiya, these civilians have nowhere to run... It's not just Mr. Thomas, so many are going to get caught in the crossfire!

Rhodes Island Operator:
Neither the Sarkaz nor Dublinn have any regard for civilian lives!

Siege:
......

Siege:
Doctor, Amiya, I'm sorry, but I can't just stand by and let this happen.

Siege:
I just can't.

Amiya:
I understand.

Amiya:
All operators, there's been a change in plans!

Amiya:
All non-combat personnel are to remain hidden. All combat personnel, save as many lives as you can. But mind your own safety!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Another bolt from behind?

Sarkaz Warrior:
It came from those ones, in civilian clothes... They're carrying unauthorized weapons!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Something's not right. We've got more hostiles in the elevator!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Hah... Looks like we've grabbed the pest's tail.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Turns out the rebels ARE here––

Sarkaz Warrior:
Report this to General Manfred right away!
