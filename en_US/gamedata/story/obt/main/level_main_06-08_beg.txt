Ch'en:
Move out.

L. G. D. Operator:
But we're really not familiar with the layout here. I'm worried... what if the Infected resist our operations?

Ch'en:
Relax. I know the area. Just follow my orders.

L. G. D. Operator:
Yes, Sir!

L. G. D. Operator:
Sir, bad news: intelligence reports Reunion is moving with some degree of organization again. It seems they've found another commander.

L. G. D. Operator:
And... and they've reencrypted their communication channels. We can't intercept them anymore!

Ch'en:
Could they have joined up with the units in the slums?

Ch'en:
Impossible. Rhodes Island should already have dealt with the situation there. There's no risk of us getting boxed in.

Ch'en:
Strange...

Swire:
Ah Ch'en, I'm ready to——

Ch'en:
A transmission?

Ch'en:
'Little Miss,' would you mind giving me the room?

Swire:
How do you work it out so you're busy every time I have something for you?

Swire:
Is that spy of yours back on the grid?

Ch'en:
I said give me the room. And get me some finballs while you're out.

Swire:
I'm not a kid, you know.

Ch'en:
...This is Ch'en.

???:
We have another Reunion element up from the lower levels of the slums.

???:
Infected called Yeti Squad. It seems they have the ability to collapse buildings and destroy infrastructure.

???:
Tread carefully.

Ch'en:
...Understood.

Ch'en:
Only-1, Lungmen's special forces are operating in the slums. We are at the moment incapable of stopping them. Exercise caution.

???:
Roger.

Ch'en:
...Only-1, why did you drop out of contact?

???:
I had some things on my mind.

???:
It's clear to me now. I'm leaving Lungmen to you.

Ch'en:
What? I don't understand.

???:
Me, now? I don't belong here.

Ch'en:
Only-1!

???:
I'm going to take some of Lungmen's Infected. The L. G. D. can't protect them. The city doesn't care about them.

???:
In other words, this city isn't at all what you think it is.

Ch'en:
Nine! You're under orders!

Nine:
I haven't been with the L. G. D. for over three years.

Nine:
And actually it was me giving orders to you.

Ch'en:
Nine...!

Nine:
Those special forces you're talking about? I think I've seen them around.

Nine:
I thought too much of this city. Goodbye, Ch'en.

Nine:
Oh, right. Don't go snooping around the sewers.

Ch'en:
......

Ch'en:
Was I too loud?

Swire:
You're pretty loud. I think the whole block heard you.

Ch'en:
And yet I'm still not as loud as you.

Swire:
Hey, Ah Ch'en, get over here.

Ch'en:
......

Swire:
Have a seat.

Ch'en:
Wow, Miss Swire squatting on a dirty street corner. You're not afraid to soil your clothes?

Swire:
Certainly not! What makes you think I'd worry about a thing like that?

Swire:
I was just about to give that stinky sewer rat another call.

Swire:
I may not come here often, but I'm pretty sure those special forces are up to no good.

Ch'en:
Have you met Lin? From the slums?

Swire:
I have. He's a nice old man. Nicer than my grandpa anyway.

Ch'en:
They call him the 'Rat King.'

Swire:
The men behind the curtain aren't all like such. But he's really a good person.

Swire:
I never thought Yühsia would turn out like this. She was such a shy and timid girl, the kind who would always hide behind you.

Ch'en:
I don't think she's changed. She just... took on responsibility. Maybe the kind she couldn't handle.

Swire:
It wouldn't do any good to tell her that. We're between a rock and hard place here.

Ch'en:
I can't say I understand what's going on between her and her father, but I know she's not so cold-blooded.

Swire:
So I'm gonna call her.

Ch'en:
......

Ch'en:
That report I just got may be of use to us.

Swire:
What do you mean?

Ch'en:
A Reunion group with special powers has entered the slums, and they're able to command other Reunion elements.

Ch'en:
And I'm the only one who knows. Well, now it's the two of us, I guess.

Swire:
What are you thinking?

Ch'en:
We steer the raincoats into them.

Ch'en:
Aside from the group left to help the L. G. D. clean up the new-type Infected, there's also quite a few of those special forces with us in the slums.

Ch'en:
And the situation is: we don't know their distribution, we have no way to guard against them, and have no idea what they might do.

Ch'en:
But with Lin Yühsia's help, we can guide them into that Reunion team.

Swire:
Force them out? Show them to the whole L. G. D.?

Ch'en:
The L. G. D., sure, but also Rhodes Island.

Swire:
You trust them so much?

Ch'en:
They chase their objectives harder than any group I've ever seen. They're even more dedicated than the L. G. D.

Ch'en:
And who else are we going to trust?

Swire:
You've got stones, I'll give you that.

Ch'en:
Ordinary Lungmenites don't know Lin, they don't know your grandfather, they don't even really know Wei Yenwu, let alone any chambers of commerce or whatever behind the scenes.

Ch'en:
They just trust the L. G. D. None of those players would dare disband the L. G. D., and leave us with the regular old police.

Ch'en:
Then you add in the outsiders... And there's no way they'll want to take over.

Swire:
They'll fire you though.

Ch'en:
Whoop-de-doo.

Swire:
Then let's wrap up this one last job! Next time, their patrol route goes right into the slums.

Ch'en:
You can get Lin on board?

Swire:
As long as we look after this place, Lin will work with us.

Ch'en:
One more thing...

Swire:
What's that?

Ch'en:
Did you know we have three guests?

Lin Yühsia:
......

Lin Yühsia:
What is it?

Swire:
Listen up, stinky rat, I've got news for you. There's a Reunion unit we can't hold. We need your team's help.

Lin Yühsia:
Impossible. What are you trying to pull?

Swire:
Have I ever lied to you?

Lin Yühsia:
You said we'd go to the same secondary school, only for you to run off to Victoria.

Swire:
......

Swire:
I'm sorry. Really, truly sorry.

Lin Yühsia:
Forget it. I don't care.

Swire:
Yühsia, your dad has done so much for Lungmen. We don't want to lose this place, and the people here can't lose us either.

Lin Yühsia:
Liar. You're coming here?

Lin Yühsia:
You'll come to the slums?

Swire:
......Ch'en will.

Lin Yühsia:
You really are a terrible liar. What business have I with her?

Swire:
For whatever reason, your dad wasn't able to resolve the conflict between the Infected and the normal people, but Ch'en can.

Swire:
Ch'en and your father will rebuild the slums together.

Swire:
They're working to turn it into a place where all kinds of people can live, to the point that we won't even be able to call it the slums anymore.

Swire:
Think about it... Even though most Lungmenites don't live here, they've been coming here a lot in the past few years, haven't they?

Swire:
Soon, we won't need any slums.

Lin Yühsia:
What?

Swire:
We haven't been able to solve the Infected crisis, but I know... We can make this a better place.

Swire:
They'll be Lungmen's downtown Districts 22 to 29. No longer 'slums.'

Swire:
This city was built on the many, many different kinds of people all coming together to make it what it is today.

Swire:
Lungmen can't afford to lose anyone.

Lin Yühsia:
Yawn. How boring. You've become as boring as Ch'en.

Swire:
Yühsia...

Swire:
Look, I'm not trying to make a soap opera here.

Lin Yühsia:
Where is that Reunion unit?

Swire:
Oh?

Lin Yühsia:
I won't ask again.

Ch'en:
Amiya, have you entered the slums?

Ch'en:
We have a bit of a situation here. Let me fill you in.
