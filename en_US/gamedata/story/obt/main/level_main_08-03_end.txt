Infected Patrol Unit:
Nggaaaaah!

Infected Patrol Unit:
Aahh... aaaaaahh!

Talulah:
......

Alina:
Talulah...! You... ngh...!

Alina:
Is that fire your doing!? You're the one who set them alight... guh!

Talulah:
Alina, I'm sorry. This will surely mean even worse to come for the village. But I just couldn't stand it.

Talulah:
I just couldn't stand this sort of...

Talulah:
...Alina?

Facing her, Talulah was taken aback. Alina met her gaze with an expression she'd never seen her wear before.

Alina:
There's a fire in your eyes.

Alina:
I knew from the moment you came to this village, you'd never be willing just to stay here.

Alina:
You came from somewhere. Where you came from, you'll go back to. This village can't hold you.

Talulah:
I won't go back. Don't look at me like that...

Alina:
But within your eyes, truly, there's a fire.

Alina:
You wanted to set something alight, burn it away, you thought none of this was how it should be, you bore it until you could bear it no more...

Alina:
It shouldn't have been now, Talulah. Not now.

Alina:
The villagers are innocent. Your one flare of anger only served to hurt them.

Infected Patrol Unit:
What happened—oh, God! What the hell is going on?! Who!? Who did this!?

Old Woman:
Talulah! Talulah! Run, now, run! And don't look back! Don't ever come back!

Old Woman:
Blessings, your Majesty, bless this girl like my daughter, bless her to live on, bless her so she can live on!

Alina:
Talulah, we need to go!

Talulah:
No... those hideous patrolmen!

Alina:
We're Infected, but none of the villagers are!

Talulah:
...What did you say?

Alina:
I'm Infected too, Talulah. I'm Infected too.

Alina:
*Pant*, *pant*... This is... where we'd planned to move. We had everything ready... but...

Talulah:
They... The old man was...

Talulah:
We can't let them do this again... we can't let them...

Alina:
He saved you, saved me, saved the whole village.

Alina:
You threw... his whole plan into disarray.

Talulah:
What do you even mean? The villagers were the ones who—

Talulah:
...Wait. You mean the one who turned him in... was...

Alina:
It was his idea. That way, the Patrol wouldn't come again, and hopefully, that would've been that.

Alina:
No matter how much strength you have, you can't resist the Patrol Unit.

Talulah:
I can.

Alina:
And then? What if the Gendarmerie came? What if the city's garrisons and all the nobles' soldiers came?

Talulah:
We just don't have the firepower. Once we've accumulated enough strength...

Talulah:
Because it's not right. It's not right! We can't just look on like this!

Talulah:
All these wicked things right before our eyes, but we turn away, just to save ourselves?! That's not right!

Talulah:
...That's selfish. Heartless, even.

Talulah:
If righteousness can only be upheld by greater and greater violence, how can it even be considered righteous?

Alina:
I can't answer these questions of yours, Talulah. You've studied more than I have, that I know.

Alina:
But someone died today in the village. And no more ought to die.

Alina:
You're so clever. You can understand that.

Alina:
Now, go, Talulah!

Talulah:
...I'll be back.

Alina:
Tell yourself that, Talulah. Tell yourself that.
