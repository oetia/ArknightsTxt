4 days after the Chernobog rescue mission

PRTS:
Good morning, Dr. {@nickname}. You have currently been sleeping for 99999----

PRTS:
----9999 hours.

PRTS:
Although your reluctance to leave bed is not beyond reason, your presence is urgently needed at the operations command room.

PRTS:
Furthermore, here is some medical advice from Dr. Kal'tsit: Please keep the windows open to maintain a source of fresh air, and spend some time on the deck to maintain healthy levels of Vitamin D.

Amiya:
Ah, Doctor! Good morning.

Dobermann:
So you made it, Dr. {@nickname}.

Amiya:
Doctor, are you feeling better now?

Amiya:
You looked like you were still in pain and and couldn't move around well yesterday.

Amiya:
I'm perfectly fine and full of energy today!

Amiya:
After all, we still have other missions to take care of...

Amiya:
So the sooner we can start preparing, the better. Doctor, you should get used to having to shift gears quickly here.

Dobermann:
Doctor,

Dobermann:
Even though we sustained heavy losses in Chernobog, we gained a lot of information about Reunion and, more importantly, got you out alive.

Dobermann:
Based on the negotiations we had yesterday, the closest mobile city to us, Lungmen, has offered us a cooperation pact and agreed to exchange information with us.

Dobermann:
We have some evidence that Reunion might be targeting Lungmen next.

Dobermann:
We'll have to wait for Dr. Kal'tsit's permission first before we can get the rest of the information. She's still stationed within Lungmen.

Amiya:
Lungmen has granted us permission to temporary camp near the city. They've also agreed to compensate a portion of our losses and expenditures during the operation.

Amiya:
In exchanges, Rhodes Island is expected to help defend the city's outskirts.

Amiya:
But the reason why I called for you so early is...

Dobermann:
Let me explain it, Amiya.

Dobermann:
Last night, we discovered another wave of Chernobog survivors making their way towards Lungmen. They're expected to get there in the afternoon.

Dobermann:
We'll be expected to safeguard the outskirts of District 5 just like the last few days. Only this time, there might be more Reunion members mixed into the group.

Dobermann:
Because the situation is a bit different, we'll need to discuss some new tactics with you before beginning the operation.

Amiya:
Anyway, Doctor, there's a lot to get through today, so...

Amiya:
Let's do our best!

Dobermann:
In any case...

Dobermann:
Both of you, please complete your combat preparations. Doctor, once you've decided on your squad assignments, please let the operators know so that they also have time to prepare.

Dobermann:
We'll set out 15 minutes after you finish your drills.

Dobermann:
Oh, and make sure you're not late this time.
