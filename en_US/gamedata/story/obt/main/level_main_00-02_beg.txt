Dobermann:
...This is way beyond my expectations...

Dobermann:
Explosions, rioting, fires, fighting in the streets...

Dobermann:
Has Chernobog completely fallen into chaos?

TV Host:
Thanks to the swift response and teamwork of the Chernobog Military Police...

TV Host:
...the situation is largely under control. The incidents in most areas have already been contained.

TV Host:
Currently, the Military Police has already surrounded the thugs who had taken Vaschuk Prospect.

TV Host:
As you can see, this senseless violence is about to be put to an end.

TV Host:
Please do not panic. Stay indoors, and await another victory for Chernobog...

TV Host:
May the glory of Ursus bless the Emperor and his people!

Reunion Member:
...

Ursus Guard:
Curse them... where the hell did they get those kinds of equipment and weapons?!

Ursus Captain:
Don't get scared! Cowards in armor are still just cowards! They're just a bunch of untrained thugs!

Ursus Guard:
But... there are so many of them...! !

Ursus Captain:
We've already taken out forces three times the size of ours! Just do it again, and the battle will be over!

Reunion Member:
Enough with the nonsense, Chernobog scum!

Ursus Captain:
You filth think you can stand against us? !

Ursus Captain:
Exile and hard labor are too good for your kind. We should have executed the lot of you the moment you were captured!

Reunion Member:
How dare you...! !

Ursus Guard:
Ugh...! They're rushing us again. Our front lines won't hold out much longer!

Ursus Captain:
For the Emperor! Stand your ground! !

Ursus Guard:
I... I can't do it anymore...!

Ursus Captain:
Anyone who turns tail will be executed on the spot!

Ursus Guard:
*cough* *cough*...

Guard:
We have to...

Dobermann:
Stay put! We must not expose ourselves yet!

Amiya:
The Ursus guards... are getting overwhelmed by Reunion?

Dobermann:
Hmph... What they're broadcasting on television can't be farther from the truth.

Dobermann:
Even in this situation, the Chernobog authorities are still playing their games.

Dobermann:
But things are getting worse for us too. We can't expect to sneak out anymore.

Amiya:
Terrible road conditions and enemy blockades... We won't be able to use our own vehicles anymore...

Dobermann:
That's right. The rescue team must be large enough to clear out any Reunion members that block our way.

Dobermann:
Splitting up any further would be suicide.

Guard:
These Ursus guards...

Guard:
They might look powerful because they're well-equipped, but Reunion...

Guard:
Reunion clearly has an overwhelming advantage in numbers and morale!

Dobermann:
This is nothing like when we first investigated Chernobog...

Dobermann:
When we sneaked in, the quantity, distribution, and status of Chernobog's guards and military were in a very bizarre state.

Dobermann:
Back then, we just couldn't figure out why.

Guard:
Had Reunion already destroyed most of Chernobog's defenses at that point?

Dobermann:
Though I don't have any proof, if Reunion has grown powerful enough to launch such a large-scale operation...

Dobermann:
... All I can say is that I feel lucky those guards are being surrounded, instead of us.

Dobermann:
Of course, we must be vigilant of our surroundings. By the time we end up in a crisis, it'll already be too late--

Amiya:
... Doctor, hurry and gather your teams.

Amiya:
Our scouts have discovered Reunion forces. They're about to come in contact with our rescue team!

Dobermann:
For now, being cautious is the only advantage we can get.

Reunion Member:
Hmm?

Reunion Member:
Why is there an armed force here? !

Dobermann:
All teams, prepare for combat! Don't give them any chance to retaliate!
