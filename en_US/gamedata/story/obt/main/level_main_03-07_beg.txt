Franka:
We've broken through the first defensive line!

Reunion Member:
What are the casters doing?!

Reunion Member:
Even though there's only one enemy in the vanguard...

Reunion Member:
Why are they just watching her tear us apart?!

Reunion Member:
Hurry, hurry! Take her out!

Liskarm:
Franka! You're getting out of range!

Liskarm:
I can't... give you cover from here!

Franka:
Do I look that reckless to you?

Liskarm:
Watch your four o'clock!

Franka:
Liskarm, it's time for your debut!

Franka:
Be a sweetie and block the enemy's ranged attacks, won't you?

Liskarm:
Tsk...

Reunion Member:
Quick! Faster!

Reunion Member:
Focus down the one with the sword first!

Reunion Member:
Did we get her--?

Reunion Member:
...Huh?

Hoshiguma:
Don't even think about it.

Hoshiguma:
You call those attacks, or are you just throwing sticks and stones?

Reunion Member:
Woah!!

Reunion Member:
Wh-where'd this one come from?!

Franka:
I owe you one, Cap'n!

Hoshiguma:
My pleasure.

Hoshiguma:
However, Franka, your task was to launch a feint attack.

Hoshiguma:
Instead, you fought your way all the way here. You have a huge target over your head now. Is that fine with you?

Franka:
Sure is, after all, I have a trusty partner after all!

Liskarm:
Ugh... Gahh...

Liskarm:
Franka! You charged way too far ahead!

Franka:
See? She caught up to us.

Liskarm:
I'm not used to this kind of stuff...! Why are you making me charge headlong into the enemy? I don't get it!

Hoshiguma:
...Huh?

Reunion Member:
Curses...

Reunion Member:
L.G.D. and Rhodes Island are working together!

Reunion Member:
There's no way we can defend this place...

Reunion Member:
We can't afford to hesitate. It's do or die. Everyone, chaaarge!

Liskarm:
The enemies are rushing straight at us!

Reunion Member:
Dieeeee!

Hoshiguma:
If you plan to resist, you leave me with no choice. Don't take it personally.

Reunion Member:
You...!

Hoshiguma:
...!

Reunion Member:
Aaaaaaaaghhh!!

Liskarm:
Madam, you're... quite strong.

Liskarm:
That Reunion fellow... Not his lucky day.

Hoshiguma:
They've got some nerve to attack us like that...

Hoshiguma:
I feel bad for him.

Hoshiguma:
They should apologize to everyone who fell by their hands.

Amiya:
Inspector!

Hoshiguma:
I'm glad to see that you're all fine.

Amiya:
We've collapsed their flank! The next step is to launch our all-out assault.

Hoshiguma:
Fine by me.

Texas:
Everything seems to be going smoothly.

Hoshiguma:
That probably won't last for much longer. The enemies have set up many obstacles, and are doing a good job of staying hidden.

Hoshiguma:
Amiya, be prepared for a hard fight.

Hoshiguma:
Dr. {@nickname}, make sure you scout things out thoroughly and protect your squads!

Amiya:
Of course!

Amiya:
Everyone, let's go rescue Misha together!
