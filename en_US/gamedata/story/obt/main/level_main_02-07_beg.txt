Misha:
Nngh...

Exusiai:
What's wrong with her...?

Amiya:
It's an acute symptom of Oripathy!

Amiya:
But it's only been a week...!

Liskarm:
There's also an acute form of Oripathy?

Liskarm:
Franka, which type is yours?

Franka:
What, are you concerned about me?

Liskarm:
Amiya, if Franka passes away, I hope that Rhodes Island will cremate her.

Franka:
Hey!

Franka:
That's mean, Liskarm!

Liskarm:
You're the one who's always talking about passing the infection on to me!

Amiya:
Aha... Ahaha...!

Amiya:
The difference between the acute and chronic types is a rather complicated topic.

Amiya:
However, Misha's condition is very dangerous.

Amiya:
If we don't do anything, this condition will become life threatening very quickly.

Amiya:
All we can do is give her some emergency treatment...

Amiya:
But we must control Misha's symptoms as quickly as possible.

Amiya:
We have to make this clear to Lungmen. After this ends, we have to bring Misha with us back to Rhodes Island.

Amiya:
This is part of our responsibility.

Exusiai:
Um...

Exusiai:
Is she... going to explode soon?

Exusiai:
Oww! That hurt! Why'd you hit me...

Texas:
Watch your mouth.

Exusiai:
Ughh...

Franka:
If I'm going to explode one day, I'll make sure to crawl up to you.

Exusiai:
I'm sorry! Miss Franka, please forgive me for everything I've done!

Franka:
Pfft...

Liskarm:
Let's transfer her to a safe place first.

Liskarm:
By the way, we seem to have a situation behind us.

Infected:
What are you doing? ! Get out! !

Reunion Member:
We're all fellow Infected here, don't make us resort to violence! Get out of our way!

Infected:
You've already destroyed our home, and now you're trying to get the L.G.D. here?! Forget it! !

Infected:
You little...! You ignorant fool, get out of the way! !

Infected:
Argh!!

Infected:
Now you've done it!

Franka:
(Are we going to step in?)

Franka:
(We seem to have finally lost them. But if we intervene now, we're going to be exposed.)

Liskarm:
(Is this going to get in the way of our mission? If so, how serious are the consequences going to be?)

Franka:
(Of course this is going to interfere, but...)

Franka:
(It won't be that serious, right?)

Amiya:
Let's do it, then.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island's unequivocal mission to save the Infected, as long as the situation permits.

Franka:
Mmhm, good.

Franka:
I knew following you was the right decision.

Amiya:
What do you mean by that, Miss Franka?

Franka:
Don't worry, don't worry! I was just complimenting you!

Liskarm:
She probably thinks that she can get along well with you.

Franka:
How do you know me so well?

Liskarm:
Probably because you're so annoying?

Amiya:
Ugh...

Franka:
It's time to teach these thugs a lesson.

Amiya:
Yes.

Amiya:
Be careful of the enemies who can jump between buildings.

Amiya:
In addition, make sure to protect Lungmen's Infected civilians!

Texas:
That's asking for a lot.

Texas:
--But, I'll handle it.

Exusiai:
All right, let's go!

Exusiai:
Dr. {@nickname}, make sure to lead me and Texas well!
