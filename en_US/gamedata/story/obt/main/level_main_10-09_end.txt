Hoederer:
Didn't think I would ever see you surprised like this.

Hoederer:
I gave you a hint, after all.

W:
That rock? Very funny.

W:
I thought...

Hoederer:
Who did you think would come? Manfred?

W:
I'm thinking Theresis must be getting senile if he let you live. You even get to roam around Londinium like this?

W:
I thought you guys were long dead, since I haven't heard anything from you in ages.

Hoederer:
......

W:
Well... you know what they say about assuming? See, you were right. I've become sentimental, almost forgot we're mercs.

Hoederer:
Your detonator hand slowed down, W.

W:
And your hand isn't trembling this time.

Hoederer:
What about those mercenaries you brought from Reunion? Did you really come alone?

W:
Why would I bring them? So that they could get bought out by the Regent, like you?

Hoederer:
Looks like you care about them. No wonder I didn't see any familiar faces.

W:
Speak for yourself. I saw lots of old friends in Londinium.

Hoederer:
You really like headhunting under my nose, don't you?

W:
Let me guess, Schwab is dead, isn't he? You killed him, didn't you, Hoederer? He knew you longer than he knew me, right?

W:
Did your hand tremble when you killed an old friend? One who carried you on his back for an entire day, dodging dozens of Theresis's killers?

Hoederer:
You're remembering it wrong. He was gone by the Battle for Rhodes Island.

W:
Alright, you've always had a better memory than me for the people we fought with.

W:
I've always wanted to ask... does it make you feel better to remember the dead?

Hoederer:
......

W:
I don't think so. I can see it in your eyes. Your dreams haunt you now more than ever.

Hoederer:
I've known you for as long as you've known me.

Hoederer:
You're only trying to hide your own feelings when move to provoke me like that.

W:
Ha, like you'd know.

Hoederer:
In the old days, you would have thrown out those useless resistance fighters as bait.

Hoederer:
If someone told me that W volunteered to be the rear guard, I would have told them to find a funnier joke.

Hoederer:
Did your time in Chernobog drive you mad, W?

Hoederer:
Did Talulah burn your brains out, or are you seeing the shadows of the dead?

W:
The mad never admit their madness, right? How do you know I'm the one who's mad?

W:
Schwab's head isn't enough to buy Theresis's trust. What was the price you had to pay?

W:
Could it have been her? Don't tell me...

Hoederer:
Don't even say it.

W:
Oh? There's a reaction.

Hoederer:
We've done all we could.

Hoederer:
You were too slow, W.

W:
Did I hear that right? Are you looking for an excuse for your screw-ups? Who was it who told me he had a plan for everything?

Hoederer:
When do you think I lost my eye?

W:
You don't mean that Ines...

Hoederer:
Yes, she's dead.

W:
Again?

W:
I'm not...

Hoederer:
Mercenaries pay a price for breaching trust. I've paid mine.

Horn:
We're out.

Robben:
We've been lucky, haven't we?

Robben:
The Sarkaz got drawn to the explosions in the south. The ones guarding the interrogation room got taken out by Dublinn.

Horn:
Nothing good comes of relying on luck in battle.

???:
Ha. Did you think you would have lived this long, if not for lady luck?

Horn:
—

Prisoner:
W-Who's she? Did they escape from the interrogation room too? Are they friends?

Horn:
Enemies.

Horn:
(Aim.)

Horn:
(But hold your fire.)

Mandragora:
Can't talk without your crossbow raised, soldier? Don't think I didn't know you only got out by following us.

Horn:
You want me to thank you? Then you'd better take a trip with me to the hardest prison in Londinium.

Mandragora:
......

Mandragora:
I'll give you credit.

Mandragora:
You're not like the nobles that seep oil from every pore.

Mandragora:
They're the ones who kneel before anyone to cling to their way of life. Sarkaz or Dublinn... it makes no difference to them.

Mandragora:
You, though... you just won't give up. You're like flies, getting in my way no matter where I go.

Horn:
That's my line.

Mandragora:
Why you...!

???:
*Cough* *cough* Mandragora...

Horn:
Your friend's in pretty bad shape.

Mandragora:
Same to those soldiers behind you.

Horn:
Looks like we're both in a hurry.

Mandragora:
......

Mandragora:
It's a shame that I don't have time for you today.

Horn:
Suits me just fine.

Horn:
Make way.

Mandragora:
......

Mandragora:
Let's go.

Mandragora:
By the way, soldier—

Horn:
Huh?

Mandragora:
You had better not die at the hands of the Sarkaz...

Mandragora:
Before I have the chance to impale you with my rock.

Robben:
Whew... they're gone.

Horn:
Good. Save your ammo for the Sarkaz.

Robben:
Do you mean...?

Horn:
Don't you think it's too easy?

Horn:
Whoever Dublinn took from the interrogation room, I doubt the Sarkaz would let them go so easily.

Horn:
Or us, for that matter.

Amiya:
Do you have everyone, Lady Heidi?

Heidi:
Yes, Amiya. They're all here.

Amiya:
Careful!

Amiya:
Let the weakest go first. We'll take care of any pursuing mercenaries.

Amiya:
Feist, can you still fight?

Feist:
Of course.

Feist:
Hang on tight, Bill. Things could get bumpy.

Closure:
More enemies ahead! They must have come in from another entrance!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Target found!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Over here! Get them!

Morgan:
Hey, don't run too fast. Got to keep a pair of eyes in the back of your head when moving.

Dagda:
A few got away.

Morgan:
Still not enough?

Morgan:
Get that caster first. Don't let him cast any Arts on our wounded.

Amiya:
Thank goodness you are back.

Morgan:
We aren't late to the party, are we?

Morgan:
Whew... Doctor, you didn't tell me there was only one fighter meeting up with us.

Morgan:
You know, Doctor, the more I learn about Rhodes Island, the more mysterious it seems.

Morgan:
But at the end of the day, the most mysterious one is always you.

Morgan:
You always have a card up your sleeve, don't you?

Morgan:
On this point, we're the same.

Morgan:
It looks like the Sarkaz have been drawn over here. But we didn't see many souls on the way.

Morgan:
The ones holding off the enemies inside... I'm worried about them.

Amiya:
I'm worried about W...

Morgan:
W? The one who made such an impression on all those operators at Chernobog?

Amiya:
Er, yeah.

Morgan:
Rhodes Island really IS filled with talent.

Amiya:
We have a... temporary understanding.

Amiya:
Doctor, I felt something eerie in her gaze when she said she was looking for Lady Heidi.

Amiya:
Her emotions can be unusual, but there are times that she doesn't try to hide them. Her eyes don't lie at times like that.

Amiya:
The last time I saw that look from her was when she was yelling at me for the codes to stop the core city.

Amiya:
Is she still hiding something?

Amiya:
Alright... I trusted her once, I'll trust her again.

W:
Huff... huff...

Hoederer:
You're bleeding a lot.

W:
You've got a few holes in you.

Hoederer:
You should have hidden another bomb on yourself, like you used to. That way, you'd at least have a chance to take me down with you.

W:
*Cough*... Hoederer...

W:
How much is my head worth? Enough to buy a small house in Londinium?

Hoederer:
Sorry, W. The Regent has better things to do than remember the name of a random merc.

W:
Ha... did you say that to Ines too? Before she gave her life for your little dream?

Hoederer:
Still talking big, eh?

W:
What were you expecting? A big laugh and a standing ovation for your dumb shit? No tears on my face, Hoederer. That's not like me.

Hoederer:
Who's the dumb one? You're on the ground, not me.

W:
Like I said, I'm just... a little surprised.

Hoederer:
So surprised you missed multiple chances to maim me?

Hoederer:
Now that's not like you, W. What made you lose your cool?

W:
Let's see... how about an old friend coming back from the dead and trying to put his sword through me?

Hoederer:
I can believe that.

Hoederer:
W... who is this old friend you're talking about?

W:
That's what I don't like about you... You always think you can see right through me, same as her.

Hoederer:
Too bad for you, I'm right again.

Hoederer:
It's been a while since you snuck into Londinium. There aren't too many distractions like this in here. What did you see in the city?

W:
You're the one following Theresis, not me. Have you not kowtowed to his traitor throne enough times? Still can't see through his tricks?

Hoederer:
So you knew.

W:
Stop playing this game of you-know I-know. Look like a mercenary for once, Hoederer.

Hoederer:
I can't let you leave here alive, W.

Hoederer:
Of all the old friends that I've killed... you're probably the one who could best understand the choice I'm making.

W:
Now who's indecisive?

W:
I'm not taking my eyes off you. I want to see the Sarkaz who had the nerve to put his sword through me.

Hoederer:
Alright then.

Hoederer:
Goodbye, W.

Hoederer:
...Huh?

Hoederer:
Something deflected my sword... a dagger? Where did it come from?

???:
Don't move.

Hoederer:
......

Hoederer:
............

Hoederer:
It's been a long time, Ascalon.

W:
......

W:
Hey...

Ascalon:
Same to you. Don't move.

W:
*Cough* Or what?

W:
Wait, you came to save me, right?

Ascalon:
......

W:
Don't tell me you came to help him? Don't you know what Theresis did to her—

W:
......

W:
Maybe work on your aim? I just barely dodged that, what with my injuries and all.

Ascalon:
Too bad.

W:
......

Hoederer:
......

W:
You know you can't kill me now, right?

W:
You've been my boss, and I've been yours. But there's someone here who's been boss to both of us. And she's clearly not in a good mood.

Hoederer:
I know. Our heads could drop off our shoulders at any moment.

Hoederer:
I have nothing else to say.

Ascalon:
...W.

Ascalon:
Each word will make you bleed a little faster.

W:
I know, thanks for the concern.

W:
Looks like you'll have to accept a little failure if you don't want to die here together, 'Captain' Hoederer.
