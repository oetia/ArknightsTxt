Feist thought he was getting a talking to.

He was ready, thinking about what he could say to move the heart of the stubborn old worker before him.

Catherine has seen too much. Her temper is harder than the machines in the factory.

His cleverness with words has never been of any use before Catherine. Her fierce gaze sees through all, turning his wits to mush.

Feist feels a familiar sense of helplessness.

He always turns back into a little boy before his grandmother. Clumsy, excitable, prone to saying something he instantly regrets. He can only wait for his grandmother to speak first.

But Catherine says nothing.

She leads Feist down a long path. When they finally stop, he glances at her expression, and surprisingly sees no hint of anger.

Catherine:
......

Feist:
What's up ahead?

Catherine:
Nothing.

Feist:
I remember this workshop. You used to come here by yourself. Why is the production line empty, though?

Catherine:
What did you think this place was?

Feist:
The old workers wouldn't say, but Patto made a bet with Day that it's the secret workshop where they used to build steam armor.

Catherine:
Tell Patto he won the bet.

Feist:
So this is really the steam armor... no, I don't understand...

Feist:
I've followed you down this path a few times. I heard... I heard the machines running, and the conveyor belt moving.

Catherine:
They still run, if someone hits the switch.

Feist:
Why was it abandoned? Because the Steam Knights disappeared? No, even without orders, these machines are too dear to be left idle.

Catherine:
Why... why indeed?

The aging worker pats the machine, as though she was asking the cold metal.

Feist realizes that all the machines are spotless, with nary a speck of dust on them. It is as though time has stopped in this secret workshop.

Catherine:
Do you know why I'm the only one who came here?

Catherine:
Cam, Mike, Branson... they should have been standing there. And Harvey, he'd be responsible for watching the thrusters.

Catherine:
When the production line moves as one... I guarantee you've never heard a song quite like it.

Feist:
Harvey... isn't that Dad's name?

Catherine:
Yes.

Catherine:
Your dad was the smartest worker in the entire city. He came up with all sorts of crazy ideas.

Feist:
I've only seen him in photos.

Catherine:
I wish you could have seen him in the flesh. You're like him... too much so, at times.

Catherine:
Harvey was an expert in steam engines. He was like an engine himself, going so fast that I couldn't keep up.

Catherine:
I should've kept up.

Feist:
Didn't Dad go missing after getting caught in some business on the streets? That's what you said whenever I asked.

Catherine:
Some business... if what happened twenty-six years ago could be called as much.

Feist:
Twenty-six years ago? Didn't His Majesty...

Catherine:
Yes. Londinium fell into chaos overnight, the nobles were at each other's throats, and the dukes led the way.

Catherine:
Lots of factories got hit, especially military ones making steam armor. We were forced to stop work.

Catherine:
Harvey... he was young then. Almost the same age as you now. He loved the factory, and he loved this city.

Catherine:
He left the factory with the other workers to protest against the nobles. He wanted the dukes to hear the voices of the workers, and protect our livelihood.

Catherine:
Naive, wasn't he?

Feist:
......

Catherine:
I think back to it, on quiet nights... was it a cold one in December? Was his blood warm when it came out of his chest?

Feist:
Dad did it... for his ideals.

Catherine:
You want to say how noble it is to sacrifice for your ideals?

Catherine:
The leaders of your Self-Salvation Corps and that 'Doctor' of yours... is that what they say when they mourn their dead friends?

Feist:
It's what Commander Clovisia would say. As for the Doctor... the Doctor is even more quiet than usual at times like those. But I can feel the pure, heartfelt sincerity.

Catherine:
The dead are in no position to appreciate their greatness.

Catherine:
As for the ones they leave behind... these words of consolation are like cigarette smoke, light and fluffy, comforting for a moment, but when it leaves your lungs...

She takes a breath, a pause, then breathes out again.

The temperature is not low enough to leave a white fog.

Catherine:
Only one thing is for certain. Forty-one workers walked onto the largest street in Central Londinium on that night, twenty-six years ago. None came back.

Catherine:
Nothing changed about the city. The nobles, the wealthy, they pretend nothing happened, but this workshop would never be the same again.

Catherine:
I'm too old to train another group of workers as good as them, Feist.

Catherine:
They should've taken over for me. Harvey should've been the one to teach you all you knew.

Feist:
Granny...

Catherine:
Believe it or not, I've never blamed Harvey, and I've never blamed you.

Catherine:
But think about it carefully. You should've thought about it carefully when you tried to lead Patto and the others into your rebellion.

Catherine:
If you survive this war, but the others don't, will you be like me, fraught with grief and regret night after night, leaning over machines with no one to use them?

Feist:
......

Feist:
I didn't understand your decision three years ago, Granny.

Feist:
But now, when I think back to that day, when I try to put myself in your shoes...

Feist:
It would have taken me a long time to make that decision.

Feist:
You're right. Being smart isn't enough to fool death.

Feist:
But compromise and subservience won't get the job done either.

Catherine:
......

Catherine takes a drag on her cigarette and says nothing.

Feist:
I can't say I've thought this through.

Feist:
I can't guarantee we'll be able to drive out the Sarkaz.

Feist:
I've been feeling the weight on my shoulders, ever since Rhodes Island told us that we didn't have much time.

Feist:
I'm afraid I'll do something stupid again.

Feist:
But I can't stop here.

Feist:
Otherwise, I'll never be able to face Johnny, Gabby, and the Self-Salvation Corps fighters who gave their lives.

Catherine:
Too young... too naive, little brat.

Catherine:
You there, 'Doctor'. You look like you've got a grip on yourself, unlike this boy.

Catherine:
Would you kindly take care of him?

Catherine:
There's a hidden compartment in the third drawer of my desk.

Feist:
What?

Catherine:
The Sarkaz are watching closely. There's no place for you here. Read it and get out.

Catherine:
Don't bring trouble to anyone else.

Feist:
...Thanks, Granny.

You catch a glimpse of Catherine's expression as she passes by you.

Sorrow, and gratification.

Feist:
Let's take a look, Doctor.

Feist:
Granny's room is over here.

Allerdale:
Do you have the goods?

Londinium Citizen:
All here.

Allerdale:
How's Mr. Bader?

Londinium Citizen:
I heard he's ill. Anyway, it's all here. Our business is concluded.

Allerdale:
Good. Please pass on my gratitude.

One after another, heavily-armed mercenaries emerge from the warehouse.

Their leader walks towards the Self-Salvation Corps and extends the hand not holding a weapon.

???:
Are you our new employer? I'm Totter.

Allerdale:
Hello, Totter. Thank you for making the trip.

Totter:
The container was a little stuffy.

Totter:
Not that it's much different out here.

Allerdale:
Hah. Welcome to Londinium.

Clovisia:
Team 8, take our new friends to the base. Watch out for Sarkaz patrols.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Yes, ma'am. Come with us.

Allerdale:
The scales tip ever so slightly in our favor.

Allerdale:
We don't have much time left, Clovisia. They've began culling the nobles.

Clovisia:
We've evacuated the ducal residence and moved to Hideout Beta, which is better concealed. It's safe for now, but I'm not sure for how long.

Clovisia:
The number of Sarkaz in the city is increasing.

Allerdale:
The bulk of their forces will return in three days.

Clovisia:
The Nachzehrer King... The terrible corpse eater.

Clovisia:
Amiya told me about his powers. He 'eats' war... turning the battlefield into part of himself simply by standing on it.

Allerdale:
How do we defeat the battlefield itself?

Clovisia:
The dukes' fleets must be united to win.

Clovisia:
Our soldiers have to avoid him. That's why we need to move before he returns.

Clovisia:
They're living legends.

Allerdale:
The Sarkaz Royal Court... if they truly plan to suppress the entire city, over the heads of Lt. Colonel Lettou and the Defense Forces...

Allerdale:
You're good at math, Clovisia. What are the chances we triumph over these terrible legends?

Clovisia:
......

Allerdale:
Very good then. The Self-Salvation Corps didn't come this far by crunching numbers.

Clovisia:
The fighters are doing their best.

Clovisia:
Whatever may come, at least our hearts are one, aren't they, Allerdale?

Allerdale:
...Huh? Oh, yes, of course.

Clovisia:
What are you thinking about?

Allerdale:
I'm thinking... I hope tomorrow goes as well as these past few days have.

Siege:
Don't you think they've been going a little too smoothly lately?

Indra:
That's a good thing, innit?

Siege:
Good things don't happen on their own.

Morgan:
I agree with Vina. You get lucky once, sure, but not every time.

Siege:
......

Londinium Citizen:
—

Siege:
Hey, those men have been loitering for a while...

Londinium Citizen:
......

The man on the corner glances at them briefly.

He should not have been able to see so deep into the alley. But he suddenly pulls back his gaze, and briskly walks away with his head lowered.

Siege:
Dagda!

Dagda:
Yes?

Siege:
Tell Allerdale... tell the Corps to evacuate the warehouse district immediately!

Dagda:
Yes, Siege.

Dagda:
......

Dagda:
They want to know why.

Siege:
We are being watched... no time to explain.

Siege:
Dagda, Indra, Morgan. Proceed with the plan.

Sarkaz Warrior:
—

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Oh...

Siege:
Is everyone out?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
I... I don't know...

Siege:
Run now. Talk later.
