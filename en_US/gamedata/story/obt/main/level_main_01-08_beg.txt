Nearl:
Amiya, take the Doctor with you.

Nearl:
...Go, now!

Amiya:
No! I won't leave you...

Nearl:
Surely, you can feel it as well! She... If you don't leave, the entire rescue team will die here!

Nearl:
That Talulah...

Nearl:
She is a living monster! Amiya!

Amiya:
We'll be fine, as long as we stand together!

Nearl:
What about the Doctor, then? Can you ensure the Doctor's safety?

Amiya:
... Hm...

Nearl:
Team E4, we will stay behind and hold the line!

Nearl:
We must ensure that Amiya, Dr. {@nickname}, and the Medic teams escape safely!

Ace:
No, my squad will handle this.

Nearl:
Ace! Be rational, now's not the time to argue over this!

Ace:
I am rational.

Nearl:
Surely you can see it as well - everything around her is melting!

Amiya:
I'm not going to leave you all here to fight alone.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island... won't abandon you!

Dobermann:
Amiya, time is of the essence! You have to escape!

Ace:
...You should trust me.

Amiya:
I can't bear to see Rhodes Island sacrifice anyone!

Dobermann:
Think about our goal! Think about what we came here for!

Amiya:
This isn't the time to talk about that still!

Talulah:
...

Nearl:
--? The heat... is concentrating in her hands?

Guard:
Is she... distorting the space around her?

Nearl:
No, that's... the superheated air around her!

Amiya:
Watch out! She's getting ready to use her Arts...

Amiya:
No... You can't! Nearl!! Come back, now!!

Amiya:
That's not her... You'll be killed if you--

Talulah:
... Silence.

Nearl:
Uaaaaagh...!

Nearl:
Ugh... Gahh...

Dobermann:
Nearl!

Nearl:
*cough*... Stay back! Don't worry about me...

Nearl:
It's just... a little warm...

Dobermann:
What are you saying... don't worry?

Dobermann:
You don't have a single intact piece of armor on you, and you're telling me not to worry? !

Dobermann:
You mustn't fight her anymore!

Nearl:
I already said... Stay back!

Dobermann:
Nearl! You stubborn son of a...!

Talulah:
... Hm?

Ace:
Get down!

Nearl:
*cough* *cough*... What is it this time!

Ace:
... Invisible flames just swept over our head.

Ace:
Fall back. This entire block is melting...

Ace:
Don't sacrifice yourself in vain!

Nearl:
...

Nearl:
Just what monstrosity am I fighting against?

Ace:
We have to interrupt her casting somehow...

Ace:
Snipers, take aim at the enemy!

Talulah:
...

Talulah:
Resistance will usher hope into this land.

Talulah:
But resistance... will not change your fate.

Ace:
Fire!!

Talulah:
Chernobog has already attained liberation.

Talulah:
Our work here is done, and your group has proven to be quite interesting.

Dobermann:
What...

Talulah:
However, that is all you are worth.

Talulah:
You have chosen poorly.

Talulah:
Rhodes Island, you should have stood firmly with the Infected.

Medic:
What's... going on?

Medic:
Why is the entire plaza... getting scorched?

Medic:
What... happened... just now...?

Medic:
I... I can't breathe... it burns...

Guard:
Rocks, bolts, arrows...

Guard:
They're all gone.

Guard:
In a heartbeat... every object around her has been reduced to nothingness...

Talulah:
You have the resilience of liberators.

Guard:
... Not even ashes remain...

Nearl:
Amiya. You know what must be done.

Amiya:
...

Nearl:
Someone... has to stop her.

Talulah:
...But I grow tired of this.

Amiya:
...

Nearl:
Amiya!!

Talulah:
This is the price you must pay for slaughtering your fellow Infected.

Talulah:
I shall grant you an ending that I am quite fond of.

Talulah:
...Disappear.

Dobermann:
Damn it!!

Dobermann:
Run... hurry!!

Dobermann:
That amount of heat, at such a scale... No, no!

Dobermann:
Protect Amiya and the Doctor! Quick!!

Nearl:
We won't make it...!

Nearl:
I'll block her!!!

Medic:
AAAAAGH!!

Medic:
...

Medic:
...Huh???

Medic:
A-Amiya?

Amiya:
You will not hurt them.

Talulah:
...

Amiya:
I will never... allow you to do that!

Talulah:
-----Oh?

Amiya:
Ngh...

Amiya:
I must... protect everyone...!

Dobermann:
Amiya is holding back the enemy's Arts... all by herself...?

Nearl:
It's no good... That power is too tremendous!

Nearl:
Even Amiya won't be able to...

Nearl:
She won't be able to hold out for long!

Medic:
Amiya!

Amiya:
Don't worry... Don't worry about me...

Amiya:
I can handle this...!

Amiya:
I want to... I must... protect you all!

Medic:
Dark matter... is sealing the enemy's Arts within the plaza...

Amiya:
Ngh... Argh... Ughh!

Guard:
H-her barrier is catching on fire!

Dobermann:
Amiya, stop!! Your ring will--!

Amiya:
I don't care... even if...

Amiya:
Doctor, I'm sorry...

Amiya:
Even if this brings disaster, even if I...!

Amiya:
I don't want to lose... the person dearest to me... ever again...

Talulah:
Heh...

Talulah:
Very good.

Amiya:
Aghh... Aaaaaahhh...!!

Nearl:
Amiya!

Nearl:
Damn it... We're going to lose her...!

Dobermann:
What are you doing?

Nearl:
Destroying that she-dragon's Arts!

Dobermann:
You...

Nearl:
... 'O Light of Kazimierz, the Radiant Knight offers her body to thee...'

Dobermann:
Doctor! Just go! We'll help Amiya, but you have to...

Talulah:
--!

Amiya:
Aaaaaaaaghhh!!

Amiya:
What...?

Ace:
That's enough, Amiya.

Amiya:
--?!

Ace:
You've done well.

Ace:
Let us share your burden.

Amiya:
I...

Dobermann:
Amiya!

Ace:
Dobermann, take her with you. I'll see you soon.

Dobermann:
...Ace...

Amiya:
Ace... No... Ace...!

Amiya:
Promise me... that you'll...

Ace:
——

Ace:
I'm sorry, Dr. {@nickname}. You might not remember me.

Ace:
But I remember you, and I know what kind of person you are.

Ace:
... There will come a day when you and Amiya will face this cruel land together.

Ace:
That is why... you must cherish her, Doctor.

Ace:
Let's go.

Ace:
Godspeed.
