Hui-chieh:

From where I left off.

I ran for a very long time. Ran into a small village.

I didn't think too much about it at the time. I only wanted to find somewhere to hide. I didn't think I'd actually find somewhere to stay.

And I think that old couple thought of me as a daughter. Since their own sons and daughters had probably long since lost their lives to Ursus's countless wars.

They even kept my secret for me.

I'm sure I could've spent a lifetime repaying their kindness.

I regret that I never did.

January 13th

Infected Patrol Unit:
During our previous routine inspection, one of our people was assaulted.

Infected Patrol Unit:
Every household must now submit to a search, both for Infected and the attacker. Should we find them, we will execute them on the spot, and the household that harbored them will be punished accordingly.

Infected Patrol Unit:
If you don't want a hard labor sentence, turn them in. No one will come to harm if you do your civic duty, and the offenders and Infected will meet their proper end.

Infected Patrol Unit:
Now, we'll start from the first household.

Talulah:
It looks like the day came after all. There's no chance I'll make it through this one.

Old Woman:
Don't go out there, Talulah! Hide behind the shed... they won't look there! We'll tell them you were scared of what was coming and ran away! No one'd blame you for it!

Talulah:
But they might hurt you for it. I owe you better than that.

Talulah:
I've left you some gold coins... from Victoria. Spend them sparingly, and they'll have you warm and well fed for the rest of your lives.

Old Woman:
Talulah, Talulah! Where are you going? My Talulah... you can't, you can't go to them! Those black-hearted patrolling bugs eat people alive!

Talulah:
And I can't just stand by and let them torture the men and women of this village. I have to see this through. I'll lure them away, give them a wake-up call, let them know what they've wrought.

Talulah:
I know what's right. I'm not letting them punish these people. I'm not letting them murder anyone else.

Talulah:
I still remember how the boy next door was beaten to death for chucking a stone. I'll never forget.

Old Woman:
Talulah... Talulah! You can't... that's enough!

Old Woman:
Who?! Who's at the door...!? Is it the patrolmen?! Go away!

Alina:
Ma'am, it's me!

Old Woman:
Alina! Come in, come in!

Old Woman:
What's wrong? What's happened? Is there news?

Alina:
...Someone told.

Old Woman:
What? Told what?

Alina:
The Patrol Unit knows there's an Infected in our village.

Old Woman:
How could... this can't be... ahh!

Alina:
I don't know who it was, but we all know what happens to those who harbor Infected.

Talulah:
......

Alina:
Ma'am, my father passed early, and you took such good care of my mother, you and your husband both. You're like grandparents to me.

Alina:
And at this point, I can't really hide anything...

Talulah:
—Wait.

Talulah:
Miss, where did the Mister go?

Infected Patrol Unit:
Bloody old fart, what are you doing here?

Old Man:
I committed a crime!

Infected Patrol Unit:
A confession? Ah, yeah, I remember.  An old geezer got in our guy's way. Judging by your limp, you were one of the thugs who attacked him!

Old Man:
Yup!

Infected Patrol Unit:
...Not that you look worth the trouble. Go take a bloody hike. No point in dirtying our hands over a miserable little wretch.

Old Man:
Hold it. Sir, look at my skin here. What's that look like to you?

Infected Patrol Unit:
——

Infected Patrol Unit:
Infected! You're the Infected?

Talulah:
Are you serious?!

Old Woman:
I realized the moment I helped you change clothes... Talulah, we've known you were Infected for a long time now.

Talulah:
How—

Old Woman:
The old man worked the mines, and came back after he'd caught Oripathy himself! You've seen how he never takes off that jacket of his...

Old Woman:
He's going to go in your place, Talulah...!

Talulah:
No!

Talulah:
But how could he have been...

Old Woman:
You can't trust the people here like that! The villagers will say whatever they need to, for money or to save their own skins!

Old Woman:
For the last two years, Talulah, we've been truly happy to have you! You're a good girl... a good girl!

Old Woman:
We don't have long left to live, but Talulah, even if you're ill, you've still got years yet! You need to live, Talulah, that's what's right...

Old Woman:
Talulah, don't go! For heaven's sakes, don't go...!

Old Man:
Take me.

Old Man:
Take me then, officer!

Old Man:
Look at my skin! I'm the bloody diseased one!

Infected Patrol Unit:
......

Old Man:
If you don't believe me, then take a look at this!

Infected Patrol Unit:
A knife? Put that down. You can't touch us, old man.

Old Man:
No, officer, watch my Arts!

The elderly man slices open his own wrist, but no red flows onto the snow. It is instead as mist, scattering into the air.

Old Man:
Look, look... Officer! I'm an Infected, tried and true!

Infected Patrol Unit:
I believe you.

Infected Patrol Unit:
Thank you for your cooperation, Infected.

Old Man:
Nnf... nnf...!

Old Man:
Talulah...

Alina:
Talulah! Come back! Don't!

Alina:
Is that... fire?

Alina:
What?! Why is the house on—

Alina:
Talulah! Did you—

Alina:
Don't! Talulah! They'll destroy the whole village!
