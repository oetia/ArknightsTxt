Ch'en:
You have nowhere left to run.

Mephisto:
...Damn... you!

Blaze:
Where do you think you're going?

Faust:
Ngh...

Blaze:
Put your hands where I can see them!

Blaze:
I've seen through all your tricks, kid with the scales!

Blaze:
I told you, that's not going to work!

Amiya:
Blaze!

Blaze:
Hmph, don't worry. These attacks hurt about as much as firecrackers!

Faust:
You blocked my shots in advance.

Faust:
You know where they're coming from?

Blaze:
Of course I do, I've already figured you out.

Blaze:
Amiya, back off. I'm going to use 'that'!

Amiya:
Got it! I'll disrupt Mephisto's guards again, so make it quick!

Blaze:
Take this bit of my blood as a farewell gift, Reunion's 'Phantom Crossbowmen!'

Blaze:
Seethe, and blast apart their disguise!

Faust:
...!

Faust:
You're using your own blood as an incendiary?

Blaze:
Hah, do I look like some sort of caster to you? Only some egotistical newbie would go around committing arson like that.

Blaze:
Sorry, but this is just one of my fighting techniques. Show yourselves - you have nowhere to hide!

Phantom Crossbowman:
...

Phantom Crossbowman:
Faust, my camouflage is gone.

Faust:
Command, retreat.

L.G.D. Agent:
What are those...?! When did Reunion hide snipers over there?

Phantom Crossbowman:
Now?

Faust:
Right now.

L.G.D. Agent:
Multiple Reunion snipers have appeared, primarily in the 2nd floor of the east building and the 3rd floor of the south building!

Amiya:
Proceed with caution. They might have set up ambushes for us on the lower levels!

L.G.D. Agent:
Was the strange phenomenon in the building also caused by them?

Blaze:
Clever, you used refraction to make themselves seem invisible.

Blaze:
However, you can't completely conceal your tracks, or make sudden movements without compromising the effect of your Arts.

Blaze:
Am I correct?

Faust:
...You're quite smart.

Blaze:
It's all because of our great intel. Now that you know the gig's up, you should surrender.

Blaze:
If you want to continue fighting, I'll make you pay for the deaths of Ace and Scout. Hmph, I don't even care if you weren't involved, kid.

Phantom Crossbowman:
Faust, we still have ammunition.

Faust:
Retreat. We've already lost our intel advantage. I will keep them occupied. The rest of you, move immediately.

Phantom Crossbowman:
Understood.

Mephisto:
Why aren't you shooting her? Faust!

Mephisto:
Attack, my guards! Hurry! There are four of them, just four... and only three of them pose any threat!

Mephisto:
Fight! Tear apart those sinners now!

Amiya:
With Dr. {@nickname}'s leadership, the three of us are more than enough to defeat all of you!

Amiya:
Not to mention, those Infected who you harmed, who you robbed of their free will to the point of not even being people anymore...

Amiya:
Even that scaled boy next to you might not side with you anymore. His thoughts are filled with sorrow and turmoil...

Amiya:
Mephisto, you are alone on this battlefield!

Mephisto:
...

Faust:
You can read my mind?

Amiya:
No, I just felt it.

Faust:
So, you'd have no idea what I'm thinking.

Amiya:
...!

Blaze:
Amiya!

Amiya:
I'm fine, I can barely block his shots...! However, I won't be able to keep suppressing...

Mephisto's Guard:
GRAAAAAAGHHH!! AAAARRRRGGHH!!

Amiya:
My control is slipping!

Faust:
Mephisto, let's go.

Faust:
Their reinforcements are wiping out our forces.

Faust:
We've never even seen some of them before. There's been a change in the plan. Our moves have been read.

Mephisto:
...Why haven't our forces come? We have over twenty squads and two major brigades, so why are none of them here still?

Mephisto:
Where is Crownslayer? Or FrostNova?

Faust:
This isn't like Chernobog. We couldn't shut down the enemy's communications, so they were able to call lots of reinforcements and put up a vigorous resistance.

Faust:
Mephisto...

Mephisto:
Where are they still not here yet?!

Faust:
We won't know the reason unless we see it for ourselves. Let's get out of here first.

Amiya:
Blaze, I'm about to reach my limit. Can you finish this?

Blaze:
Sure thing. Just me and that Ch'en lady should suffice!

Faust:
Quick!

Ch'en:
Did I give you permission to leave?

Mephisto:
You... Guards! Kill her! Kill her!!

Mephisto's Guard:
Grrr... Grooooar!!!

Blaze:
Tsk... Over a dozen of them started moving at once. That's going to be a pain.

Mephisto's Guard:
GROOAAAAAR!!!

Blaze:
They're coming at us, Ch'en!

Ch'en:
Thank you, Rhodes Island operator. Now, nobody can get in my way.

Blaze:
Huh?

Ch'en:
(Haah... it's still no good? I don't have a way to completely counteract their cloaking... Forget it, this should be good enough.)

Ch'en:
(Chi Xiao, this time...)

Ch'en:
'Crimson overflowing—'

Mephisto's Guard:
...Gah!

Blaze:
...Can it be...?

Mephisto's Guard:
Uaaagh... Argh...

Mephisto's Guard:
Thank... you...

Mephisto:
...

Blaze:
Did you unsheath your sword just then? Just one slash? And you managed to cut down a dozen of those things?

Amiya:
That sword...

Blaze:
Amiya, I think I should start choosing my words a lot more carefully around her.

Ch'en:
Hmph.

Mephisto:
You... What did you do...

Faust:
Run!

Ch'en:
You can't escape either.

Faust:
Gah...!

Mephisto:
Faust... Faust! You're injured! You're... no, no... Nooo!

Faust:
...

Ch'en:
It's over.

Faust:
Not yet.

Ch'en:
What?!

Ch'en:
*cough* *cough*... He lured me in to shoot from point blank?

Blaze:
Didn't you manage to block it though?

Ch'en:
They used the cover of the explosion to make their escape!

Blaze:
Woah, a chain of explosions?

Blaze:
Argh, the entire top level is collapsing! We're not going to be able to chase after them?

Ch'en:
Half of that was your doing.

Blaze:
Can't do a thing about that.

Faust:
Hurry, we need to go.

Mephisto:
No, I need to stay here, until they come...

Faust:
We've failed this step. You must leave.

Mephisto:
I failed? I failed? Impossible!

Mephisto:
Wasn't everything going according to plan...? Did I not call for our reinforcements a long time ago?

Mephisto:
Were we betrayed? Was our information leaked? Who was it? Why does the L.G.D. know about our deployment and our strategies?

Faust:
Just go!

Mephisto:
If we weren't betrayed, then who could have done it?!

Mephisto:
Talulah would never make a mistake... So she must have planned for this...

Mephisto:
No, that's impossible... Why would she set us up like this?

Mephisto:
...Faust, there's no way I can accept this... I refuse to believe it.

Faust:
Jump! I'll hold on to you!

Mephisto:
Fine...

Blaze:
Well... shoot, Madam. Looks like this building's going to need some serious renovating.

Blaze:
It's a shame that those two kids got away though.

Blaze:
Those mindless followers are still coming at us like cornered animals. Dealing with all of them is still going to be a serious thorn in the side.

Amiya:
At least we managed to take back the headquarters.

Amiya:
This is our victory, even if it's a short-lived one.

Ch'en:
Amiya...

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
How did Rhodes Island manage to make it out of Chernobog?

Amiya:
Miss Blaze came to our aid in the knick of time.

Amiya:
There was also a loud-mouthed L.G.D. officer just outside the ruined city...

Blaze:
It would've been easier if you had just helped us in the first place instead of watching from the sidelines.

Blaze:
I was expecting you to say something like 'I didn't need Rhodes Island's help anyway,' or 'I'd rather die than work with them.'

Blaze:
But at least you don't seem to be that stubborn. Is there anything else you'd like to say? If not, I'd like to head back to Rhodes Island.

Ch'en:
I never knew Rhodes Island had an aircraft like that.

Blaze:
Heh, we have a lot of things that might surprise you.

Ch'en:
Just like you, we don't want to play our entire hand.

Blaze:
You're not counting us as one of your cards, are you?

Ch'en:
...

L.G.D. Agent:
Um, Madam Ch'en... there's an incoming transmission on a private line.

L.G.D. Agent:
It's for you.

Ch'en:
Hello?

Wei Yenwu:
Well done, Madam Ch'en.

Wei Yenwu:
Is Madam Swire also on this channel?

Swire:
I am.

Wei Yenwu:
Please report your progress.

Swire:
I bailed Rhodes Island out, and also finished arrangements for the various brigades. Coordinating and managing everything took me three full nights.

Swire:
How about you, Madam Ch'en?

Ch'en:
I've already taken back—

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
—with Rhodes Island's assistance, we've taken back the L.G.D. Headquarters. Their commander will spread word of their defeat through the ranks.

Ch'en:
The Reunion forces left in Lungmen have been coralled into our ambush points using the routes we arranged for them.

Ch'en:
Next, we just need to wait for their counterattack.

Ch'en:
My mission is now complete.

Wei Yenwu:
I've also received reports from a few of your other colleagues. All missions in the last phase have been completed flawlessly. Well done, all of you.

Wei Yenwu:
We will now move onto the next phase.
