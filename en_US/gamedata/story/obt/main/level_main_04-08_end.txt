Meteorite:
...!

Frostleaf:
I know it's you behind there. Hold your fire.

Frostleaf:
Look who I brought.

Amiya:
Meteorite, it's us!

Meteorite:
Who? Is that.. Amiya?!

Meteorite:
Amiya! Amiya, you really came!

Meteorite:
It's so good to see you...

Meteorite:
...

Meteorite:
...but you shouldn't have come. This whole thing is one big trap.

Meteorite:
It wasn't worth it for you to come to our rescue.

Meteorite:
This was the wrong decision...!

Frostleaf:
There's no point in blaming her now.

Frostleaf:
Besides, even if everyone else doesn't think you can be rescued, Amiya would still not give up on you.

Meteorite:
I wasn't blaming her! It's just that...

Meteorite:
Tsk. Sorry, Amiya.

Amiya:
It's okay. I'm just glad to see that you're all still safe.

Meteorite:
Amiya...

Amiya:
But... what happened to Jessica?

Jessica:
Ugh...

Meteorite:
She's... still in shock.

Meteorite:
Originally, I wanted to wait for her to get better, but...

Meteorite:
It seems like she's been... traumatized.

Jessica:
...

Amiya:
Jessica, are you okay?

Jessica:
...

Amiya:
This is all I can do...

Amiya:
Frostleaf, do me a favor. Place her hands on my arm, and hold her fingers tight.

Frostleaf:
...Sure thing.

Amiya:
Good.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...!!

Amiya:
Ngh...

Frostleaf:
Amiya!

Amiya:
I'm fine! It's just... Nnh...

Amiya:
Such deep sorrow...

Amiya:
It's a bit vague, but...

Jessica:
...

???:
Jessica!!

???:
It's fine now...

???:
You have to be strong, Jessica...!

Jessica:
...?

Jessica:
...Amiya...?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
I'm here.

Jessica:
Amiya... Amiya...

Amiya:
There, there... Everything will be okay.

Meteorite:
Jessica... Are you alright...?

Jessica:
Amiya... What was I...

Jessica:
...I'm so sorry... I didn't think... I didn't think that...

Amiya:
It's fine now...

Jessica:
Those, those... Auugh...

Amiya:
I know what it's like.

Amiya:
Yes, I've also experienced it...

Amiya:
...Wanting to run, but your legs not moving...

Amiya:
...Wanting to scream, but your voice not coming out...

Amiya:
I understand what you've been through, Jessica... I've been there too.

Jessica:
...

Amiya:
Try standing up.

Amiya:
You don't need to be afraid anymore...

Amiya:
Because we're all together now. You're not alone. We'll always be there for you.

Amiya:
Let's go back to Rhodes Island together.

Amiya:
Franka and Liskarm are waiting for you.

Jessica:
...

Jessica:
...Mhm!

Frostleaf:
...

Frostleaf:
Amiya... You... what did you do just now...

Amiya:
Shh... Keep it a secret from Dr. Kal'tsit.
