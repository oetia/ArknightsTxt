Oh... Rosmontis, what are you doing?

Rosmontis:
I... I wanna fix this terminal.

Rosmontis:
Six years of memories up to last year... I saved them all in here...

Rosmontis:
This morning, I went to read the log from June 12, but the screen wouldn't turn on.

Rosmontis:
What if... what if I can't ever read them again...?

Rosmontis:
The March 14th log, when I went to the botanical gardens with daddy, or hiking in July, or the time when mommy...

Rosmontis:
...Mommy...

D- don't cry! Listen, you're not great with screens, right?

Why not wait until Scout can help you fix it? Or Closure?

I'll take it to Closure for you. She'll fix it up lickety-split!

Rosmontis:
Scout...

Rosmontis:
Is Scout that one operator who moves around all quiet?

That's him! You know him?

Rosmontis:
Yeah.

Rosmontis:
With that perfectly polished look... like a porcelain doll.

Rosmontis:
There he is.

Huh...?

Scout:
I had yet to hear your estimation of me. I now understand how weak it is.

When did you get here?!

Scout:
You could say I have always been here. I am used to concealing myself.

Rosmontis:
So Mr. Scout was here all along.

Rosmontis:
Why didn't Blaze sense it?

I... I wasn't paying attention. I just didn't notice!

Hey, if you were standing here all this time, why didn't you help her fix it?

Scout:
Forgive me. We are mere moments from undertaking a mission. I must focus my energy on calibrating my weaponry.

Scout:
You might ask Closure, or the good Mechanist to assist you.

Are you about to go save Dr. {@nickname}?

Ace:
Yes.

Oh. You're going too.

Ace:
It's me we're talking about. If I didn't go, what kind of joke would Rhodes Island's elite operators be?

Scout:
And what did Ascalon say?

Ace:
The usual. She's not going. Always there with Kal'tsit, that one.

Scout:
Did it ever occur to you... That now is perhaps not the optimal time?

Ace:
But it might be our last chance.

Ace:
Chernobog is probably going to turn back deep into Ursus to avoid that Catastrophe. And a rescue operation in the Ursus interior is going to be damn near impossible.

I keep hearing you talk about it, but is this Dr. {@nickname} really worth all this?

Ace:
Worth as much as Amiya and Kal'tsit.

Rosmontis:
Have I met the Doctor?

Ace:
Not yet. But you will soon.

Rosmontis:
Good. I want to know what the Doctor is like too.

Rosmontis:
I really, really want to.

Scout:
You will, kitten.

By the way, Ace, there's an uninfected girl named GreyThroat on your team.

Ace:
I'm aware. She's been training in isolation.

Ace:
Listen, Blaze. I've been working with her for a few months now. She has trouble expressing herself, but she's not a bad person.

She looked my teammate in the eye and asked, 'How hard could it be to be Infected?'

Ace:
I know. But it might have been a legitimate question to her. She might really be curious.

Ace:
It's not my place to demand an operator turn her opinion on a dime. And GreyThroat has never once questioned orders.

I don't care. I'm not going to stand by and let her insult my teammates, and I sure as hell won't let her disgrace the struggle of the Infected.

Ace:
Now's not the time. I can see the rage you're holding back. But really, not now.

She said it right in front of me!

Scout:
Take a breath, Big Cat.

Scout:
You have a task at hand yourself.

...I do.

Fine. We'll deal with it when you get back.

Since when is Ace more senior than me?

Ace:
When you take that tone, I start to think maybe you're screwing around.

Scout:
She may very well be mocking you.

When he goes two days without shaving, he'll definitely look way more senior.

Rosmontis:
Ace's beard is very manly.

Ace:
...Hm.

Hahaha! I have to go move some stuff around. Got my own job to do, you know. Later.

Let's get a drink when I'm done!

Scout:
Try not to puke this time.

Scout:
Misery spent two hours scrubbing the floor. I wager he would vomit himself when faced with that task again.

Who knew you could hold your liquor so well!

Rosmontis, Mechanist will give you back your terminal in a bit.

Be a good girl and wait patiently. But don't forget either!

Rosmontis:
I'll definitely remember! Bye bye!

Scout:
Don't burn yourself!

Relax. I can control my own Arts.

Blaze:
...How is it you went before me?

Blaze:
Ace, was some uninfected girl like GreyThroat really worth training?

Blaze:
How much trust did we earn? And how much trust did we give?

Blaze:
If the Doctor...

Blaze:
I'm saying bad things about you. To your face.

Blaze:
If there's a Doctor hanging around here, hurry up and come out already. You'll need some fancy Arts to hide behind that wall if you don't want me to find you.

Blaze:
Then I'll string you up on a lamppost as bait for Reunion. Don't worry! You won't die. A few bolts and a knife or two never hurt anyone.

Blaze:
....sigh.

Blaze:
Sigh!

Blaze:
Did Amiya send you?

Blaze:
Whatever. That's what she's best at. And what she's worst at...

Blaze:
I keep trying to remind her, to get her thinking about how she's still just a kid... it always seems to have the opposite effect.

Blaze:
I guess she'll never be able to put down that grown up persona of hers as long as she's the leader of Rhodes Island.

Blaze:
Of course, if it wasn't Amiya who sent you, if you decided to come keep me company all by yourself, I'm not against the idea.

Blaze:
...Hold me back? Haha! I could carry three of you on my back and I wouldn't even notice. One little Dr. {@nickname} can't hold me back.

Blaze:
Hey, look over there.

Reunion Member:
Go on! Get out of here! We don't want to fight!

L. G. D. Officer:
Hmph... we won't yield to the Infected!

Reunion Member:
You're outnumbered! What's the point?

L. G. D. Officer:
Duty!

Reunion Member:
Don't blame us for what happens! You see those monsters behind us? Just run already!

L. G. D. Officer:
What monsters?!

Blaze:
See that Reunion group cutting through the alleys? They're picking at Lungmen's vanguard units. They won't hold for long...

Blaze:
Give me a path.

Blaze:
The fastest, of course!

Blaze:
Don't give me that look. It's not like I've never carried you before.

Blaze:
Here we go! Smash Reunion and save the Lungmenites!
