Siege:
We're here. This path... connects the palace and the ducal manor.

Siege:
(Whispers) ...Golden mane.

Totter:
What did you just say, Vina?

Siege:
No, it's nothing. It's been a long time since I saw them.

Allerdale:
Not long ago, we left this place. Today, we walk these ancient bricks again. This path has likely never been trodden this frequently.

Allerdale:
It was only meant for emergencies.

Totter:
Too bad. Be it the ducal manor or the palace, it has never really served anyone in their time of need.

Dagda:
Mercenary, if you don't want to buy everyone here a drink, you'd better not joke about that.

Totter:
Right then.

Siege:
Allerdale, you said I once came back through this passage with the Sighs of Kings...

Siege:
I really don't remember that.

Siege:
This has me very restless. It's as though I am purposefully avoiding a great responsibility.

Allerdale:
Vina, it's okay. You were too young then.

Allerdale:
Anyone who tried to force any kind of responsibility onto a child that had only just learnt to speak would have to be extraordinarily selfish. No mistake about it.

Allerdale:
Apologies. I might have insulted someone close to you.

Siege:
Hm, actually, I rather agree with what you said.

Siege:
But now, we've come back nonetheless.

Siege:
'Responsibility'? 'Miracles'? I have no idea what they expected of me, nor do I really care.

Siege:
But I stand here today, and I have something I must accomplish.

Siege:
I shan't take on any titles because of it. I'm doing this... so that the people will know peace again.

Allerdale:
Hah... We are approaching our objective, then.

Allerdale:
Sirs, please tear down the brick wall blocking the path up ahead. Be quiet. Don't let them find us.

Allerdale:
We need to go down from here...

Siege:
Right, I...

Allerdale:
What's the matter, Vina?

Siege:
......

Siege:
Never mind. Let's keep going.

Totter:
No one on our tail.

Victorian Mercenary:
The Sarkaz couldn't have figured we would go down.

Victorian Mercenary:
They must be throwing quite the party above us.

Siege:
It's possible that our allies are sacrificing their lives in this intense battle.

Siege:
I was actually apprehensive when Allerdale proposed this plan.

Siege:
I should be standing with the Corps fighters... and the Rhodes Islanders.

Allerdale:
The Doctor's plan is meant to ensure our operation remains undetected.

Allerdale:
No matter what happens aboveground, we must get our hands on the Sighs of Kings.

Allerdale:
It is the key to foiling the Sarkaz's plans and can even turn the tide of the war.

Morgan:
This sword... I've only heard of it in the stories.

Allerdale:
It was the sword of the Aslan forefathers.

Allerdale:
As the legend goes, it was forged for the Aslans by the fairy of the grasslands. A pasha of yore once beheaded the Poltergeist King with it.

Allerdale:
Then, the Aslans came to Victoria to rule, and it became the symbol of their reign.

Allerdale:
According to some historical records, in the days before the nomadic cities came to be, the kings once cleaved Catastrophes with it.

Allerdale:
For centuries, there was not a single storm to threaten Londinium.

Allerdale:
The masses believed that as long as the Sighs of Kings remains, Londinium would overcome all her foes forever, be they powerful poltergeists or terrifying Catastrophes.

Siege:
......

Morgan:
You can't really believe...

Dagda:
I do.

Indra:
I... I believe in Vina.

Morgan:
It's like you're trying to change the subject. Of course I believe in Vina too, but you can tell right away it's just a fairy tale. That's not real...

Allerdale:
That is in fact not a fabrication to legitimize the Aslans' reign. It really can cleave Catastrophes.

Allerdale:
If The Shard, with its ability to pull in storms, is Victoria's spear against the outside world, then the Sighs of Kings, capable of rending Catastrophes asunder, is its strongest shield.

Allerdale:
The spear is known far and wide, yet the shield exists almost only in legend.

Allerdale:
But if we are able to wield this power, we will almost certainly be able to stop the Sarkaz's ambitions.

Siege:
Allerdale, you're very familiar with our Realmblade.

Allerdale:
I... I'm only fulfilling my responsibilities as a member of House Cumberland.

Siege:
Have you seen the blade with your own eyes?

Allerdale:
......

Allerdale:
Yes, but only once.

Allerdale:
What I saw... was something that could only happen in a dream.

Dagda:
What did the blade look like?

Allerdale:
It... It was beautiful.

Allerdale:
It has the power to liven one's heart. The moment you lay your eyes upon it, you'll believe from the pit of your soul that you can triumph over anything.

Morgan:
A bit over the top, innit?

Indra:
Legends... Legends...

Indra:
Maybe that's about the Sarkaz? Is that sword especially good at cutting Sarkaz?

Morgan:
Is cutting all you think about?

Morgan:
If Vina had beaten that Sanguinarch bloody with her hammer the other day, it'd have a story like that in two hundred years.

Allerdale:
Haha, that just might happen.

Allerdale:
Then Rhodes Island will become the fairy that bestowed the hammer.

Dagda:
Closure'll probably be happy about that.

Morgan:
'The Ark of God in the barrenlands! The return of the king!'

Indra:
How's that a story? It's all real!

Indra:
In twenty years, the story of the 'Great King Vina, leading the Londiniers to chase out the King of Sarkaz' is bound to become a favorite story of all the kids that run around in front of our houses!

Morgan:
Then I've got to spend some time thinking how to better tell Vina's story... Hm...

Siege:
This isn't my story.

Siege:
The bold, fearless Hannah 'Indra' Jackson, the witty Kate Morrigan, and the loyal, tenacious Isabelle Montague.

Siege:
Also... the noble, upright Allerdale Cumberland.

Siege:
This is your story.

Allerdale:
Hah.

Siege:
Let's keep going.

Siege:
The story isn't going to write itself.

Kyngasycath, the Sighs of Kings.

In her heart, Siege thinks to herself that she must have seen it before.

They are only vague fragments of memories and unclear voices.

Impassioned Voice:
My daughter, come. Take this sword.

Impassioned Voice:
Is it calling to you?

Impassioned Voice:
Feel it.

Impassioned Voice:
Feel this voice...

Impassioned Voice:
Feel Victoria.

The palace is burning.

She wants to climb up and see what kind of show they are putting on outside. Things are always very lively on the king's birthday.

But all she sees is fire. The fire rages. There are also many men in uniform, either fleeing in all directions away from the flames or lying lifelessly on the ground.

The earth trembles. She's suddenly worried about the glass fowlbeast by her bed. It's a gift that she has just received. Lately, she hasn't been able to sleep without hugging that delicate little trinket.

Victorian Officer:
Her Royal Highness Alexandrina!

Victorian Officer:
Don't go back! It's dangerous! Thank goodness you ran outside! You're their only objective, aside from His Majesty...

Victorian Officer:
His Majesty... His Majesty has...

Victorian Officer:
No, you needn't know this.

Victorian Officer:
He left us with one final order. To get you away.

Allerdale:
Vina, what's wrong? You've been rather out of it since we came underground.

Siege:
I... I remembered something. Something that I thought I'd forgotten long ago.

Allerdale:
The kind that hurts to remember, or the kind that brings you joy?

Siege:
It's just... a voice.

Victorian Officer:
Your Highness... you must walk the rest of the way on your own.

Victorian Officer:
You were here not too long ago. You remember, don't you?

Victorian Officer:
They're coming for us.

Victorian Officer:
No matter what happens, you must keep running down this passage.

Victorian Officer:
Do not turn back.

The phantoms have disappeared, and the memories recede like the tide.

She finds herself standing in the middle of a long path.

At the end of the path is a door. The door divides life and death, and whether it leads from life to death or from death to life, it opens only to the King of Victoria.

Siege:
We're here.
