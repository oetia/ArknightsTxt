Shieldguard:
All these corpses... have started to rot.

Shieldguard:
They're W's men. A bunch of mercenary devils.

Shieldguard:
This makes no sense. We haven't done anything to these guys. They were lynched, and clearly they were killed off in secret.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
When did all this internal cleanup begin anyway?

Shieldguard:
No idea. My guess is it happened within the last few days.

Shieldguard:
One thing is clear, though. Talulah's been planning this for a long time. Damn it. I can't believe we didn't even see through her facade until it was too late. She really strung us along, that monster!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Regardless of whether they willingly obeyed her or not, it was Talulah who ordered the Sarkaz mercenaries to fight us. So is there a point to killing them off? What is she even trying to accomplish? Setting an example?

Rhodes Island Guard?:
No, I doubt it... No one can threaten even a lone Sarkaz, let alone a whole group of them.

Shieldguard:
Yeah, that's right. They do say that the devils will kill whoever that dares threaten them, and if you ask me, the ones we have in the guerrillas are living proof of that.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
That makes no sense, then. If these guys were killed because they stuck with W, then whose side is W on?

???:
Well, maybe you'd like to take a little guess? I just might give you a little something if you get it right.

Shieldguard:
Stop where you are! Put your hands up!

Rosmontis:
—!

???:
Now, now. Let's not be hasty. Keep your weapons to yourselves. Wow. That's a big sword. New blood from Rhodes Island, I presume?

Rhodes Island Guard?:
...W...!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
It was you... You are the one who killed Scout!

Rosmontis:
Is that her?

Rosmontis:
Then I'll avenge Mr. Scout!

W:
What are you talking about?

W:
Hold on, time out. White kitty, you can kill me all you want, and I'll admit to anything I've done, but I'm not gonna take the fall for something I didn't do.

W:
And I gotta remind the Rhodes Island boy in Reunion cosplay over there...

W:
Yeah, I can tell it's you. I remember you. Let me make this clear: I let you get away. Think about it, what good would it even do for me, turning you in to the old man?

W:
Scout died for Rhodes Island. I took his life only because I didn't have a choice.

W:
Listen up. He could easily have gotten out of that without so much as a scratch. He just decided to put on a show with me for the Reunion folks to keep you and the others alive.

W:
You think I wanted to kill him? Forget the fact he's a Sarkaz, you really think I would kill one of the last Sarkaz stealth masters left, one of the best elite marksmen out there, and, above all, the guy who could've been the next Kazdel hero?

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Liar!

W:
What are you going off on me for?!

W:
You little shit, how dare you go off on me?!

W:
You know what, now I'll really go off on you. If you were actually as good as you say, you could've killed the dragon lady right there, and we'd be dealing with a lot less dead people!

W:
Why else would I even kill Scout, someone I really respected?!

W:
You think I'm some kind of a sellsword, don't you? Sure, I'll tell you. Yes. Yes, I am. It's true, but unlike you guys, I rank people by their worth.

W:
Scout was... And listen up! To me, he was worth more than anyone else, even back in Babel.

W:
I'd even say he's worth more than me.

W:
...So let me ask you again: what is it about you that's actually worthy of his sacrifice? Huh?!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
You...

W:
Ugh, ahem, pfft...

Rosmontis:
Put your hands up, and put your weapon down. I don't believe you.

W:
......

W:
Look, I count myself plenty lucky that I wasn't burned to a crisp by Talulah or pinned against a wall and crushed to death by that monster Kal'tsit carries around.

W:
So, I seriously mean it, can't you just leave me alone? Having the bigger gun doesn't make what you say more righteous. Otherwise, I'd be the just about most righteous person here, what with how many people I've blown up.

W:
While we're at it, Kal'tsit said so herself. We're on the same side right now.

W:
I'm on your side.

W:
I even have a recording right here. Wanna take a listen?

Rosmontis:
......

Rosmontis:
Why are you in such a rush?

W:
Huh? What, kid, do you read minds or something? Then how come you still don't believe me?

W:
Of course I'm in a rush! If I don't kill Talulah soon, everyone I care about is gonna die!

W:
The Sarkaz mercenaries have a fatal flaw. They don't ever give the situation any thought unless they're out to kill someone.

W:
Tell them to do something, and they'll do it, no questions asked. They don't care about themselves, and they don't care about other people's lives at all, let alone their own.

W:
My point is, if I don't go fetch them soon, they'll all be dead.

Shieldguard:
You can convince them?

W:
Let's save that till Talulah's dead.

W:
Alright, you've wasted enough of my time already. Move aside, will you?

Rhodes Island Guard?:
......

W:
You, let me say just one thing.

W:
Make his death mean something.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
——

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Do I really have that right?

Rosmontis:
You do.

W:
Yeah, you do. You're still around because of everything my old pals did.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
...Ah...!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Fine, enough! Rosmontis, let her go!

Rosmontis:
You mean she's telling the truth? She protected Amiya and everyone else?

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Trust me, and trust her this once. Just this once.

Rosmontis:
Okay.

W:
So I'm good to go?

Rhodes Island Guard?:
...Scram!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Don't ever let me see you again.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
—Don't ever let me see you again!

W:
Well, thanks, and don't worry. If I screw this up, you sure as hell won't ever see me again.

W:
So, looks like they're fine with it. What do you say, guerrillas?

Shieldguard:
......

Shieldguard:
The Captain told us you can't be trusted.

W:
I think the old boy's right. I've told way too many lies. Truths, too. It's definitely not easy to pick anything meaningful out of my words.

W:
I can't do anything about the way you guys see me, right?

W:
But no one wants to blow her up more than I do, I can promise you that.

W:
I'll also say this: you should stop staring at other people's backs so much. You don't get it. You have no idea just what went down with the devils.

W:
You have no idea what my mercenaries died for. So, don't you dare look at me like that.

W:
Ha. Did you people give the dragon lady that look too?

Shieldguard:
——

Shieldguard:
Going by your wounds, I can see you've already fought Talulah.

W:
Haha. Well, look at the eyes on this guy! Only took you about ten minutes.

W:
That's right. I fought her. And I lost.

Shieldguard:
You're pretty heavily injured, you had your ass handed to you. What are you even hoping to accomplish?

W:
I'm alive. That's good enough. If the Rhodes Island bunny can't deal with her, then I'll give it another go and blow Talulah up again.

Shieldguard:
You don't stand a chance against her.

Shieldguard:
If you want to die, suit yourself. We won't get in the way.

W:
Buddy, I know how to take detours. You know I do.

W:
I certainly didn't expect to see you guys running around with Rhodes Island, but I actually went out of my way to come meet you here. I'm here to save your lives.

W:
Have you seen the bodies of my poor brothers strewn all around the ground here? Take a good look.

W:
My brothers, there's more than just civilians and Reunion folks left in the city.

W:
The Ursus soldiers are wearing our clothes.

Shieldguard:
We've come across them already, and we are more than rea—

W:
More than ready? Seriously?

Shieldguard:
Go climb a tree.

W:
I'm just trying to tell you the truth, and you know I don't do that often. You better not be ready to die.

W:
If Talulah's doing all this, she clearly doesn't give a damn about Reunion at all. She wants Reunion to die right here.

W:
Anyway, this is where we say our goodbyes. If luck's on our side, maybe all of us will still be alive when this is over.

W:
And if you don't believe me, then believe in your own luck, by all means.

W:
So let's all hope it's good.

Kal'tsit:
We're almost to the sarcophagus core.

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
I'm worried I won't be able to protect you.

Kal'tsit:
Actually, Dr. {@nickname}, there will come a day I won't be able to protect you.

Kal'tsit:
First, there's simply far more factions than anticipated fighting against each other. Their penchant for violence is no less destructive than the Catastrophes, and not only will that present unexpected problems, it will also bring with it deaths that we simply could not have anticipated.

Kal'tsit:
Even if we knew everything, it doesn't necessarily mean we would be able to change everything. It's precisely this that gave rise to so many tragedies, and it's also the beginning of many journeys.

Kal'tsit:
Secondly, Dr. {@nickname}...

Kal'tsit:
Are you really worthy of my protection?

Kal'tsit:
I'm just putting on some pressure with information asymmetry.

Kal'tsit:
Of course, Cautuses will bite if it comes down to it.

Kal'tsit:
But if I just handed you the answer, it'd only make you be even more suspicious of the truth. You have to either fight for the truth yourself or wait for the answer to reveal itself.

Kal'tsit:
You won't answer me.

Kal'tsit:
I can tell... After all, this is the person you used to be.

Kal'tsit:
But you aren't the same. Dr. {@nickname}, promise me you aren't the person you once were.

Kal'tsit:
Well.

Kal'tsit:
Have I ever placed a curse on you, Dr. {@nickname}? You broke the curse, and now you're using it on me?

Kal'tsit:
Whether you are worthy or not is not for me to decide.

Kal'tsit:
Even if you aren't worthy, I will still do it. As for why, I suppose I will just have to tell you later on.

Kal'tsit:
—The Herd!

Sarkaz Herd:
Where you two going?

Sarkaz Herd:
Home? H-Ho-Home?

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
One thing is clear. All the Sarkaz mercenaries in the core have turned.

Kal'tsit:
All operators, switch your self-cleansing devices on.

Kal'tsit:
Protect yourselves before you try to protect anyone else.

Kal'tsit:
Amiya... Are you really going to carry the burden of this unfortunate race's fate?
