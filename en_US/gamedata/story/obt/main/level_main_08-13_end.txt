Talulah:
Ugh... Get the... hell away!

'Emperors' Blade':
Such potential!

'Emperors' Blade':
*Hiss*...! I should take my hat off to you!

'Emperors' Blade':
Alas, I forgot to bring my cap with me today.

Talulah:
Haah... haah...

'Emperors' Blade':
It's pointless to keep fighting.

'Emperors' Blade':
We are merely protectors of Ursus. You may take you men with you. Live on as the protector of these Infected if that is your wish. Let us take what we must to realize our respective goals. I find that reasonable.

Talulah:
You call yourself a protector... but who did you ever protect...?!

'Emperors' Blade':
All nations have men who call themselves protectors. There are many things that need to be protected, and also far too many men who call themselves protectors.

'Emperors' Blade':
Most of them are corrupt and incompetent, yet the rest of us excel precisely because of the things we protect.

'Emperors' Blade':
We are protecting Ursus's future.

Talulah:
You think that will cover up everything you've done?!

Talulah:
You've committed more crimes than anyone can ever count. You drove Simonch City into the lakes, and not a single person got out of that Elafia village—

Talulah:
I can name all the atrocities you've committed one by one and let the whole world know all that you've done!!

Talulah:
And you dare to brag to me about your country's will...? Your foolishness will one day be crushed by reality!

'Emperors' Blade':
......

'Emperors' Blade':
All societies will at some point have to bring out their lashes and whip their laziest and most simpleminded members. That being said, we are blades, not whips.

'Emperors' Blade':
If cutting off branches that do nothing but suck the tree dry of nutrients was a crime, then yes, that makes us evil.

'Emperors' Blade':
You said you will 'expose' our 'atrocities.' That merely tells me you are unable to confront us, not to mention how likely the way you see things will change.

'Emperors' Blade':
If I walk towards you, I suppose you will take a step back?

Shieldguard:
Talulah...!

Talulah:
Stay back! Protect the soldiers!

'Emperors' Blade':
Ursus's beneficence is of equal weight to its devilries. When you stand up against our evil deeds, you must also face all the good that we have done.

'Emperors' Blade':
All of it.

'Emperors' Blade':
A nation cannot be measured by good or evil. Nothing is worthy of discussion on this metric.

'Emperors' Blade':
...Perhaps it's not realistic to expect you to reach his heights and fully grasp his wisdom so soon.

'Emperors' Blade':
But if everything is as he said, then perhaps we will come for your advice when that day comes.

'Emperors' Blade':
Right now, aside the potential and the seeds hidden in you, you have nothing.

'Emperors' Blade':
The empire isn't something you can understand, Vouivre.

'Emperors' Blade':
Wait. Vouivre... No...

'Emperors' Blade':
You... It can't be...

'Emperors' Blade':
36... 【Code word】!

'Emperors' Blade':
—Wendigo—

???:
Two Royal Guards by their lonesome aren't enough to kill me. If you want to make an enemy of me, you'd better bring a third man with you next time.

Shieldguard:
Captain!

Shieldguard:
Shields forward! Push!

'Emperors' Blade':
No. Patriot. No.

Patriot:
There are five Royal Guards here, counting the ones still trying to put up a fight with my daughter over on the other side.

Patriot:
The Royal Guards I knew would never waver or pussyfoot around! Tell me! How confident are you in your strength?!

'Emperors' Blade':
We don't want to be your enemy!

'Emperors' Blade':
Wendigo... You are a legend known to a few of us in the Empire's army.

'Emperors' Blade':
Even if the common folk of the nomadic cities have long forgotten, all of us still remember the tales our forebears told us.

'Emperors' Blade':
You have my respect, Wendigo!

Patriot:
......

Shieldguard:
Ah...

'Emperors' Blade':
...So you follow her. Lying has become second nature to the soldiers of the tundras, it's hard to know what to believe.

'Emperors' Blade':
......

'Emperors' Blade':
So it's the truth, then. You are Infected.

Patriot:
It shouldn't come as a surprise that I am fighting for the Infected.

'Emperors' Blade':
That's not right, Wendigo. This plan will fail.

Patriot:
There are lots of Infected in the country.

'Emperors' Blade':
Fantasies do not come true just because more people believe in them.

Patriot:
Before you write this off as a fantasy, how many of Ursus's defeats and victories have you personally participated in?

'Emperors' Blade':
You're right. My generation hasn't seen much action.

'Emperors' Blade':
Therefore... I am inviting you to join us. Ursus Captain Buldrokkas'tee, I ask you to come with us. Ursus needs you.

Shieldguard:
What's that?!

Talulah:
...What...

'Emperors' Blade':
Having fought under the command of the last emperor for over a hundred years, surely you must remember Ursus's greatness in those times.

'Emperors' Blade':
Was it a prosperous and marvelous era?

'Emperors' Blade':
Everyone united under the banner of Ursus regardless of race, and they all fought for its future. Enemies far and wide fell to our blades and cannon fire, and we stood undefeated in the battlefield.

'Emperors' Blade':
I am far from the only one who wishes to return to those glorious times... All of us want to see again an era when all men are brothers and share the same deep hatred for their enemies.

'Emperors' Blade':
We can bring all those greedy countries to part with the lands they stole, and give the downtrodden the chance to regain their dignity under the glory of Ursus. We conquer not to annihilate, but to rebuild.

'Emperors' Blade':
We gave this world a new lease of life.

'Emperors' Blade':
Let us rebuild that era. With all people united, facing all the storms that come our way together. I do believe it's far better than living your days on the tundra, toiling away.

Shieldguard:
Try saying that to the Ursus folk who toil so oppressed they can't lift up their heads!

'Emperors' Blade':
No one has it easy. Such is the cruelty of the times we live in. Life is difficult for Ursus citizens as well.

'Emperors' Blade':
The lack of order, the loss of power, and the destruction of morals. These are all mistakes.

'Emperors' Blade':
These are the mistakes that ruined Ursus, and we know where the problem lies.

'Emperors' Blade':
We can fix these problems.

Shieldguard:
...Nonsense!

'Emperors' Blade':
You may ask your leader and see if he believes us.

Shieldguard:
You...!

'Emperors' Blade':
Buldrokkas'tee, we can set Ursus on the right path.

Patriot:
You've got one thing wrong. I am not the leader. Not anymore.

Patriot:
She is the leader. Ask her if she believes any of that.

'Emperors' Blade':
......

Patriot:
I fought with your fathers. Your strength and tactical acumen are no less impressive than theirs.

Patriot:
But you look at the Ursus of those times with rose-colored glasses. What you see is nothing more than your wild fantasies.

'Emperors' Blade':
You cannot deny the glory of that era. Everything you did tied you back to Ursus. Even your title symbolizes your desires and aspirations.

Patriot:
Let me ask you this, then. Is there a place for the Infected in that Ursus you are trying to forge for this emperor?

Talulah:
Those positions bestowed upon you as favors are just fickle illusions, nothing more, just like those fantasies of yours!

'Emperors' Blade':
Talulah... *Hiss*.

'Emperors' Blade':
...You are right.

'Emperors' Blade':
Perhaps things will be different with the help of you and your men.

Talulah:
What are... you talking about?

'Emperors' Blade':
Blades do not make promises. Weapons do not ever make promises.

'Emperors' Blade':
But I believe the Infected are a force that Ursus should've possessed in the first place.

'Emperors' Blade':
All of you should strive to become a symbol of Ursus's glory. The Infected who oppose Ursus shall perish. As for all of you, if you are willing to take up arms for Ursus, it will be recognized as a glorious and noble deed.

Talulah can hear the men whispering around her; the murmurs have never been louder.

Patriot:
Just because I don't oppose your theories doesn't mean that I agree with them. Such simplicity is a kind of arrogance.

Patriot:
Perhaps you've come to enjoy having this kind of authority? The kind of freewheeling authority that tells you everything you do is to build a better future? What gives you the right to brag about glory?

'Emperors' Blade':
In that case, if you are fighting for the minority, on what basis are you saying you deserve the majority's endorsement? What is so righteous about your fight for the Infected?

'Emperors' Blade':
Surely you will be able to give me an intelligent answer, Wendigo.

Patriot:
—What does justice even have to do with how many people you got?

Patriot:
Royal Guard, I will ask you just one question. How many people actually loved the Emperor in those days? Was that number high, or low?

'Emperors' Blade':
Hfff...

Patriot:
And did the Emperor's death have anything to do with you?

'Emperors' Blade':
If I answered, 'It had nothing to do with us...'

'Emperors' Blade':
...Hfff...

'Emperors' Blade':
It looks like we won't be coming to an understanding.

Patriot:
In any case, my liege has passed. Ursus now belongs to someone else, and what I follow now is merely an ideology.

Patriot:
—Her ideology.

Patriot helps Talulah up as though she, too, is his family, both right at this moment and for the years to come, until the day when he loses her.

'Emperors' Blade':
*Hiss*...

'Emperors' Blade':
Why her?

Patriot:
Because we know each other well.

Patriot:
Perhaps the road you described is indeed a yellow brick road, but I'm afraid I've already made my decision. I chose the Infected.

Patriot:
A soldier serves his country and his beliefs, not its tyranny. That is why I will destroy this empire and ignite a war of righteousness.

'Emperors' Blade':
We, too, need the support of the Infected, and we are also fighting for a just cause.

'Emperors' Blade':
Why do you refuse us, then?

'Emperors' Blade':
Is it because you believe the path the 'Reunion' is taking you is better than the unity and reform we seek? Because it's more efficient? Or is it perhaps because it hurts the Ursus common folk less?

Patriot:
No, it's simply because the war has already begun, and I need to see it through to the end.

Patriot:
Even the Emperor I served, as benevolent and kind as he was, never accepted the Infected, and these promises are now nothing but lies to me.

Patriot:
If you could truly unite the Infected, then we wouldn't have a war.

'Emperors' Blade':
It is our hope the Infected will unite under your lead.

Patriot:
If you actually wanted to unite them, you wouldn't need me.

Patriot:
Enough, Royal Guards.

Patriot:
I've already walked the path you are singing praises of, and that's why I don't believe there are any 'better choices' out there. If you tell me you had that kind of foresight, it just tells me you haven't yet faced the irony of fate.

Patriot:
One day you will understand. Just like the twenty Royal Guards who died in the Valley of the Setting Sun. They were killed in the tundras and at the hands of foes of other races. It's much better than dying at the hands of your countrymen.

Patriot:
Royal Guards, I am a traitor. I betrayed the Empire. There is no room for us to reconcile.

'Emperors' Blade':
A declaration is nothing more than that, a declaration.

'Emperors' Blade':
Even if that is what you believe, Wendigo, what about the people standing behind you? Will they trust her as much as you do?

'Emperors' Blade':
Even if they revere your might and your honesty, how will you assure them they are not just worshipping a powerful idol?

'Emperors' Blade':
Is an evil idol able to shelter them better, or is an idol who lets herself be trampled upon more preferable?

Patriot:
I hope you aren't trying to use the former as a metaphor for someone whom I respect.

'Emperors' Blade':
Reality is far colder than the flurries of the Northwestern Tundra, Wendigo. Once you lose power... you'll find yourself at the mercy of those who are capable. And the first ones to make that move might not be your enemies.

'Emperors' Blade':
Perhaps they know not who Kashchey is, but they know what a duke is, and they know the duke's daughter will one day become the duchess.

'Emperors' Blade':
The people around you are not like how you see them. Her strength will one day come to rival yours, she will be no less resourceful, and her cunning will be on another level.

Patriot:
I take it you are complimenting her?

'Emperors' Blade':
No, Wendigo, no... You haven't been an Ursus citizen long enough. You don't understand. I am talking about Kashchey.

Patriot:
Just because one inherits the knowledge of corruption doesn't mean they too will fall to it. The footmarks she left on the tundras is proof that she won't meet the same fate as the old snake.

'Emperors' Blade':
*Hiss*... *Huff*...

'Emperors' Blade':
...I've heard stories that you dote on young people, or perhaps pamper is the better term.

Patriot:
I will always have respect for those that are truly worth respecting, now and always, from the moment they were born and through the years, even after their deaths.

Patriot:
Leave.

'Emperors' Blade':
Buldrokkas'tee...

Patriot:
Leave. Right now.

Patriot:
I won't hold it against you for attacking our soldiers for the time being, or I could kill you two right now, wait for the Royal Guards to come and collect your bodies, and go to war with them until only one side remains—

Patriot:
—Even if we find ourselves on the losing side.

'Emperors' Blade':
...Ah. Wendigo... I'm afraid I cannot spill any more secrets.

'Emperors' Blade':
Our warning isn't merely a rhetorical tool, Buldrokkas'tee.

'Emperors' Blade':
We can only mourn for you.

Patriot:
When we find ourselves fighting against each other on the battlefield, I should find myself mourning for you instead.

'Emperors' Blade':
That day won't come, Wendigo. That day won't come.

'Emperors' Blade':
Farewell, 'Patriot.' This day has been unfruitful. How regretful.

'Emperors' Blade':
I should add, Talulah... We look forward to seeing your improvement on the battlefield.

'Emperors' Blade':
You should lead them. You are more than up to the task.

FrostNova:
Daddy...!

Patriot:
Yelena!

FrostNova:
Hah, haah... We... we fought them off... together with the Yetis... Haah...

FrostNova:
We fought off one of them...! But did they... retreat on purpose?

FrostNova:
Was there... five of them altogether? I couldn't... protect my team by myself...

Patriot:
You did fine. You will do better next time.

FrostNova:
I will! Definitely...!

FrostNova:
...What happened here? Why is everyone...?

FrostNova:
Talulah? What happened to... the Shieldguards?

Shieldguard:
...Captain... what they said just now...

Patriot:
They traced some imaginary tracks in history. From that, they determined that the future will be the same as the past, that their statuses decide what the future will hold. That is itself a kind of arrogance.

Patriot:
I can vouch for her, but I am sure not everyone can come to accept this just yet, so I ask you to keep this under wraps for the time being.

Shieldguard:
We know! We all understand! We all know what kind of a person Talulah is.

Shieldguard:
......

Shieldguard:
But... were they telling the truth?

FrostNova:
Don't tell me...

FrostNova:
...What are you thinking? You already said it yourself! A person's upbringing can't determine how you see—

Talulah:
It's true.

FrostNova:
Talulah...

Shieldguard:
......

Talulah:
I was raised by the nobles to one day take over.

Talulah:
There's your answer. Anything else?

Patriot:
My leader.

Talulah:
Please, Patriot, I told you not to call me that. Let's pack it up here... Faust and the crossbowmen still have training after this. You're joining them, aren't you?

Patriot:
As long as you do not disappoint with your character, I will support you until the very end.

Talulah:
Yeah.

FrostNova:
Talulah... My dad supports you.

Talulah:
I won't tell you to do the same for me, Yelena.

FrostNova:
*Sigh*. You don't really think—

Talulah:
Give me a piece of candy.

FrostNova:
Here. I never thought you'd ask me for one of these.

Talulah:
Hm, let's get going.

Talulah:
Let's pack it up, everyone. If you want to know more, I'll tell you everything...

Talulah:
......

Talulah:
Soldiers...?

Infected:
......

Talulah...

What is it that you are planning?
