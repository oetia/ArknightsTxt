Indra:
You saw it, Morgan?

Indra:
The guards at the warehouse were so nervous that they didn't even see me coming.

Morgan:
Alright, alright, you win today. Take your jerky.

Indra:
Ha, knew you'd be cross. Next time you can come with, and loser has to keep guard.

Dagda:
...They're staring at us.

Indra:
Who?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
......

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
You shouldn't have done that.

Morgan:
You mean lure away the Sarkaz patrol, giving your people a chance to escape the warehouse?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Yes.

Morgan:
Funny way to say 'thank you'? Or did I hear you wrong?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Our comrades in Sudean are grateful, and so are we. The mission went well. But why did you have to burn the warehouse?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
It belonged to a Victorian merchant, not the Sarkaz! The Sarkaz were just occupying it.

Indra:
Ha. Those fat cats are as cowardly as they are greedy. They want to help the Sarkaz, I'm happy to make them suffer for it.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
You do understand that you're just driving them into the arms of the Sarkaz?

Indra:
Even better. More than just warehouses to burn for those traitors.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
That's gangster talk, not the way of the Self-Salvation Corps.

Dagda:
......

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Do you still insist on working with these people, Lady Isabelle?

Dagda:
My name is Dagda here.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Er...

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
It's just, Lady Isa—Dagda. When Lady Allerdale introduced you and Her Highness to us, we thought...

Dagda:
Siege told you on day one that it was the Glasgow Gang working with the Corps, not Her Highness Alexandrina and the Knight of the Tower.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Do you really want to see a hoodlum lead us, even take the throne?

Morgan:
What shit-for-brains gives you the right to say that about Vina?

Indra:
Sword back in its place, Morgan! We're on their ground!

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Many of us would rather follow you and Cumberland...

Dagda:
Stuff it! I-I mean, you've said your piece. As long as we still stand together, you should not speak ill of our fellows.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
......

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Sorry, I spoke out of turn.

Morgan:
......

Indra:
......

Morgan:
You shouldn't have stopped me.

Indra:
And let you make a mess for Vina to clean up? Not to mention the bunny and the Doctor from Rhodes Island. Next time, think about your company before you lose your head.

Morgan:
Ha... never thought the day would come that you'd be the one talking to me about losing my head.

Indra:
Gotta change, and adapt to the environment. Look how Dagda is doing.

Dagda:
Don't say that, it feels weird.

Indra:
You think I wanna congratulate you? Living your way doesn't feel too nice.

Indra:
But there's one thing the past couple days've taught me, Morgan. We have to adapt to keep up with Vina.

Morgan:
...Hmph.

Indra:
Here, your jerky. Neither of us won the day.

Morgan:
Keep it. I've got no appetite.

Morgan:
I've been thinking, Hannah... is this the kind of life that Vina wants? Since when did nobles and merchants give her the respect she deserves?

Indra:
You're not thinking from the right angle.

Indra:
They'll realize Vina is a good leader. And the respect Vina gets, she would've earned herself.

Slimy Noble:
Ah, Lady Allerdale! Finally!

Allerdale:
Sorry, I've been busy.

Slimy Noble:
I heard you were looking for a buyer for the Steam Armor?

Allerdale:
...The news reached you quickly.

Slimy Noble:
Only rumors, only rumors. A friend mentioned that a suit of Steam Armor from Londinium might appear on the market.

Slimy Noble:
But the transaction fell through at the last minute.

Allerdale:
...I see.

Slimy Noble:
I would not recommend that you sell something so valuable too easily. It's hard to get a good price under current market conditions.

Allerdale:
Thank you for the advice. I'm just trying to do something useful with what little assets my family has left.

Slimy Noble:
I understand. What little money we have means nothing to the Sarkaz.

Allerdale:
Has the banquet not yet started? There's no need to wait for me.

Slimy Noble:
We can't have that now. You've been the pillar of Central Londinium for ages. It's all thanks to you that we're alive today.

Slimy Noble:
How is one even supposed to negotiate with a bunch of lunatics who don't care about money?

Allerdale:
You flatter me, sir. I'm just a nobody who spoke up a few times at the unjust treatment that those like you have received.

Slimy Noble:
Now, now, don't say that. House Cumberland will undoubtedly rise again under your leadership!

Astute Noble:
Yes, the past is the past now.

Astute Noble:
When Londinium knows peace again—not to say that she's not at peace right now, of course!

Astute Noble:
In any case, House Cumberland will have our gratitude.

Slimy Noble:
Lt. Colonel Lettou is here!

Slimy Noble & Astute Noble:
We salute you!

Lt. Colonel Lettou:
......

Astute Noble:
It's an honor, Lt. Colonel. You have not graced us with your presence for many nights.

Astute Noble:
We are most grateful for your efforts to keep the peace!

Slimy Noble:
I've come into a few bottles of excellent wine.

Slimy Noble:
They may not have been so impressive in the old days, but in times like these they are a rarity. I'll have my butler bring them to your residence.

Lt. Colonel Lettou:
Ladies and gentlemen...

Lt. Colonel Lettou:
There will be no more banquets, from this day forth.

Lt. Colonel Lettou:
The Military Commission will be interviewing you soon. Good luck.

Slimy Noble:
...Huh?

Slimy Noble:
Wait, no! What do you mean?

Astute Noble:
Lt. Colonel Lettou! Lt. Colonel Lettou!

Astute Noble:
Lady Allerdale, you must speak to Lt. Colonel Lettou! This is serious! P-People will die!

Astute Noble:
Lt. Colonel! Please don't go!

Ailshie:
Miss, this is...

Allerdale:
The Sarkaz have been biding their time. They let these fools wallow in luxury in order to keep the dukes from coming together.

Allerdale:
There is nothing any given duke would like more than to become the master of Victoria.

Allerdale:
At the center of Victorian high society is Londinium, and whomever makes an enemy of Londinium nobility makes an enemy of the entire state.

Allerdale:
Such an offense against Victoria would have forced the dukes to put aside their individual interests and join forces to march on Londinium.

Allerdale:
But the Sarkaz don't care anymore.

Allerdale:
They've achieved their goal.

Allerdale:
Some think what befell Londinium the past few years a disaster. But now—

Allerdale:
War has truly come.

Ailshie:
What about us, then?

Ailshie:
Could you talk to Lt. Colonel Lettou, as the nobles suggested? You might...

Allerdale:
They called me 'pillar'. But whom amongst them set foot in Cumberland Manor before the Sarkaz took control of Londinium?

Allerdale:
Which of the Duke's true friends participated in these pretentious banquets?

Allerdale:
I'm simply a figurehead for nobles who lack chips on their side, or those who are trying to protect themselves.

Allerdale:
They flocked to the Cumberland banner, so Cumberland may take the fall for them.

Ailshie:
So what you mean is...

Allerdale:
Let's go, Ailshie. Inform our Self-Salvation Corps and Rhodes Islander friends to evacuate the ducal manor immediately. It is no longer safe.

Allerdale:
We'll take one last look at our ancestral home.

Noble?:
Allerdale.

Allerdale:
You are...

Noble?:
A letter from the duke.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
A few days in Auchterigg, then Highbury. Look at all those factories and houses packed tight together. Never seen a place so cramped.

Paprika:
Can we go back to Central Londinium after this mission, Captain?

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
And do what? I don't know what Manfred was thinking, hiring kids like you who've barely taken a life before...

Paprika:
I'm not a kid! I did a lot of jobs back in Columbia with Grimm, when he was still around!

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Grimm, eh...? I have babysit now because he got himself killed in Sudean. I should've taken his head and nabbed the bounty beforehand.

Paprika:
Er... weren't you friends?

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
It's not my job to teach you how to be a mercenary, kid. But it <i>is</i> yours to read the map. Where do we go next?

Paprika:
Munitions Factory No. 11 is just ahead.

Paprika:
General Manfred gave us a pretty long list... these are all older workers who know something, right? Just take them somewhere with no witnesses and kill them?

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
I would kill everyone in the factory, if it were up to me.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
All that crap about killing only the ones who know anything... does he have any idea how much trouble that is?

Paprika:
Well, he's the boss.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Whatever. Put away the list and let's go.

Londinium Worker:
Feist!

Feist:
Patto.

Londinium Worker:
It's been a year. I missed you.

Feist:
Sorry, I should have tried to send word.

Londinium Worker:
Never mind that. I'm so glad to see you. For the past year, I've been telling everyone that you'd definitely come back alive.

Londinium Worker:
Remember that vent over there? There's a bit of a platform outside the other end of it.

Londinium Worker:
A few years ago, you said you would jump off it and onto the factory next door.

Londinium Worker:
We were scared out of our minds. It was what, more than thirty meters off the ground? Fall, and you'd be dead for sure.

Londinium Worker:
But you dared to jump. And then... Tommy jumped, Day jumped, and in the end I jumped too.

Londinium Worker:
Whenever they ask me if I think you're dead, I tell them to look up at the vent.

Feist:
Haha... we weren't afraid of anything, were we?

Londinium Worker:
So these are your Self-Salvation Corps friends?

Londinium Worker:
Looks well-read to me.

Londinium Worker:
I heard there were all kinds in the Corps. Guess the rumors are true.

Feist:
The Doctor is definitely well-read.

Londinium Worker:
You have partners?

Londinium Worker:
It's sounding more and more like the real deal, isn't it?

Feist:
Haha.

Londinium Worker:
So, why have you come back? Anything I can help with?

Feist:
I—

Catherine:
Patto!

Catherine:
Get back to work.

Londinium Worker:
Yes, ma'am.

Londinium Worker:
But Feist is back, isn't he? He's not going anywhere?

Catherine:
Don't you worry about him right now. As for your friend, we should talk somewhere else.

Feist:
......

Londinium Worker:
Don't blame Catherine, Feist.

Londinium Worker:
She's been protecting us from the Sarkaz for the past year. It's thanks to her that we haven't lost anybody.

Londinium Worker:
There was one time when things got really bad, and she called on the leader of the Defense Forces to mediate.

Londinium Worker:
But the Sarkaz have been putting more pressure on us, on Catherine.

Feist:
I know, Patto.

Feist:
I don't blame Granny one bit.

Feist:
When I joined the Corps and truly understood what I was facing...

Feist:
I knew what a difficult decision Granny had to make.

Catherine:
Alright, talk. What did you come back for?

Feist:
We're looking for something.

Catherine:
Something?

Feist:
Yes. A hidden Sarkaz supply line that's fueling their mad war.

Feist:
We're certain the line ends here in the industrial district.

Feist:
We need to find it.

Feist:
No one knows the district better than you, Granny. I'm sure you can help.

Feist:
That's why I came to you.

Catherine:
Flattering me won't do you any good.

Feist:
Yes, we won't cause any trouble for the factory.

Catherine:
Why do you think I would help you?

Catherine:
Maybe I already told Patto to call the Sarkaz mercenaries.

Feist:
......

Feist:
If that's the case... I'll have to flee with the others.

Catherine:
Tell me, how many died in that incident you caused in Sudean?

Feist:
......

Catherine:
Do you remember their names? Their faces? Do you remember what they looked like when they died? Their last words?

Feist:
I...

Catherine:
Don't rush your answer, Feist. And don't try to bluff your way through it.

Catherine:
I don't know what this 'Doctor' of yours thinks, but I know you. You think you're smart, but being smart isn't enough to fool death.

Londinium Worker:
Catherine! A bunch of Sarkaz just showed up at the door...

Feist:
...?!

Feist:
Doctor, we need to get out of here—

Londinium Worker:
They say Lt. Colonel Lettou, a Defense Force officer, wants to see you. You're to be escorted.

Feist:
...What?

Catherine:
......

Catherine:
George, watch these two and make sure they stay put.

Catherine:
Care for a smoke?

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Don't bother trying to butter me up.

Catherine:
Lt. Colonel Lettou wants to see me?

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Yes.

Catherine:
We've been meeting our targets. Nothing for him to worry about.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Whatever. He wants to see you. Come with us.

Catherine:
......

Catherine:
Give me a minute. I have something to take care of first.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
We're not asking, old bag.

Catherine:
I have to put someone in charge. This is very sudden, after all.

Paprika:
We can wait a little bit... can't we?

Paprika:
(Whisper) I don't think the General wants a scene.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Ugh. You have ten minutes.

Catherine:
Good enough.

Feist:
Granny, why are they looking for you?

Catherine:
None of your business.

Feist:
But—

Catherine:
Shut up and come with me.
