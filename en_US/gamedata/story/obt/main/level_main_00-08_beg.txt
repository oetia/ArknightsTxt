Crownslayer:
Mephisto?

???:
You have no reason to object, right? Just a few insects that flew too close to the light... are they really worth your time?

???:
My troops have already received your info. You've already done your part.

???:
All that's left for you to do is to go home. After all, you're just responsible for the core energy sector and its surroundings...

Crownslayer:
Don't do anything unnecessary...!

???:
You still have somewhere else to be, don't you?

Crownslayer:
...

Crownslayer:
Fine. Have it your way.

Crownslayer:
I can't wait to see you fail.

???:
Oh...?

Crownslayer:
We're leaving.

Reunion Member:
...

Amiya:
One of the enemy leaders... just took a portion of the Reunion troops and left?

Dobermann:
What are they up to?

Dobermann:
Whatever it is, we can't let our guard down... The enemy is still many times our size!

???:
Well, well. Please allow me to apologize on Crownslayer's behalf for her rudeness.

Mephisto:
You can call me Mephisto.

Dobermann:
What is Reunion trying to accomplish?

Mephisto:
Oh, nothing in particular. To be honest, I wouldn't even mind letting you bunch go. You weren't even our targets in the first place.

Amiya:
If we weren't your targets, then why...

Mephisto:
However, I had the honor of watching your battles.

Mephisto:
Your combat tactics as well as your personnel configuration were quite intriguing.

Medic:
...Intriguing?

Medic:
You think that the carnage of battle is... intriguing?

Mephisto:
Rhodes Island... I've read up on your group before.

Mephisto:
At first, I thought you were just another ordinary company.

Mephisto:
But by the looks of things, don't you think your ambitions have stretched a bit too far from playing with test tubes?

Mephisto:
It'd be terribly dull if I allowed you to just walk out of here, wouldn't it?

Mephisto:
What I'd like is to have a little competition, a ritual of sorts.

Dobermann:
...We don't have time to waste on a preoperational kid.

Dobermann:
(Amiya, get ready. We might have to break through with force.)

Dobermann:
(I'll get his attention...!)

Amiya:
(Mm, okay!)

Mephisto:
...What was that just now? Who were you sending a signal to?

Dobermann:
None of your business, kid.

Dobermann:
(Amiya?)

Mephisto:
Come on, we're all professionals here. Where's your basic courtesy?

Dobermann:
If people like you didn't exist, I wouldn't have to constantly be honing my insults!

Dobermann:
(Amiya, what's going on?)

Amiya:
(Dobermann... All of our escape routes have been blocked by his troops!)

Dobermann:
(How can that be?! How did he manage to do that in just a few minutes--)

Mephisto:
This simply won't do.

Mephisto:
Even though I gave you my sincere invitation...

Mephisto:
But all you can think of...

Mephisto:
...is running away?!

Dobermann:
Tsk...!

Mephisto:
Actually, I'll let you leave my hunting grounds safely as long as you win.

Mephisto:
Until then, my friends here will keep trying to kill you.

Mephisto:
It's your victory as long as you don't die! The rules are simple enough, right?

Dobermann:
Ace!

Ace:
We're already prepared to break through.

Ace:
But we have to stave off their attacks first!

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Why are you doing this? The Catastrophe is coming! If we don't leave Chernobog, then everyone will--

Mephisto:
What are you talking about...

Mephisto:
The Catastrophe... makes it the best time to celebrate.

Amiya:
You're sick...

Mephisto:
My esteemed guests, I am honored to invite you to this game.

Reunion Member:
Argh... Argh...!

Reunion Member:
Kill... Kill! ! Kill... them all!!

Dobermann:
Amiya! Watch out!

Mephisto:
Right, right...

Mephisto:
Actually, we know exactly what you did in the central area.

Amiya:
...!

Mephisto:
That masked person you rescued... makes me very, very curious.

Amiya:
â€”?!

Mephisto:
Crownslayer is so fixated on what you're going to do next, where you're going to go.

Mephisto:
But I'm different. What I care about is...

Mephisto:
What exactly are you? Where are you from?

Mephisto:
Yes, you. The one staring at me right now... You are somewhat different from us.

Mephisto:
What was the device in that facility that was able to preserve your life?

Mephisto:
I am so, very curious.

Mephisto:
See, I'm not such a cold-blooded person...

Mephisto:
So how about it, my esteemed Rhodes Island guests, how about giving this person to me as a gift?

Mephisto:
It would be a shame to end the game early, but at least I'll let the rest of you go. How about it?

Amiya:
Doctor...

Amiya:
Get behind me!!
