Dobermann:
*gasp* *gasp*...

Nearl:
We made it...!

Nearl:
We've not only managed to shake off Reunion...

Nearl:
...but the Catastrophe is also visibly weakening!

Nearl:
But we're still in a terrible situation... Everyone, continue to exercise caution!

Amiya:
The Catastrophe...

Amiya:
The streets are now buried underneath rubble, and collapsed buildings are blocking all the roads...

Dobermann:
Is the Originium already beginning to metastasize...?

Dobermann:
We're almost there, but everything is blocking our way!

Dobermann:
If we can just...

Dobermann:
... Just...

Ace:
——

Ace:
They're here.

Guard:
What's here?

Guard:
Reunion? They caught up to us? !

Medic:
Ugh...

Medic:
There's... so many of them...

Dobermann:
They didn't just catch up to us...

Dobermann:
They're...

Nearl:
--Everywhere.

Dobermann:
From the plaza, the streets, the buildings... and even all the ruins.

Dobermann:
Look at those numbers. Hah...

Dobermann:
That explains why they weren't afraid of the Catastrophe at all, except for the ones who ended up being crushed.

Dobermann:
Even if we assume...

Dobermann:
That the Catastrophe wiped out half their men--

Dobermann:
They still have enough people here to kill us a dozen times over.

Nearl:
...

Nearl:
Don't stop moving! We'll continue moving towards our retreat route!

Nearl:
We're done for if we stop in a wide-open area! At least make it to the plaza's exit before regrouping!

Amiya:
Nearl...

Nearl:
We have to fight. After we break through their line, we'll slip out in the ensuing chaos.

Amiya:
Are you sure it'll work?

Nearl:
The chance is slim, but we're out of options. But...

Nearl:
Even if they outnumber us ten-to-one, if they're just a bunch of thugs, we still have a chance!

Nearl:
Stay calm! Prepare for battle! Defensive formations!

Dobermann:
...Tsk.

Dobermann:
With these numbers, if they wanted to take over Chernobog... they might actually be able to do it.

Nearl:
There are too many...

Nearl:
Way too many of them..

Nearl:
Where did Reunion find all these Infected?

Dobermann:
We're completely surrounded...

Dobermann:
I never asked for this kind of respect from Reunion.

Guard:
The entire plaza... is swarming with Reunion forces!

Guard:
They've stopped moving!

Guard:
...

Amiya:
Ugh...

Guard:
Only a single enemy is approaching our defensive line!

Guard:
Why is that person walking towards us alone...

Guard:
Are they sending an envoy? I don't think so...

Amiya:
She...

Amiya:
According to our intel, she's...

Nearl:
...

Nearl:
There's something peculiar about her scent.

Dobermann:
Nearl...

Nearl:
I can't exactly put my finger on it, but...

Nearl:
It's... the smell of steel and sulfur.

Nearl:
As if something was burning.

Nearl:
If it really is fire, then...

Amiya:
All Operators... be on maximum alert.

Amiya:
...That person is...

Dobermann:
Reunion's ruler...

Amiya:
...Talulah.

Talulah:
...

Talulah:
... ...

Nearl:
I reckon... her flames are powerful enough to swallow Terra entirely.
