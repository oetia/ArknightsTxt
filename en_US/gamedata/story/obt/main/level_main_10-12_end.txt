Manfred:
Have you finished cleaning up the streets?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Yes, General. Everyone on the list has already been dealt with.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Some tried to flee to other boroughs or leave the city just as you said, and we stopped them as well.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Only a few slipped through our net... The soldiers sent to chase after them seemingly ran into the same Sarkaz from Rhodes Island as yesterday.

Manfred:
Let them squirm their way underground.

Manfred:
That'll make it easier for us to flush them all out at once.

Clovisia:
...Multiple of our contact points above ground were attacked all at once?

Clovisia:
What of our Messengers? They got taken as well?

Clovisia:
......

Clovisia:
Doctor, I want to hear your view on this.

Clovisia:
The only ones with access to that information are our own troops.

Clovisia:
It seems the seeds of crisis were sown last night.

Clovisia:
But I don't want to doubt our own soldiers.

Clovisia:
There's no way they'd betray their brothers and sisters.

Clovisia:
Twelve people came back with Heidi.

Clovisia:
Among them, nine only ever provided us information on occasion.

Clovisia:
The other three helped us transport supplies, so it is possible they know the locations of some contact points.

Clovisia:
...A lot more.

Clovisia:
Doctor, you know better than anyone how difficult last night's operation was. As much as I'd like to rescue everyone, I'm forced to admit that we're not yet strong enough.

Clovisia:
Heidi's done good work. Being able to save all those people already went above and beyond my expectations.

Clovisia:
There were a lot of uncertainties surrounding our operation last night...

Clovisia:
I doubt the Sarkaz could have full control over everything.

Clovisia:
That's simply not possible.

Clovisia:
That's right.

Clovisia:
The Sarkaz commander isn't a fool. He would have found a way to make sure his plan succeeded.

Clovisia:
So, if there really were traitors among the soldiers we saved...

Clovisia:
In all likelihood, they would've been the easiest for us to rescue.

Clovisia:
Still, I don't want to fling these accusations around about soldiers willing to bleed and die for their homeland.

Clovisia:
We need proof.

Clovisia:
How do you suppose we get that, Doctor?

Feist:
......

Rockrock:
Why aren't you moving? The commander just sent news that Bill's about to wake up.

Feist:
...Rockrock.

Feist:
I want to tell her that I'm stepping down as captain of the operation team.

Rockrock:
......

Rockrock:
Take a look at these.

Feist:
Packages? What's inside them?

Rockrock:
Johnny and Gabby's belongings. I picked out the stuff to send back to their families.

Rockrock:
What remains are their tools, weapons, and equipment. If you really... can't get them out of your head, then pick out something useful and polish it up a bit. That way they'll at least still be with us on the battlefield.

Feist:
......

Feist:
Hah...

Feist:
Sounds like the vice-captain rejected my resignation... Let's go see Bill then.

Amiya:
You're awake?

Bill:
Yeah.

Amiya:
Something came up, so Miss Heidi had to leave. She was originally the one in charge of coordinating the treatment of the wounded here.

Amiya:
Wait, you're from Mr. Feist's team. Bill, right?

Amiya:
Mr. Bill, should I go call Feist and Rockrock over?

Bill:
Ah, no, that's alright.

Bill:
Miss Amiya, I decided to get up to talk to you.

Amiya:
...Huh?

Bill:
Well, uh... I've always been curious about you.

Bill:
Amiya of Rhodes Island...

Bill:
Why do they trust you so much? You're just a Cautus in her teens.

Amiya:
Are you... talking about our operators?

Amiya:
We've been through so much together. You're correct that they trust me, but that trust is mutual.

Amiya:
As far as I can tell, it's no different for everyone in the Self-Salvation Corps either. You also trust Feist, Rockrock, and Clovisia, right?

Bill:
Haha... Mutual trust, huh? That might be a part of it. After all, you've been through your share of trials and tribulations.

Bill:
But your authority does not come from your bloodline, nor have you taken your position by force. You are far too young to have earned the amount of trust you enjoy.

Amiya:
...Mr. Bill?

Bill:
Deep down, you've thought about these things too, haven't you? But you don't dare show it. Your fears, your worries, your anxiety... Everything is suppressed by the responsibilities they've forced onto you.

Amiya:
Are you worried about me? Did you overhear my conversation with Miss Heidi?

Bill:
Mm... Maybe. I heard everything.

Amiya:
I appreciate the concern, but my responsibilities were not forced onto me.

Amiya:
Our operators placed their faith in me, and I am not going to let them down.

Bill:
Of course... Of course. Since the very beginning, they've always been devoted to you.

Bill:
But Amiya... When they look at you, how do you know that they're not looking right past you? Searching for another soul that has endured the twists and turns of fate?

Amiya:
......!

Bill:
Everything you believe, do you truly believe it, or...

Bill:
Are you dreaming a dream given to you by somebody else... one that you can't wake up from no matter how much you struggle?

Amiya:
Mr. Bill... No, that's not who you are!

Amiya:
Who exactly are you?

Bill:
Allow me to return the question.

Bill:
Amiya... Who are you?

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
You shouldn't be here.

Bill:
I see the energy gathering inside your palm. Have you not figured out who I am? Why aren't you attacking?

Amiya:
I cannot touch your emotions, 'Mr. Bill'.

Amiya:
But... I also cannot feel any malice.

Bill:
Oh?

Amiya:
You could have continued pretending to be asleep, yet you said all those things to me...

Bill:
Hah, didn't I already tell you? We are very curious about you.

Bill:
If not for you, we'd have no desire to come here either. Theresis has no sway over us.

Amiya:
No matter what you're after... this is far too cruel.

Bill:
Cruel...?

Bill:
Do you mean this face we're borrowing?

Amiya:
Yes, which is why I need you to leave.

Black lines surged from her palm once more, weaving a net around the man in the Self-Salvation Corps uniform.

One strand condensed into a lightless blade, pressed against his throat.

Bill:
What a... remarkably gentle threat.

Bill:
Amiya, a lot of people have told you this before, yes?

Bill:
You really are just like her.

Amiya:
Not another word out of you, please.

Bill:
Unfortunately, you're still too immature.

Bill:
Always be aware of your surroundings before you make a move.

Feist:
...Miss Amiya?!

Feist:
You, you... you're trying to kill Bill?

Amiya:
No, I...

Feist:
......

Clovisia:
Doctor, I take it that you didn't ask me to bring everyone here just to see this scene?

Clovisia:
I assume you're not referring to Amiya. Then, Bill?

Bill:
Rockrock... Rockrock, help me...

Rockrock:
......

Bill:
I'd rather die myself... than betray you!

Amiya:
Stay away from him. I... No, nobody knows the full extent of his Originium Arts.

Amiya:
His words are, or rather his very existence is... dangerous.

Rockrock:
Miss Amiya... Can I trust you?

Rockrock:
Last night, we fought side-by-side. I thought Rhodes Island truly had our backs, just as you said.

Rockrock:
But...

Amiya:
......

Rockrock:
Your expression scares me. It's as if I've seen it somewhere before...

Rockrock:
That's right, you're already mourning the pain and suffering you're about to cause.

Rockrock:
If so, then... why? Why go through with it?!

Rockrock:
She... The Sarkaz took my father from me, right before my eyes. Are you going to take my family away too?

Amiya:
I'm sorry, Miss Rockrock... But it's too late. Your family member's already gone.

Rockrock:
But, Bill's right in front of us!

Amiya:
This must be difficult... for you to accept.

Rockrock:
...I don't understand.

Clovisia:
Look, Amiya, it's not that we're not willing to believe you, but we don't have your Arts. We can't see what you see.

Feist:
......

Feist:
Commander... I can see it.

Rockrock:
Captain?

Feist:
He might not actually be the same Bill we know.

Rockrock:
But those wounds on his body... he got all those from saving me yesterday!

Feist:
You said it yourself, Rockrock. The Sarkaz are masters of disguise, but we can't let ourselves be fooled.

Rockrock:
But how...?

Feist:
Look, I brought along the Metal Crab I was going to give to Bill.

Feist:
See for yourself.

Bill:
Ugh, when did this thing crawl onto me?

Feist:
He didn't even spare it a glance. The only thing in his eyes is Miss Amiya. He's so proud of having deceived us that he's long forgotten... about the bond between us.

Rockrock:
......

Bill:
All because of this insignificant little machine?

Bill:
Don't you think you're being a bit too hasty, Feist? Aren't we sworn blood brothers?

Feist:
I've made a lot of hasty decisions these last few days.

Feist:
Bill, my good man... if he were still around, he'd be ruthlessly making fun of me. I miss him. I miss him so much.

Feist:
Whoever you are... Don't make me pry that mask off your face with my wrench.

Bill:
Rockrock, are you going to break my heart, just like him?

Rockrock:
I'll never turn my back on my family.

Rockrock:
But you... you're acting less and less like him.

Rockrock:
He would never talk like that. He would never try to manipulate us.

Bill:
...So you really don't think I'm the real Bill? Feist, are you really okay with that?

Bill:
I'll have you know, if so, then that means your friend died in vain.

Feist:
......

Feist:
Anyone else may have the right to say that, but you sure as hell don't!

Bill:
Haha. You're pretty smart, but unfortunately for you...

Bill:
It's too late.

Manfred:
Artilleryman, are you ready?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Yes, General. The cannon is aimed at the target.

Manfred:
Remember, we're leveling every single building except the train station and the tracks.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Yessir!

Manfred:
Increase the output to maximum.

Sarkaz Warrior:
M-Maximum? That might blow right through to the structural levels—

Manfred:
Did you hear what the Confessarius's Messenger said? In their eyes, this whole tract of land, including the factories above, is worth nothing to us.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Then... Then, what about our people underneath...?

Manfred:
Hoederer will guard the safe areas under the city walls.

Sarkaz Warrior:
But what about—

Manfred:
Uhh... Who do you think is heading underground to deal with the rebels?

Sarkaz Warrior:
The Sanguinarch?

Manfred:
As long as you get it. If these toys can take HIM out, I'd be... extremely surprised.

Manfred:
As for the other one...

Manfred:
I've been curious for a while now. If it came to an all-out battle with the Prince, who would come out on top?

Closure:
Thank goodness you're all here—

Closure:
Huh? Why does it feel like I walked right into a fight about to break out?

Closure:
Anyway Doctor, I sent up some drones like you requested— They're really about to resume! Th-They're pointing those cannons right at us!

Clovisia:
Notify Heidi and Harmo. We're evacuating immediately.

Closure:
Hold on, I'm getting a strong Originium reading! They're aiming at our current location!

Closure:
We've only got ten seconds!

Closure:
Nine—

Bill?:
—Why are you holding on to me?

Feist:
You said it yourself, we're sworn blood brothers. I don't want to... pass judgment too hastily.

Rockrock:
Captain... I don't think... I can carry the two of you...

Bill?:
......

Bill?:
I'll admit that you people are very... interesting.

Bill?:
Goodbye, Captain.

Bill?:
Goodbye, Rockrock.

Bill?:
Bill wanted you to live on. Those were his last words.
