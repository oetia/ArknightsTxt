Amiya:
Dr. {@nickname}...

Amiya:
I... I didn't mean to... I...

Hoshiguma:
The fog has dispersed.

Hoshiguma:
We've received communications from the L.G.D. They found more Reunion movements.

Hoshiguma:
They're currently tracking down one enemy, described as female with white hair--

Amiya:
...

Hoshiguma:
Amiya, Ch'en told me that she wanted you to...

Hoshiguma:
...

Hoshiguma:
...You don't look so good.

Hoshiguma:
Well...

Hoshiguma:
I'll leave her to you, Dr. {@nickname}.

Hoshiguma:
It'd be ideal to leave within 5 minutes.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Dr. {@nickname}...

Amiya:
Huh...? I...

Amiya:
Doctor... it's not like I'm afraid or anything...

Amiya:
Of course, I'm afraid... of losing you again... That's why...

Amiya:
I just... didn't mean to...

Amiya:
I... I just don't know...

Amiya:
I don't know if I should be saying this, but...

Amiya:
It shouldn't... only be hurting other people.

Amiya:
I don't want you to see me like this, up close...

Amiya:
...I took someone's life.

Amiya:
I feel no regret.

Amiya:
No, what I mean is...

Amiya:
I will always use my power for your sake. No matter what kind of burden he was carrying, I don't regret killing him.

Amiya:
But... there should have been a better way.

Amiya:
He died because... I wasn't able to find it.

Amiya:
And that... is eating me up inside.

Amiya:
I don't want...

Amiya:
I don't want you to see this side of me, {@nickname}.

Amiya:
Even though I've always talked about freeing the Infected from pain and suffering...

Amiya:
But when matters the most, I have to persuade myself, again and again, that it's justified to take the life of another Infected.

Amiya:
I am truly pathetic.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...This was my duty.

Amiya:
I understand.

Amiya:
I never believed that anything was already determined by fate.

Amiya:
But, no matter what happens... no matter what I become...

Amiya:
I'll always protect you, Doctor.

Amiya:
I promise.

Reunion Member:
No!

Reunion Member:
You all go first!

Reunion Member:
I need to... I need to bring Skullshatterer back!

Reunion Member:
Are you insane?

Reunion Member:
That's suicide... If you're going, we're all going together!

Reunion Member:
All right!

Reunion Member:
I can't leave him alone out there...

Reunion Member:
Let's go then!

Hoshiguma:
Why...

Hoshiguma:
Why is Reunion... turning back around?

Hoshiguma:
What are they doing...?!

Amiya:
Madam Hoshiguma! Fall back!

Hoshiguma:
L.G.D., don't panic!

Hoshiguma:
Prepare for enemy attack!

Reunion Member:
Cover! Cover me!

Reunion Member:
That woman...

Reunion Member:
It's impossible... We can't get past her shield!

Reunion Member:
Quick! Wrap around, before they have a chance to react...

Reunion Member:
We have to get to Skullshatterer... and bring him...

Reunion Member:
And bring him home!!

Hoshiguma:
Rhodes Island! They're changing their target, watch out!

Amiya:
Oh no!

Amiya:
Madam Hoshiguma! Watch your right!

Hoshiguma:
Huh...?

W:
Hehe, you managed to block that? That's a bit interesting...

Hoshiguma:
An explosion? Another Reunion ambush?!

W:
Not just that, of course~

W:
I'd like you to behave yourself and stay put right here. Don't think about turning back, all right?

Hoshiguma:
Tsk... Where the hell did you come from?!

Hoshiguma:
Again with those explosives...!

Hoshiguma:
Amiya! I'm getting bombarded by Reunion!

Hoshiguma:
Their forces are currently headed your way!

W:
Hmm, that shield of yours is pretty sturdy.

W:
Seems like I've gotten myself into a bit of trouble...

W:
Whatever, I'll just treat it like I'm doing Reunion a little favor.

W:
Show me something entertaining. Make sure you don't let me down~

Amiya:
That's the 'W' person who we saw at Chernobog!

Amiya:
Could she... have managed to shake off Madam Ch'en? !

Amiya:
Be careful of the enemy assault! We've got to help Madam Hoshiguma right away!

Amiya:
There are many more enemies hiding nearby!

Amiya:
We won't be able to get the upper hand unless we reveal them!

Amiya:
Doctor! Please lead our squads and hold off the enemy assault!
