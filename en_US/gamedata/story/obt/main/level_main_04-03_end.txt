Reunion Member:
Get moving! ...

Jessica:
What's going on...?

Frostleaf:
(Don't make a sound!)

Jessica:
(Nnnh---)

Frostleaf:
(Are they still around?)

Meteorite:
(They're still here...!)

Meteorite:
(They seem to searching for something...)

Meteorite:
(A Reunion member is headed our way! We need to hide!)

Reunion Member:
...

Reunion Member:
Must be my imagination.

Frostleaf:
(Can you get a clear shot on him?)

Meteorite:
(We're too far away...)

Meteorite:
(The explosions stopped as soon as they appeared...)

Meteorite:
(They're too spread out. There's no way I'd be able to take out all three at once.)

Meteorite:
(Also, their movements are nothing like those ordinary street thugs.)

Jessica:
(The other Reunion troops don't seem to be dressed as heavily.)

Meteorite:
(That's right. As you can see, we must be extremely careful. If any of them survive and call for reinforcements, we'll be in serious danger.)

Meteorite:
(On top of that, I see one person over there in Caster attire, and they seem to be testing something.)

Meteorite:
(If they're also able to use Detection Arts...)

Meteorite:
(They might be able to detect us just based upon a bullet we fire.)

Frostleaf:
(So basically, our hands are tied. Even though it's a three versus three, it feels like we've been surrounded.)

Meteorite:
(Things aren't looking good. I really dislike this kind of feeling.)

Meteorite:
(Though we're supposed to be the hunters, it feels like all we've been cornered into hiding by bigger prey.)

Meteorite:
(Wait, they seem to be communicating with someone...)

Frostleaf:
(I can't hear what they're saying from here. I'm going to get closer.)

Meteorite:
(Don't. It's too risky right now.)

Meteorite:
(It's too quiet. We don't know what kinds of Infected we're facing yet...)

Meteorite:
(If any of them have enhanced hearing, we'll be in trouble.)

Meteorite:
(...What are they waiting for?)

Meteorite:
(Something feels... off about this.)

Meteorite:
(Could it be...)

Meteorite:
(Jessica, are you feeling it too...?)

Jessica:
(Y-yeah... I'm also...)

Jessica:
(The temperature is dropping again...)

Jessica:
(So... cold...)

Meteorite:
(Could they be behind this...?!)

Meteorite:
(...! Jessica, why are you biting your fingers--)

Frostleaf:
(So that her teeth don't chatter and make noise.)

Frostleaf:
(I don't think that's necessary yet, but what a diligent kid.)

Meteorite:
(To me, you're just a kid too.)

Frostleaf:
(...Hah.)

Frostleaf:
(As if.)

Meteorite:
(...It's warming back up again. Those three Reunion members left as well.)

Meteorite:
Are they testing the functionality of something...?

Meteorite:
...They appeared without making a sound, only leaving a trail of shivering cold in their wake.

Meteorite:
They really are like those 'yetis' from legend.

Frostleaf:
Maybe my guess was right.

Frostleaf:
They might just be yetis.

Frostleaf:
...Found it.

Frostleaf:
Here's another wall that's been affected by the ice. But, look at this...

Meteorite:
There's a chunk of black Originium lodged in the corner?

Meteorite:
No wonder. The cold wave must have emanated from here.

Frostleaf:
There are distinct patterns on the wall.

Frostleaf:
This chunk of Originium is the epicenter of all this.

Frostleaf:
...When I was a mercenary, there was a rumor circulating around.

Frostleaf:
In the northwest, the Infected were carrying out guerilla warfare against Ursus.

Frostleaf:
Among them was a towering monster.

Frostleaf:
As the rumor went, nothing could hold off its advance.

Frostleaf:
Shields would be crumpled, weapons would be snapped.

Frostleaf:
Everywhere the monster went, only a barren tundra, devoid of life, would remain.

Frostleaf:
And within that guerilla force, there was this one squad...

Frostleaf:
They were like the chill of winter itself.

Frostleaf:
The land was said to freeze underneath their feet.

Frostleaf:
Buildings would collapse, turned into nothing more than grains of snow drifting across an empty battlefield.

Frostleaf:
The trenches where the Ursus soldiers were stationed became their icy grave.

Meteorite:
Are you saying that...

Frostleaf:
Yes. I think this is that very legend...

Frostleaf:
...the 'Yeti Squadron.'

Frostleaf:
Let's keep going. I have a feeling that we're going to find the Reunion base soon.

Jessica:
Ugh...

Meteorite:
What's wrong?

Jessica:
Do you smell that as well...

Jessica:
...the smell of something burning?
