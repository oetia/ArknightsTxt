Rhodes Island

Kal'tsit:
Welcome back.

Amiya:
...Mm.

Kal'tsit:
...

Kal'tsit:
I already heard what happened from the recon squad.

Kal'tsit:
Amiya, let me check your hands.

Amiya:
There's no need for that, Dr. Kal'tsit...

Kal'tsit:
Amiya.

Amiya:
I, I...

Amiya:
...All right.

Kal'tsit:
...

Kal'tsit:
It looks fine. The rings haven't cracked or discolored.

Kal'tsit:
But it might be different next time.

Kal'tsit:
Listen closely, Amiya...

Kal'tsit:
Be a little more careful.

Amiya:
Dr. Kal'tsit, I...

Amiya:
...I need some rest.

Kal'tsit:
Go ahead.

Amiya:
Mm...

Kal'tsit:
...

Kal'tsit:
Never put Amiya in this much risk again.

Kal'tsit:
You are also responsible for what happened.

Kal'tsit:
When you first came back to Rhodes Island, she looked a bit like this.

Kal'tsit:
These emotions never really left Amiya.

Kal'tsit:
This has to change.

Kal'tsit:
...Dr. {@nickname}, you should stay with her.

Kal'tsit:
Don't mess up.

Amiya:
It's open.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Dr. {@nickname}...?

Amiya:
Worried? I am?

Amiya:
...You saw right through me, hehe...

Amiya:
I thought I did a good job hiding it.

Amiya:
Yes, I'm a bit worried... just a little, though.

Amiya:
I'm already used to doing this.

Amiya:
After all, I can't drag down everyone else any more.

Amiya:
Right, Doctor?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...I don't understand.

Amiya:
Doctor... I don't understand.

Amiya:
No, I... I know what we're trying to do. I also know... that some sacrifices are inevitable.

Amiya:
But I... what I don't know is...

Amiya:
Why must I watch people disappear before my eyes one by one... even though they can be saved?

Amiya:
We were so close... Maybe just a little bit more...

Amiya:
I know that I have a duty... and I will continue to move forward...

Amiya:
But right now... I just feel so tired.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Please let me have some time alone, Dr. {@nickname}.

Amiya:
Thank you.

Amiya:
Good morning, Dr. {@nickname}.

Amiya:
Oh, Dr. Kal'tsit, you're here as well?

Kal'tsit:
Amiya.

Kal'tsit:
I have a rather urgent mission here, and need some people to help out.

Kal'tsit:
An abandoned city was discovered not far from Lungmen.

Kal'tsit:
I surmise that it's one of the cities that formed in the aftermath of the Chernobog incident.

Kal'tsit:
We'll have to explore that city, uncover more information, and search for any survivors.

Kal'tsit:
If the situation is particularly serious, for example, if Reunion is hiding there, then there may be serious ramifications on our future operations.

Kal'tsit:
Here's the specific proposal that I have in mind. Look over it when you have time.

Amiya:
Understood.

Kal'tsit:
Oh, one more thing.

Kal'tsit:
Franka submitted a report to me mentioning that they had to return to Blacksteel.

Kal'tsit:
As for the situation in the Lungmen slums, Penguin Logistics requested for you to meet them there to discuss some information.

Kal'tsit:
There are some more sensitive details, so it'd be best for you to go in person.

Amiya:
I know. I'll head over right now.

Amiya:
Doctor, let's go--

Kal'tsit:
I still have some things to discuss with Dr. {@nickname}.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
May I listen in?

Kal'tsit:
You may not.

Amiya:
I can cover my ears...

Kal'tsit:
You cannot. You should get going.

Amiya:
Aww...

Amiya:
Dr. Kal'tsit, you're not allowed to bully Dr. {@nickname}.

Kal'tsit:
I won't.

Kal'tsit:
...You...

Kal'tsit:
You couldn't even do something so basic.

Kal'tsit:
Forget it, I had a feeling this would happen.

Kal'tsit:
Amiya is an incredibly resilient kid.

Kal'tsit:
But, if she has to force herself to be strong, there will come a day when the pressure breaks her.

Kal'tsit:
Do not let this happen.

Kal'tsit:
If there is a next time, you'd better be a little more useful.

Kal'tsit:
--?

Kal'tsit:
What's with that face?

Kal'tsit:
It's related to the state of her health.

Kal'tsit:
If Amiya is involved in an intense battle...

Kal'tsit:
...You must check her rings immediately afterwards.

Kal'tsit:
No matter what changes you see, you must report them to me.

Kal'tsit:
For the time being, that's all you're allowed to know.

Kal'tsit:
Oh, right. You have to go down to the medical center in two days to have a physical done. Don't forget it.

Kal'tsit:
...You can go. Liskarm is waiting outside to escort you.
