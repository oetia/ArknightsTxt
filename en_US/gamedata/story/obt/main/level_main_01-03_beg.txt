Dr. {@nickname} Rescue Operation, Phase 3

Dobermann:
We have less than an hour left. We can't afford to make a detour...

Dobermann:
The more time we waste, the more like we are to get caught in the Catastrophe.

Dobermann:
We must directly cut across this area.

Dobermann:
However, we won't be able to conceal our movements anymore given the size of our forces.

Dobermann:
The possibility of getting ambushed when we're navigating through narrow streets is very high...

Nearl:
What's the plan?

Dobermann:
We don't have many options...

Dobermann:
Dr. {@nickname}, what's your assessment?

Dobermann:
Reunion's forces are no match for us individually.

Dobermann:
But most of the time, they try to overwhelm us with sheer numbers.

Nearl:
If we can utilize our speed to constantly press forward while avoiding large-scale fights...

Dobermann:
They don't seem to have built any fortifications.

Nearl:
If we're able to charge through their blockade...

Dobermann:
Even though it looks like they have a numbers advantage, their loose formation won't be able to stop our advance.

Dobermann:
From what I've observed through our past battles, Reunion's communication methods are absolutely primitive.

Nearl:
If we do this quickly, by the time they're able to regroup and mount an effort to stop us...

Dobermann:
We'll already be long gone by the time they get into formation.

Nearl:
Sounds good.

Nearl:
We'll storm them, disrupt their formation, destroy their firebase, and then fall back quickly.

Nearl:
Dobermann, are you testing me, or...

Dobermann:
It's far easier to deal with threats we can see than to be stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Dobermann:
I take it that these are Dr. {@nickname}'s orders, Amiya?

Amiya:
The situation is clear. I trust Doctor's decisions...

Dobermann:
...Trust isn't built so easily from just a single battle.

Dobermann:
I do think highly of Dr. {@nickname}, Amiya...

Dobermann:
But don't let your guard down. Of course, there is nothing wrong with learning from the Doctor's wisdom, but remember, you can't fully rely on anyone else in this world.

Amiya:
...I know.

Dobermann:
Don't get me wrong, Doctor, I'm not trying to make things difficult for you.

Dobermann:
But I hope you understand... Amiya still needs to learn and grow.

Dobermann:
If you were in my position, you also wouldn't allow her to rely on someone else.

Dobermann:
However, know that I've already acknowledged your abilities as a commander.

Dobermann:
Also, there's no reason to be so formal. We're comrades-in-arms now.

Dobermann:
At least on the battlefield, I've already entrusted my life to you.

Dobermann:
Enough with the chit-chatting though, let's hurry it up.

Nearl:
That's right.

Nearl:
There's an old saying in Kazimierz: 'Death catches up to you when you stop to take a break.'
