Mephisto:
What's with this woman...

Nearl:
...You there.

Nearl:
The Reunion forces worked like a well-oiled machine when they took over the Chernobog military strongholds.

Nearl:
But your men act like deranged thugs.

Nearl:
Mindless slaughter, burning down the city, hunting down innocents... This was all for your own sadistic pleasure, was it not?

Nearl:
Someone base enough to plot these senseless crimes at a time like this... could not possibly have designed the plan to take down an entire city.

Nearl:
Your commander probably ordered you to cause chaos, but you succumbed to your perversion and tastelessness.

Mephisto:
...

Mephisto:
...Faust.

Mephisto:
I want her shot through the mouth.

Faust:
...

Nearl:
!

Nearl:
*cough* *cough*...

Amiya:
Nearl!

Dobermann:
Their sniper... is ridiculous!

Dobermann:
If Nearl gets hit again, she won't be able to defend herself anymore!

Amiya:
Nearl, you need to retreat!

Nearl:
I can't... He's too powerful. I can't afford to let him hit our squads.

Nearl:
I have to intercept his attacks!

Mephisto:
She managed to block Faust's ballista... with only a shield--?!

Mephisto:
Unbelievable... Impossible!

Mephisto:
Do it again!! Blow her to pieces!

Faust:
--!

Nearl:
What... it's coming from my right? !

Dobermann:
Oh no! Hurry, dodge--

Ace:
As if I'd let you!

Amiya:
Ace!

Ace:
Snipers, take aim!

Ace:
Target the raised platform to the south. Fire!

Faust:
...!

Mephisto:
What?! How dare you... How dare you!

Amiya:
Did we get him?

Ace:
I doubt it. The most we can hope for... is to put some pressure on him.

Ace:
Unfortunately, we don't have the time to dissect our enemies' tactics.

Dobermann:
He's very mobile and has high firepower. The longer this drags on, the less likely we'll be able to block his shots!

Nearl:
We can't give him time to set up...! Amiya, make your move while Team E3's Snipers keep him occupied!

Amiya:
Understood!

Amiya:
Team E1 Snipers, come with me and suppress Reunion's forces!

Amiya:
Team E2, use all the firepower you have to break through their defensive line!

Mephisto:
You filthy vermin...

Mephisto:
Why won't you just obediently roll over and die?

Mephisto:
Why can't I just put an end to you all right here?

Mephisto:
...I want to kill... every... single... one... of you...

Ace:
Nearl, now's your chance! Hurry!

Nearl:
All members of Team E4, we're going to break through their formation!

Nearl:
We're going to clear everything out of our way in one fell swoop!

Nearl:
Let's run wild!!

Reunion Member:
Fire! Fire! Don't let her get any closer...

Reunion Member:
Huh...?

Reunion Member:
What?! She was twenty meters away just a moment ago...

Reunion Member:
Guhh... Aaarrghh!

Nearl:
If you wish to stand against a Kazimierz knight, come back after you've trained a few more decades.

Nearl:
Dobermann! Follow me!

Dobermann:
Understood!
