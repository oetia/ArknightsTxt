Guard:
Ugh... Gahh...

Guard:
Those Reunion goons... sure are energetic!

Ursus Captain:
Who are you people?

Ursus Captain:
Why are you in Chernobog at a time like this?!

Guard:
Huh? Wh-what's going on--

Ursus Captain:
Are you spies?!

Dobermann:
(If our identities get revealed and the Ursus government starts to keep an eye on us, the consequences would be unfathomable!)

Dobermann:
(If it comes down to it...!)

Amiya:
Sir.

Ursus Captain:
... A little girl?

Ursus Captain:
You're... an Infected?

Ursus Captain:
Stop right there! Put down your weapon!

Dobermann:
(Be ready to back her up. If they show any signs of hostility...)

Dobermann:
(Smoke? Where did it come from...?)

Amiya:
Sir, surely you understand that we have a common enemy!

Amiya:
Dobermann!

Dobermann:
Defenders! They're attacking!

Ursus Captain:
Wh-what?!

???:
......

Amiya:
Reunion... they're here.

Dobermann:
Amiya, be careful...

Dobermann:
She's on a completely different level compared to those ordinary thugs!

???:
Hmph. Trying to run...?

???:
Where do you think you're going?

???:
Go. Tear them apart.

Reunion Member:
...

Dobermann:
Even her minions seem like they're well-trained...

Dobermann:
Could she be Reunion's ringleader?

Amiya:
The haze is getting thicker and thicker... are they planning to utilize it to launch a surprise attack?

Amiya:
Sir, we have to evacuate immediately!

Amiya:
If they manage to cut off our escape route, we'll all...

Ursus Captain:
...

Ursus Captain:
Get lost, Infected.

Amiya:
...

Ursus Captain:
I was tasked with defending this street.

Ursus Captain:
Rabbit, I don't care why you came here or what you plan to do.

Ursus Captain:
If you plan to ruin our city, know that someone will come after you. The rage of Ursus is never-ending.

Ursus Captain:
If not, then what happens here is none of your business.

Amiya:
... I understand.

Ursus Captain:
Everybody in Ursus knows to never turn their back to the enemy.

Ursus Captain:
Now scram! We don't have time to deal with you.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Thank you.

Amiya:
Dobermann!

Dobermann:
Hurry! Let's get to the first rendezvous point!

Dobermann:
All teams, move out! Quick!

???:
......

Ursus Captain:
Come at us, Infected filth!

Ursus Captain:
Is that all you're capable of? Are you just going to stand there staring at us?

???:
All Chernobogians...

???:
Must die.
