Amiya:
...

Ch'en:
It's dangerous to lose focus on the battlefield.

Amiya:
I'm sorry...

Amiya:
I just... am having trouble understanding...

Ch'en:
Reunion has bunkered down inside an abandoned mine.

Ch'en:
That woman, W, also fled inside.

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
I can give you some space if you need time alone.

Ch'en:
However, the L.G.D. has no time to waste.

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, gather the others.

Amiya:
(Misha...)

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en--

Amiya:
I have one concern.

Ch'en:
Concern?

Amiya:
W is a master of explosives.

Amiya:
It's highly likely that she has deployed traps on the battlefield.

Amiya:
I'm worried that... we'd sustain heavy casualties from a direct confrontation.

Amiya:
My suggestion is for Rhodes Island to sneak into the mine while your forces set up an encirclement.

Amiya:
We'll flush out the Reunion forces, and you can arrest them immediately...

Amiya:
And those who refuse to surrender, we'll handle our way.

Ch'en:
How confident do you feel about facing that woman?

Amiya:
I'm not sure...

Amiya:
...But we can bear that risk.

Amiya:
We've fought her more than once before. At least we have some understanding of her fighting style.

Amiya:
There are some risks... that the L.G.D. can't afford to shoulder.

Ch'en:
We can't afford to lose sight of the mission objective either.

Amiya:
...

Ch'en:
PC94172, take our forces and surround the mines!

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, pick out a few troops to take with you.

Ch'en:
We'll each take a squad and move in with Rhodes Island.

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, you and Rhodes Island will split off and pincer them. Destroy their base of operations, and rout their defenses.

Ch'en:
I'll take care of the firebases.

Ch'en:
For Lungmen's sake, we have to...

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
...bring Misha back.

Amiya:
...Understood.

Amiya:
I'll gather our operators.

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, there's a small group of Reunion forces heading out along the edge of the mines.

Hoshiguma:
They're moving pretty quickly, too.

Hoshiguma:
I'll head out first, otherwise we might lose them.

Ch'en:
Hurry. Don't let them get away.

Amiya:
Ah, Madam Hoshiguma, please wait a moment.

Amiya:
When they ambushed us earlier, they were hiding some casters among their forces.

Amiya:
I'd recommend taking two of our operators, Franka and Liskarm, with your squad.

Amiya:
They have a lot of experience fighting casters.

Hoshiguma:
No problem.

Franka:
All right, let's do this, shall we?

Liskarm:
What about you, Amiya?

Liskarm:
Dr. Kal'tsit told us to...

Amiya:
Penguin Logistics is backing me up, so I'll be fine.

Hoshiguma:
Sounds like a plan.

Ch'en:
I can't stress this enough, but don't be too stubborn. Back off if the situation gets too rough.

Ch'en:
Amiya?

Amiya:
I know.

Amiya:
We don't have much time left.

Amiya:
This isn't like Chernobog... This time, it's our turn to stop Reunion!
