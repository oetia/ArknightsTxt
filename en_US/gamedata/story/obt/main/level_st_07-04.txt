Kashchey:
I can return her to you, Wei.

Wei Yenwu:
...

Wei Yenwu:
Stop!

Wei Yenwu:
...Don't do it.

Kashchey:
Oh? You and your mighty executioners have made my life hell.

Kashchey:
Of course I'm willing to return her to you... But the cuffs on her body will tear Lungmen in half.

Wei Yenwu:
Damn you...

Kashchey:
Wei, this is the method you used against me. The way you forced me out of Lungmen.

Kashchey:
But now, our roles are reversed. I'm the guest, as well as the poisoner.

Wei Yenwu:
Kashchey. You killed my brother.

Kashchey:
No, no, Wei. You slew your own brother.

Kashchey:
My role is irrelevant. Your brother's tragedy may have come from a Unicorn's secret orders, or from the wrath of a Lung. Whether it was me who leaked the news... ultimately, does not matter.

Kashchey:
What's important, Wei, the one thing you mustn't forget... is that your Chi Xiao drank his blood. You did it.

Kashchey:
Chi Xiao, the dragonslaying sword. And who is it that this blade slew? Your friends. Your family. Your people.

Kashchey:
Dragonslaying sword? How ironic that your people forged a weapon that would be turned against its own kind.

Wei Yenwu:
You've gone too far.

Kashchey:
Very well. I offer you a choice.

Kashchey:
Choose. Slay me, and take back your niece, but lose your city as a result. Or, let us walk free.

Wei Yenwu:
...

Kashchey:
Don't draw that sword. You know the consequences.

Wei Yenwu:
(Grinds teeth audibly)

Kashchey:
Relax, Wei. I've let you choose your own fate. If you don't take my generous offer, then you and I both, all your citizens, and these two lovely sisters... will all perish.

Wei Yenwu:
What are you scheming?

Kashchey:
Wei, old Wei... I know you well. Too well.

Kashchey:
You've always had a choice, isn't that right?

Kashchey:
What will your precious citizens think when they hear that their lives have been placed upon a scale? And on the other side... is a young dragon whose name they've never heard.

Kashchey:
As for me, I don't even have a reason to hurt her.

Wei Yenwu:
...Since I was negligent enough to let you step foot back into this city, there's no reason to let you leave again.

Ch'en:
Tal!

Kashchey:
Oh really?

Wei Yenwu:
......

Wei Yenwu:
I'll kill you myself.

Kashchey:
Now, now. There's no need for that.

Kashchey:
My life is not yours to take.

Kashchey:
By the way, you can save her before I put the handcuffs on her.

Kashchey:
But you'll also have to think about defending against me. Defeating me. Striking me down. Annihilating me... And, what I am going to do next.

Kashchey:
Wei, you're actually afraid of me, aren't you?

Talulah:
She's here.

Talulah:
Finally.

Talulah:
I'll kill her myself.

???:
Confessarius, answer me.

???:
The Leader of Reunion, is there any value in forming an alliance?

Confessarius:
Why ask me about things that you know very well, Your Majesty?

Confessarius:
A youth with no possessions, background, or capital cannot possibly seek to take an important Ursus city alone.

Confessarius:
The uninfected rulers know not what to make of her actions.

Confessarius:
They will panic, overreact, and try to resolve the chaos through more destruction â€” and use the chaos caused by the Infected as a front.

Confessarius:
But, we Sarkaz know better.

Regent:
What do you think of the team she finally left here?

Confessarius:
They are unworthy, Your Majesty. As you foresaw, there is no hope for them. They are not trained soldiers, unable to cause the violence that we seek.

Regent:
Eliminating them will not sever Talulah's power. We lack an opportunity to take her out.

Confessarius:
Right, Your Majesty.

Confessarius:
The situation that she fomented and the power she wielded to force the issue... shows that she is no one-eyed leader among the blind, or some pampered princeling awaiting the throne.

Confessarius:
She is a conspirator.

Regent:
Even if that is the case, I require a comprehensive response from the Sarkaz.

Confessarius:
In that case, I have two bits of good news. First, we already have a lead on our search for the Lord of Fiends.

Confessarius:
Rhodes Island hasn't yet been manipulated by foreign forces.

Regent:
Don't waste time. We need her to begin right now.

Confessarius:
Please do not be angered, and hear me out.

Confessarius:
'She' is ready.

Regent:
That power is rightfully ours.

Regent:
The true King of Sarkaz is mightier than the heir of any unknown name.
