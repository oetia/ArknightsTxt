Texas:
...

Texas:
Rhodes Island sure is taking their time.

Texas:
Oh...?

Reunion Member:
We're almost at the interception point!

Texas:
Tch, finally... I just finished unpacking.

Texas:
What a waste.

Reunion Member:
Hurry up! Those in the back, follow more closely!

Texas:
Hey, masked person over there.

Reunion Member:
Who is it? !

Reunion Member:
What do you want?

Texas:
All of you, come at me. I'm short on time.

Franka:
Amiya, Texas from Penguin Logistics has returned.

Amiya:
Ahh... what a relief!

Texas:
I have an update here.

Texas:
I just took care of some guys who called themselves 'Reunion.'

Texas:
... But there are a lot more of them coming.

Texas:
Reunion has come out of hiding and are starting to move in groups.

Amiya:
It's as I feared...

Amiya:
Reunion has already infiltrated Lungmen through the slums...

Amiya:
And their target... is the same as ours.

Amiya:
Otherwise, there would be no reason for them to come after Rhodes Island.

Liskarm:
Miss Misha is carrying secrets that only Lungmen and Reunion know.

Liskarm:
We're caught in a disadvantageous situation.

Franka:
Things aren't looking good for us right now.

Franka:
I'll really have to poke that officer's pretty little face later to find out what's actually going on.

Texas:
...Anything else to add?

Texas:
If not, I'll lead the way. I know exactly where to go!

Texas:
Exusiai has confirmed our escape route. I'll now take you through it.

Amiya:
Franka, gather all the squads. We--

Franka:
We... should find cover first.

Franka:
Reunion is already here.

Reunion Member:
Over here! Don't let them get away!

Franka:
There's nothing more annoying than when trouble keeps nipping at your tail.

Amiya:
...Something's wrong.

Amiya:
No...!

Amiya:
They... have a leader!

Franka:
Ugh...

Amiya:
Watch out!

Reunion Member:
Skullshatterer, they're right here. Yes, that's her!

Reunion Member:
Casters, go! Tear them to shreds!

Liskarm:
They mean business...

Liskarm:
Watch out! The enemy has deployed multiple casters! Prepare appropriate countermeasures!

Amiya:
What they're after is...

Amiya:
...Misha!

Misha:
Aah... Who... are you...

Skullshatterer:
...

Skullshatterer:
Finally...

Skullshatterer:
I...

Misha:
...

Skullshatterer:
I've finally... found you.

Misha:
Who are you...?!
