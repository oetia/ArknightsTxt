Ch'en:
Hoshiguma?

Hoshiguma:
Huh?

Ch'en:
You don't look so good.

Hoshiguma:
I'm fine, I was just thinking.

Ch'en:
...I didn't think he'd get dragged into this.

Hoshiguma:
Don't worry, you know how I am. It's all in the past now, or as we say in Lungmen, such is fate.

Ch'en:
Do people in the Far East believe in fate?

Hoshiguma:
Having been through so many things, even if I didn't believe it before, I have to accept it now.

Hoshiguma:
Is the intel accurate?

Ch'en:
Without a doubt. Here's the location indicated by the intel.

Hoshiguma:
Those Reunion members skulking around... are they our targets?

Hoshiguma:
By the looks of things, they don't know that we've completely surrounded them yet.

Hoshiguma:
They seem to be building something around the entire block.

Ch'en:
If I'm not mistaken, this is one of the central hubs that connects Reunion's various bases.

Ch'en:
If we destroy the communication facility here, we can deliver a crippling blow to their forces in this area.

Ch'en:
That would put us one step closer to recapturing the L.G.D. Headquarters.

Hoshiguma:
Your call.

Ch'en:
Also, I can't stop thinking about the details of the intel report.

Hoshiguma:
You mean, that part about Reunion's objective not just being the construction of a forward base?

Ch'en:
That's right.

Ch'en:
'Enemies are secretly looking for an extremely high-value target. It is necessary to determine their actions first.'

Hoshiguma:
What are they doing in the wealthy districts? What kind of high-value target are they trying to find there?

Ch'en:
It seems a bit fishy to me as well. According to our previous plans, all the buildings here should already have been evacuated.

Ch'en:
If Reunion is planning to kidnap one of the moguls, they probably won't find them here.

Hoshiguma:
When are we going to make our move? Scouting doesn't seem to be Reunion's strong suit, so we can carry out our raid at any time.

Ch'en:
They're probably used to always being the hunters, not the prey.

Hoshiguma:
Now that it's their turn to be the prey, they'll be hunted down in no time.

Hoshiguma:
Let's continue observing them carefully for now. Our priority is to find out what their objectives are, not to engage them.

Ch'en:
It's easy enough to go in and destroy them, but it'll take patience to find out what they're after.

Hoshiguma:
Understood.

Hoshiguma:
Wait! Ch'en, are they about to break the door of that house down?

Ch'en:
Has the target already been confirmed? Assemble, quickly!

Hoshiguma:
To minimize the loss of civilians, huh?

Ch'en:
Of course! Snipers, take aim!

L.G.D. Agent:
Understood.

Reunion Member:
...!

Reunion Member:
It's Lungmen's army! Fall back!

Reunion Member:
We need to contact...

Ch'en:
Snipers! Shoot down that person with the radio equipment! Stop that transmission!

Hoshiguma:
They're supposed to be defending the base, so how come they're running away from us? They're up to something!

Ch'en:
Let's see how far you can run!
