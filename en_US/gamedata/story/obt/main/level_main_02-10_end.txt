Skullshatterer:
Nngh...

Amiya:
Ugh... Gahh...

Reunion Member:
Aaah-!

Reunion Member:
Skullshatterer, are you okay?!

Skullshatterer:
Tch... What a troublesome bunch!

Reunion Member:
Skullshatterer, W just said that she's all finished on her end!

Reunion Member:
She's successfully retrieved the target.

Skullshatterer:
W... she won?

Reunion Member:
That's right, her assault went very smoothly!

Reunion Member:
Should we also retreat?

Skullshatterer:
...

Skullshatterer:
Send a signal to Talulah.

Reunion Member:
Roger!

Skullshatterer:
...We're pulling back.

Skullshatterer:
Hmph. Rhodes Island cowards...

Skullshatterer:
The next time we meet... will be at your execution.

Amiya:
Reunion... is retreating?

Franka:
They're retreating very rapidly. Something must have changed with their plans.

Franka:
Despite all that talk, they sure know how to run away.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Something... doesn't feel right.

Liskarm:
Are you saying...

Amiya:
...!

Amiya:
That they were only here to stall us...?

Amiya:
If that's the case...

Amiya:
Oh no, the L.G.D. is in trouble!

Amiya:
...We have to help Madam Ch'en right now!

Amiya:
Franka, call the recon squad back immediately!

Amiya:
Liskarm, try to get in touch with Madam Ch'en!

Ch'en:
Where's the Special Operations Division? Their reinforcements are supposed to be here by now!

L.G.D. Agent:
We were just notified that they've been stalled by Reunion...!

Ch'en:
How's that possible? Reunion is nothing more than a gang of unruly thugs!

L.G.D. Agent:
...And they were only facing... a single enemy...

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
Unless...
