Chernobog - Operation Squad E0's Location

Dr. {@nickname} Rescue Operation - Final Retreat Phase

Dobermann:
Damn it!

Dobermann:
Even though we've already made it to the exit...!

???:
Did you really think we'd let you just stroll out of Chernobog?

???:
Don't you think it's about time for someone to wake you from your daydream?

Dobermann:
Our commmunications have been restored, and I've contact O.P.D. They'll be joining up with us shortly!

Dobermann:
But, this blasted...

Nearl:
Watch out, she's holding onto explosives!

Dobermann:
I still can't get in touch with the recon team!

Amiya:
... Who exactly are you?

???:
I don't expect you to know who I am...

???:
But, I know that person next to you.

Amiya:
Is Reunion... going to continue fighting us?

???:
Hey, hey, don't be like that.

???:
I have no love for that she-dragon, Talulah. I'm not even cut out for this goaltending business. It's a pain to have to rush over here after a long day of work.

???:
So for the sake of future cooperation, why don't we exchange some pleasantries first?

???:
You may simply call me... W.

W:
I've waited a long time to see that person next to you.

Amiya:
...Doctor?

W:
Dr.{@Nickname}......

W:
I have a few little questions I'd like to ask {@Nickname}. Would you be so kind as to give us some... alone time?

Nearl:
You're wasting your breath.

W:
--Don't be so hasty. I have some information you might be interested in.

W:
Actually, we just met some rather slick fellows... Quite skilled, and dressed just like you guys.

W:
Though their camouflage might have been enough to fool Ursus, I saw right through their little trick~

Amiya:
Could they be from the recon team?

Amiya:
I'm glad... that they're safe...

W:
Little bunny, are you their leader?

Amiya:
? !

W:
I'm quite curious, what charm do you hold over them... so that they'd give their lives so enthusiastically and unremorsefully for you?

Amiya:
What... are you saying...?

W:
You heard me. None of them... will be returning to you.

W:
Hey, you...

W:
Are you really... worth sacrificing their lives over?

Amiya:
...

W:
I'm not done talking yet.

W:
Amiya...

W:
... Did I make you mad?

Amiya:
... You've gone too far.

W:
Good, good... Now that's more like it.

W:
Come at me.

Amiya:
W of the Reunion Movement, you've gone too far!

Amiya:
Every life is precious, each and every one...

Amiya:
This is something that you'll never tarnish!

Amiya:
Doctor!!

W:
Heheh...
