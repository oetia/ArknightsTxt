FrostNova:
It... shattered?

FrostNova:
The old man got this from some wizard.... Said it would keep me alive.

FrostNova:
Didn't even make it through one fight, huh. I guess it was fake.

FrostNova:
Just like I'm his fake daughter, maybe...? And now, like Reunion.... As well.

Blaze:
Mmm!

Blaze:
Uh....

Amiya:
*Cough* *cough*.... Blaze!

Blaze:
The cold's..... gone.

Blaze:
I'm fine! Amiya, hurry, go check on the white rabbit!

FrostNova:
Nice win, Rhodes Island.

FrostNova:
My brothers and sisters.... I let them die in vain.

FrostNova:
We accomplished nothing.

FrostNova:
My life.... wasn't worth anything at all.

Blaze:
........

FrostNova:
My death.... isn't worth anyone's time.

FrostNova:
Go save who you can. Hurry.

FrostNova:
Go.

FrostNova:
Whether it's stopping the raincoats, going to kill Mephisto, or sheltering the Infected who have nowhere else to go....

FrostNova:
Go. Go do something worthwhile.

Amiya:
........

Amiya:
Doctor...

Amiya:
Okay.

Amiya:
Doctor, please tell her.

Amiya:
Please.

FrostNova:
What a.... naive rabbit.

FrostNova:
Just like Talulah back then. Very similar.

FrostNova:
To be able to see someone like this before I die, someone so determined to realize their ideals....

FrostNova:
I guess that's been swirling around in your head, huh?

FrostNova:
Villains are what villains are. I have no complaints about the ending I deserve.

FrostNova:
I have hurt you. Reunion, and I, targeted innocent Lungmenites and single-handedly led the Ursus Infected into this nightmare. Such people have no business at Rhodes Island.

FrostNova:
My brothers and sisters.... Those fools must have tried to keep me alive, huh?

FrostNova:
I thought that even if I died here, those idiots would get a place where they could live in peace.

FrostNova:
Wrong and wrong. They died. To protect me, a woman who didn't have much time left to begin with.

FrostNova:
I'm not happy. We were used and abused. Our lives thrown away.

FrostNova:
I'm not happy.... This last moment of life, this does not belong to me. They bought this with their blood!

FrostNova:
This little bit of life..... I must give it to someone trustworthy.

FrostNova:
Thank you.

FrostNova:
...Ah... Even if we survived, where is there to go?

FrostNova:
We had nowhere. The only thing we were ever knew was the snow.

FrostNova:
Lungmen is not Ursus. We came, desperate to save our people, and the Infected, looking for a warm place, with food, and shelter....

FrostNova:
That's not Lungmen. From the beginning, it should not have been Lungmen. The people of Lungmen are also struggling to eke out a living.

FrostNova:
We should have gone back to Ursus.... Our homeland.....

FrostNova:
Snow.... a peaceful river.... the pine forests gently swaying.... the turquoise moss....

FrostNova:
This world, it's beautiful....

FrostNova:
...If I'm right... The plot is ready to unfurl.

FrostNova:
Even if old man Buldrokkas'tee could stall it for a while, Talulah would have a way to deal with him.

FrostNova:
Lungmen can't do anything.... And all Ursus can do is watch.

FrostNova:
But you're still here, and the Infected still have a chance. Even if only a small one...

FrostNova:
——go put an end to Talulah. Stop her madness and don't let Reunion swallow up any more Infected. Reunion doesn't need Talulah, any Talulah....

FrostNova:
Or.....

FrostNova:
I could make a selfish request. Go save her. No. Go help her. Along with our countless fellow Infected....

FrostNova:
The real one.... Walking on muddy earth.... Talulah....

FrostNova:
Go... ahead.

FrostNova:
........

FrostNova:
How could I not know? It's just, he's going to outlive me.

FrostNova:
How much better it would have been if he had never adopted me. That way, he wouldn't have to feel all the pain I've brought him.

FrostNova:
He's suffered so much....

FrostNova:
Hehehe....

FrostNova:
...Doctor.

FrostNova:
I can call you that, can't I?

FrostNova:
Doctor of Rhodes Island, choices just might be meaningless, in this world.

FrostNova:
Even so, even if the outcome makes no difference.... I do want to choose for myself. I made my choice.

FrostNova:
With my own hands.... To take the fruit of the seeds I have sown.

FrostNova's fingers grope at your face .

FrostNova:
Strange. Your face... is cold.

FrostNova:
My body temperature.... Is not so low anymore?

FrostNova:
I can finally touch someone... before I die.

FrostNova:
Do I really deserve that?

FrostNova:
...It would be rude not to give a response.

FrostNova:
Tell Amiya, Dr. {@nickname}....

FrostNova:
In this world, a single person is worthless.

FrostNova:
But she's absolutely not alone.

FrostNova:
From now on, I am at your side. Both of you.

FrostNova:
I......  would like to join Rhodes Island.

FrostNova:
No... thank you.

FrostNova:
Your eyes.... remind me of someone I used to know.

FrostNova:
I met a boy who said his brother would rather go to the gallows than beg for his enemies' mercy....

FrostNova:
So he was going to walk across the snowy plains, he was going to walk all of Ursus.... And he didn't come with us.

FrostNova:
I thought he was the most idealistic person I'd ever met.

FrostNova:
But now, you and Amiya changed my mind... Maybe ideals can be a kind of faith.

FrostNova:
The original Reunion.... was the same.

FrostNova:
Just the same.

FrostNova:
Your eyes, and that boy's, really do look the same.

FrostNova:
Only, you're not as determined as he was. You're so much.... So much gentler.

FrostNova:
Let me go. My brothers and sisters are waiting for me.

FrostNova:
......Father...... I've been such a fool.

FrostNova:
Forgive me.

She slips down.

The corners of her mouth turn up, haughty as she was when she lived.
