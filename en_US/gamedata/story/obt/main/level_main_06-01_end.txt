Blaze:
Hah...

Blaze:
Luckily I did some warm up back in Chernobog. But really, I didn't even break a sweat handling you guys.

Reunion Member:
You! You Rhodes Islander, you're a disgrace to all Infected. How could you turn on your own like this just to help Lungmen?!

Reunion Member:
So you'll hand us over to them, as if that keeps your hands clean? Bullshit! How do you live with yourself?!

Blaze:
Huh?

Blaze:
You ate two punches, cracked your skull on the pavement and you've still got the energy to talk trash? Not bad.

Blaze:
But you've got it all wrong.

Reunion Member:
Mmf!

Blaze:
Having trouble breathing? Feel like your lungs are on fire?

Reunion Member:
Ack... Guh...

Blaze:
It starts in your sinuses, then crawls down your windpipe, until it finally finds a home there in your diaphragm. All I have to do is wiggle my little finger and...

Blaze:
A stream of superheated air will shoot into your body, expand, ignite your organs, and erupt out of your pores.

Blaze:
The funny thing is, Lungmen might let you live. But me and my little finger...?

Reunion Member:
Aah! Gaaah...!

Blaze:
Won't leave any of you breathing.

Reunion Member:
Nooooo! L-let me go! Please!!!

Blaze:
Fine. I'll be merciful.

Blaze:
Officer! Over here. You take care of them.

Blaze:
And one more thing, my new Ursus buddy. You think next time you could actually make me break a sweat?

Blaze:
Hey, they made it.

Blaze:
Dr. {@nickname}, over here!

Blaze:
Hah. That was nothing.

Blaze:
How about next time I show you how to snap an arm 90 degrees without breaking the bone?

Blaze:
Hey, what's with that face...?

Blaze:
How long have you been at Rhodes Island? You're acting like you've never seen a fight before.

Blaze:
Compared to them, I'm a regular softie.

Blaze:
But of course. You think I'm the type to play it low-key?

Blaze:
If I can put the fear of Blaze into them, who knows how many others might just give up.

Blaze:
I have to play it up to make all my hard work worth something.

Amiya:
Let's not steer the Doctor astray...

Blaze:
Bunny!

Amiya:
Don't just scoop me up like a toy!

Blaze:
But you're just so soft...! Hey! Stop struggling! Just let it happen. I promise I won't bite!

Amiya:
Blaze... Stop... Can't... Breathe!

Blaze:
Phew.

Amiya:
We've only been apart for an hour! What's with you! Get serious!

Blaze:
I take it back. You're not cute.

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
That's enough...!

Blaze:
Woah, hey, I was just playing! Get out of my head! I can't take you screwing around with my emotions again!

Blaze:
Wait.

Blaze:
She's here with you?

GreyThroat:
Hello, I'm...

Blaze:
I know who you are.

Blaze:
Talk to my fellow Infected like that again and I'll tear out your throat myself.

Amiya:
Blaze!

Blaze:
Sorry, Amiya.

Blaze:
But that's the way it is. And she deserves a warning.

GreyThroat:
......

Blaze:
I'm out. Rendezvous at the next waypoint.

Amiya:
GreyThroat, Blaze may have misunderstood you.

GreyThroat:
It's fine. I really did say those things.

Amiya:
She shouldn't be dredging up your past to attack the person you are today.

GreyThroat:
Who knows? Have I really changed? Even I don't know.

Amiya:
......

GreyThroat:
I'm here because I wanted to do something. No matter what that Blaze says.

Amiya:
Sigh...

Amiya:
(Right... She's not Infected, so GreyThroat might not grasp the reality of Rhodes Island's current situation.)

Amiya:
(This operation could force her to decide once and for all... if she's going to stay or leave.)

Amiya:
(But she's gotten used to taking orders, and doesn't speak up much. Sometimes she does surprise, though...)

Amiya:
(There's no malice in her heart. She just needs a chance to find herself.)

Amiya:
(Still, she's strong and reliable. You can trust her, Doctor. And even if we can't help her, I know she can help you.)

Amiya:
Oh... where did Gavial go?

Amiya:
She can't do that!

Amiya:
Wait a minute, who taught you to think of her like that, Doctor? I mean, it's kind of true, but still...

Amiya:
We can't afford to make mistakes here. Hurry to the next waypoint and try to signal her.

Amiya:
Even if she's operating according to plan, there'll be trouble if no one's watching her...

Amiya:
We've got elite operators acting as squad leaders. They'll report in. Don't worry.

Amiya:
We stand at a crucial point in this joint operation. This is the decisive battle for Lungmen.

Amiya:
She has her own mission to command.

Amiya:
Superintendent Ch'en, as Chief of the Special Inspection Unit, will be deploying the best the L. G. D. has to offer against Reunion in service of our joint plan.

Amiya:
At the same time, she has to herd Reunion's main force to the target location, all while keeping any of their smaller teams from slipping into the slums.

Amiya:
And we, Rhodes Island, will keep moving through the waypoints on our patrol route, mopping up Reunion's squads along the way, pushing them to give up the fight.

Amiya:
Finally, we'll reach the target location at the slums and, together with the L. G. D., we'll deliver the decisive blow to Reunion's main force.

Amiya:
Considering the scale, there's relatively little Rhodes Island can do. But we'll execute the plan to the best of our abilities.

Amiya:
As for the issues that have come up in the course of our cooperation with the L. G. D.... Dr. {@nickname}, I promise to answer all our people.

Amiya:
But, Doctor, there is something only you can do.

Amiya:
Heh, good.

Amiya:
But it's not the kind of thing you'll have to put so much effort into.

Amiya:
Now's not the time to clam up!

Amiya:
Are you waiting for me to say more?

Amiya:
You could at least tell me what you're thinking, Doctor...!

Amiya:
No, that's okay!

Amiya:
This isn't the kind of thing you need to be so solemn about.

Amiya:
I'm going to call up Blaze and have her look after you. And for the little while until we meet up again, I need you to look after her too.

Amiya:
Ugh... I'm not talking about like in battle! I mean look after her psychology.

Amiya:
You know Rhodes Island has to fight the Infected sometimes.

Amiya:
Especially right now. Our cooperation with Lungmen has led to some friction.

Amiya:
Blaze is one of the elite operators we rely on for survival, yes, but her psychological state has an impact on her performance.

Amiya:
It is because she is so resolutely committed to our mission that her encounters with the Infected have the potential to influence her emotions.

Amiya:
Go on, Doctor. Treat it as an opportunity to learn what makes her tick.

Amiya:
Show your appreciation for her. Thank her for saving you back there. She'll eat it up!

Amiya:
I believe in you, Doctor! Go get 'em!

Swire:
Their main force is engaging our other teams!

Swire:
We will reach the target location ahead of Reunion and join the formation!

Ch'en:
Tell them we need to eliminate all Reunion elements that have not joined up with their main force first.

Swire:
Right. Got it!

Swire:
Do what Superintendent Ch'en just said! Over and out!

Swire:
How long has it been since we fought together like this?

Ch'en:
I wouldn't say we're 'fighting together' now. It's more like we're 'co-belligerents.' How did you get back here anyway?

Swire:
I've got my own motor pool, of course. How else do you think I saved Rhodes Island? Now what's got your panties in a twist? I can tell you're upset.

Ch'en:
Hm. Let me think.

Swire:
You need to think about it! Look at you looking for reasons to be mad...

Ch'en:
Oh, right. You went behind my back to save Rhodes Island. You could have told me in private.

Swire:
Was that embarrassing for you? Or you just don't like being kept in the dark?

Ch'en:
Both.

Swire:
Wowee... since when are you so direct? My old Officer Ch'en would talk herself in circles for hours...

Ch'en:
Eyes forward!

Swire:
L. G. D. defender squad, shields up! Play it just like we have a million times before. And never forget, your brothers and sisters are right behind you! Stand firm!

Ch'en:
Hold!

Swire:
Crossbows, nock!

Reunion Member:
They blocked this road too? Uh oh... there's nowhere to go! We're trapped!

Reunion Member:
Relax, we can break them! With me!

Ch'en:
Hold!

Swire:
Guards, ready!

Reunion Member:
Overrun them!

Ch'en:
——Now!

Swire:
Crossbows, first volley, fire!

Ch'en:
Pikes up!

Ch'en:
Don't let a single one of them out of our city!

Wei Yenwu:
Are you on site?

Wei Yenwu:
Yes, that's right.

Wei Yenwu:
I know. But the L. G. D. has their job to do and you have yours. Don't forget your role in all this.

Wei Yenwu:
Indeed. Lin Kojui is quite opposed.

Wei Yenwu:
But this matter is beyond him!

Wei Yenwu:
......

Wei Yenwu:
I've heard all the opinions from all the stakeholders. But there is no wiggle room here. I do what must be done.

Wei Yenwu:
Kojui's daughter will reach out to you. In the next three weeks, you are not to contact me. Everything goes to her.

Wei Yenwu:
I leave it to you. Don't worry. I am watching you.

Wei Yenwu:
...There's no need for that. The past is the past. And it stays in the past.

Wei Yenwu:
Right. To the peaceful and stable future of Lungmen.

???:
Wei, old boy, we're brothers, of a sort, aren't we...?

???:
So I'm asking you, for the sake of my daughter and her mother...

???:
Honestly, should I even have to ask? Would you really refuse to help your own sister?

???:
I've already decided on a name for my daughter. We'll call her...

???:
...Talulah.

???:
Don't take it to heart. I understand.

???:
It's all very clear to me.
