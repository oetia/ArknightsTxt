???:
We'll be friends from now on. Those adults won't be able to bully us anymore!

???:
Don't be afraid. From now on, I'll help you no matter what happens.

???:
If something bad happens to me, you'd better help me too! That's what friends are for!

???:
Hehe, we'll always be together, right?

???:
Do you still remember what you did when that old duke snatched her away?

???:
Can you really do whatever it takes for the sake of Lungmen?

???:
Now, Wei Yenwu, what - or who - are you going to sacrifice this time?

Ch'en:
Nngh... Ugh...

???:
Hey, wake up!

Ch'en:
Save her...

???:
Officer Ch'en, wake up!

Ch'en:
...Let me through! Let me...

???:
Puk gaai, I don't have time to deal with this right now!

*splash*—

Ch'en:
Hnnf!

Ch'en:
*cough* *cough*...

???:
Finally awake?

Ch'en:
Ack...

Ch'en:
What...

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, hurry! Reunion—

Ch'en:
...

???:
Are you done daydreaming? Good grief, you're a mess.

Ch'en:
Why are you here? Where's my squad?

???:
What if I told you that they were all killed in action?

Ch'en:
If you're itching for a beating, then you'd better queue up behind Reunion.

???:
I see your tongue is as sharp as ever. How come your performance in battle doesn't follow suit?

Hoshiguma:
What's going on over here? I leave for a moment, and you two are already at each others' throats?

Hoshiguma:
Miss Swire, would it kill you to be a little less sarcastic towards her?

Swire:
Hmph.

Hoshiguma:
You too, Ch'en, you only just woke up...

Hoshiguma:
Wait, why do you look like you just got into a fight with a watering cart?

Ch'en:
Ask her.

Hoshiguma:
Young lady, what's this empty glass doing here? I remember pouring a glass of water for each of you.

Swire:
She was spouting nonsense in her sleep.

Hoshiguma:
Good grief...

Ch'en:
Where are we?

Hoshiguma:
In a cabin in Rhodes Island.

Swire:
Officer Ch'en, you and your team retreated to Lungmen about 45 minutes ago.

Swire:
You might've thought that you hid your tracks well, but Reunion did not think that was the case.
