Liskarm:
Why are there so many Reunion members here?!

Reunion Member:
Aaargh!

Franka:
...

Franka:
Am I the only one who thinks that there are more and more of them coming?

Reunion Member:
Ugh!!

Liskarm:
Nope. It's clear that they have more reinforcements coming.

Amiya:
Curses... We still haven't had a chance to avenge them yet...!

Liskarm:
They ended up finding us first.

Liskarm:
Franka, look.

Liskarm:
Over by the east exit, I think those are Reunion's casters hiding over there.

Franka:
A lot of them approaching from the central passage as well as from the high-rises to our sides...

Franka:
...They're trying to sneak over while pretending like they haven't noticed us yet.

Franka:
But, we're on top of the roof...

Franka:
No matter how many they send at us, they'll be doomed if they get knocked over...

Franka:
I feel like they're insulting my intelligence by launching an attack as brazen as this...

Amiya:
Is Reunion launching their offensive?

Amiya:
All operators, regroup!

Franka:
Wait, I think I just saw...

Franka:
Isn't that the Reunion commander we ran into earlier?

Skullshatterer:
...

Skullshatterer:
... Rhodes Island.

Skullshatterer:
Did you turn her over to Lungmen?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
(Franka, we have to hold back the Reunion forces first!)

Amiya:
(We'll have to make our way down once they're too afraid to keep attacking us!)

Amiya:
(We'll have to spread out the battlefield for now!)

Franka:
(Understood. We'll be doing a hit and run then!)

Amiya:
What does it have to do with you?

Skullshatterer:
...How dare you!

Skullshatterer:
...

Skullshatterer:
My comrades, attaaack!
