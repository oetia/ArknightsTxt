Jessica:
Th-there are two enemies left!

Jessica:
They're running toward the building to our east--

Meteorite:
I've already locked on to them.

Meteorite:
...!

Reunion Member:
Argh...!

Meteorite:
Bullseye.

Frostleaf:
Aren't we making too much noise?

Meteorite:
There are a ton of explosions all over the city. I don't think they'll notice.

Meteorite:
Have you notified Dr. Kal'tsit yet?

Frostleaf:
I called her before the battle started.

Frostleaf:
There's evidence that Reunion is conducting their operations in this city.

Frostleaf:
I haven't hung up yet.

Frostleaf:
Shouldn't we be a bit stealthier with our movements?

Meteorite:
That Reunion member just now seemed to be using Detection-type Arts.

Meteorite:
We'll have to strike first so that we don't give away our location.

Meteorite:
At least, we can't give these Reunion squads time to communicate with each other.

Jessica:
Phew... It's finally over...

Meteorite:
Frostleaf, assess the situation.

Frostleaf:
Understood.

Frostleaf:
Here, hold on to the comms device.

Meteorite:
Sure.

Meteorite:
Jessica, don't let your guard down yet.

Jessica:
Of course... I'm aware of that!

Meteorite:
All right, all right. I won't mention it again.

Meteorite:
Dr. Kal'tsit, can you hear me?

Kal'tsit:
Always could. Indeed, you can't afford to let your guard down yet.

Kal'tsit:
Jessica, there might be an enemy behind you.

Jessica:
Uwaaah!

Reunion Member:
H-how did they... get behind me...

Jessica:
...Eeehh??

Frostleaf:
If I can attack you from behind, that means you were too slow.

Frostleaf:
We're fine for now, Dr. Kal'tsit. I've taken out the enemy.

Meteorite:
You really are fast...

Meteorite:
I couldn't even see how you managed to get over there and come back so quickly.

Frostleaf:
--Actually, I never even left.

Meteorite:
...

Kal'tsit:
Projekt Red contacted me.

Kal'tsit:
There are no signs of activity from the Reunion forces hiding in Lungmen.

Kal'tsit:
At this stage, it'd be best not to poke the hornet's nest.

Kal'tsit:
By the way, according to the intel I've received from the other recon teams, there may a fairly substantial Reunion presence in the desert.

Meteorite:
In other words, we're the ones who hit the jackpot?

Meteorite:
That does put a bit of pressure on us. We're also only a recon team after all.

Jessica:
If that's the case, we've already eliminated two Reunion squads so far...

Meteorite:
Are you absolutely sure about the affiliation of the enemies we first exchanged fire with, Jessica?

Jessica:
Yeah, there shouldn't be any mistake. I double checked before asking you to shoot.

Meteorite:
...My bad. I was busy calculating the ballistic trajectory.

Kal'tsit:
What about the enemy's numbers?

Meteorite:
We don't know the exact number.

Meteorite:
Frostleaf, how's it going over there?

Frostleaf:
...

Meteorite:
What's the matter...?

Kal'tsit:
Go take care of it. Let me know right away if there's an issue.

Jessica:
Will do.

Jessica:
Let's... head over to her to see what's going on.

Meteorite:
...

Meteorite:
What happened?

Frostleaf:
...You two didn't feel it?

Jessica:
Huh? What...

Frostleaf:
The temperature.

Jessica:
Now that you mentioned it... it does seem colder...

Frostleaf:
The temperature.

Meteorite:
...Indeed. There's at least a five-degree difference compared to the temperature outside.

Jessica:
How could such fair weather... change so suddenly...

Frostleaf:
Look above you. The weather hasn't changed.

Jessica:
...Huh?

Frostleaf:
It's not the weather.

Frostleaf:
It's coming from here. Come, feel this.

Meteorite:
...The walls of the ruins?

Frostleaf:
That's right. These walls are heat-absorbing.

Jessica:
...No way?!

Frostleaf:
Before we came, the heat absorption had probably already worn off.

Frostleaf:
It's returning to the previous temperature.

Frostleaf:
But, why?

Frostleaf:
Who would leave behind something like this?

Meteorite:
...Reunion are the only ones who've been active in these parts.

Jessica:
Reunion? Could they... do something like this?

Frostleaf:
The Infected...

Frostleaf:
I once heard of a certain legend.

Frostleaf:
...about a creature called the 'yeti.'

Meteorite:
...I have a feeling... that this is going to get real troublesome...
