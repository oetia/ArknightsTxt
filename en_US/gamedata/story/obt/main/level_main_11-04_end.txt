Rhodes Island Operator:
We have a signal, Amiya!

Amiya:
Good.

Amiya:
Casters! Hold the shield with me!

Amiya:
Everyone else, get to the corner!

The Sarkaz casters raise their staves together.

Monsters made of blood rush up from underground. The entire street opens its gaping maw beneath the soldiers.

Amiya:
Nngh—!

Amiya:
There's too many of them!

Black lines cut through the flesh of the monsters, but even more rise again from the fallen, gnawing away at the Arts forming a defensive barrier.

The fighters run for their lives, but the stench from the predators' jaws is never far behind.

Finally, they make it into another alley, and find themselves face-to-face with an aura that is potent, pure and fearsome.

???:
Stop.

The bloody tide stops in its tracks.

It was as though they ran into an invisible wall when they rounded the corner. The maggot-shaped Arts creations smash themselves into pieces, leaving bloody trails on the ground.

The empty street is completely silent.

Amiya:
Casualties?

Rhodes Island Operator:
We're fine. We got out quick enough.

Rhodes Island Operator:
I hope we've delayed the Sarkaz, made things safer for Allerdale and Siege...

Amiya:
Thanks, everyone, especially our Self-Salvation Corps friends. Thank you for being willing to take this risk with us.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Commander Clovisia calls Rhodes Island our most important ally. We're always ready to do what we have to.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Plus, if this Rhodes Island operator here hadn't helped us, that Vampire would've done all of us in a long time ago.

???:
No need to thank me.

???:
I've seen too much meaningless killing in Londinium. I must stop my compatriots who have gone too far.

Feist:
Sorry, Doctor...

Feist:
I had, er, a little fight with Granny when I skipped out of the factory last year.

A dozen big, bruising workers surround you.

Their eyes are filled with suspicion.

You glance at the drills and spanners in their hands, then at Feist, dressed like the workers, but here on his own.

Feist:
I guess Granny is still sore at me...

Catherine:
I've got no reason to be sore at a dead man. I didn't even know my only grandson was still alive, 'til a minute ago.

Feist:
I wanted to send a message, but it was too risky. The Sarkaz monitor all communications into Highbury.

Feist:
I can't let the Sarkaz tie you to the Self-Salvation Corps.

Catherine:
So you joined that band of crackpots.

Feist:
...The Londinium Citizens' Self-Salvation Corps.

Feist:
We did a lot in Sudean, Granny. The Sarkaz control the media, and they call us an 'unnamed violent gang'...

Catherine:
You're the ones who blew up the wall.

Feist:
Er... it was the Do...

Feist:
Right... it was mostly the Sarkaz who did it.

Feist:
Thanks, Doctor.

Feist:
I didn't know you had such high regard for my rope work.

Catherine:
So you're here to blow up the armory?

Feist:
Of course not!

Catherine:
What did you say to your Self-Salvation Corps friends? We're making weapons for the Sarkaz, to use against Victorians?

Feist:
No, Granny. What I told them was...

Feist:
My granny stands up to protect their livelihoods.

Catherine:
......

Feist:
I know you think I'm a brat with little more than a couple of silly tricks.

Feist:
But I didn't come back to drag the workers into this. And I'm not here to try to convince you, either.

Feist:
I have my goals, of course, and it'd be brilliant if you were able to help me. But first—

Feist:
I just wanted to see that you're safe.

Catherine:
Come here, and let me have a look at you.

Feist:
Granny...

Catherine:
You've put on a few inches, brat.

Feist:
Yeah, I grew a little bit.

Londinium Merchant:
I'll have the goods soon.

Londinium Merchant:
A suit of steam armor... how many men would kill to get one like it?

Londinium Merchant:
The nobles of Leithanien love to flaunt such storied antiques.

Londinium Merchant:
Oh, and do be sure to ask those Columbian firms as well. They might be interested, even if the tech is centuries old.

Londinium Merchant:
Getting it out will be no trouble at all. What business do you think I'm running in Londinium these days?

Londinium Merchant:
The Sarkaz are a gang of raving psychopaths, and they alone can't rule Londinium.

Londinium Merchant:
I have friends in the Defense Forces. They'll take care of it for me.

Londinium Merchant:
I've heard it has a few external blemishes, however. I do hope that won't hurt the price?

???:
Why not cancel the deal, if you're so worried about the price?

Londinium Merchant:
Who's there?!

Siege:
Don't worry, we just happened to be traveling the same way.

Londinium Merchant:
Get this intruder out of here!

Londinium Merchant:
Say... where are my bodyguards?

Siege:
I've asked them to take a short nap. You can go and wake them once we've finished our chat.

Londinium Merchant:
All of them...? Against just one of you?!

Siege:
One? Oh, my, no.

Siege:
Look behind you.

Londinium Merchant:
You... this is Londinium! I've got friends in high places!

Indra:
Oh? Where are they? Do tell, I bet I'd get on famously.

Londinium Merchant:
Eek! D-Don't do anything rash, now!

Indra:
Play nice with us and nobody has to get beat.

Dagda:
Whatever Siege says, you do.

Dagda:
Otherwise, my claws won't be aimed at the wall next time.

Londinium Merchant:
A-Alright! I understand!

Indra:
...Seriously?

Morgan:
You really got into it there.

Dagda:
I learned it from you lot.

Siege:
Now then, let him go.

Londinium Merchant:
*whimper*...

Siege:
You can open your eyes and put your hands down now, Mr. Bader. We're not going to hurt you... at least not yet.

Londinium Merchant:
What do you want?

Siege:
My terms are clear. Cancel the deal for the Cumberland steam armor.

Londinium Merchant:
And you'll let me go if I agree?

Siege:
Yes.

Siege:
But I'll make sure you keep your side of the bargain.

Siege:
Show Mr. Bader our map, Morgan.

Morgan:
With pleasure.

Londinium Merchant:
The marks on the map... those are my warehouses! How do you know about them?!

Siege:
You don't pay much attention when you're out and about.

Londinium Merchant:
You shadowed me?

Siege:
Correct. The Sarkaz cannot be bribed. If they learn that you've smuggled so much contraband into Londinium through your 'connections'...

Siege:
How helpful do you think your friend will be? Will he be in any position to protect you?

Londinium Merchant:
......

Siege:
You're considering tipping off the Sarkaz.

Siege:
That may well get us all killed, but they won't have to know anything if you continue to work with us.

Londinium Merchant:
Do I have a choice?

Siege:
I understand your circumstances, and I appreciate the opportunity to work with you. You will be compensated fairly.

Londinium Merchant:
Wait a second...

Londinium Merchant:
What is your relationship to Allerdale Cumberland? Are you her attendant? I can't imagine House Cumberland is in any position to hire one...

Indra:
Watch your mouth! The Cumberland serves Vina, not the other way 'round!

Londinium Merchant:
She's the daughter of a duke! You don't mean...

Siege:
No. I'm nobody.

Siege:
Lady Cumberland and I are comrades, along with thousands upon thousands of Londiniers who long for peace.

Siege:
I do hope you're one of them, Mr. Bader.

Knight:
All those loyal to this land stand with me. The final battle against evil lies before us.

Knight:
Children... do you live here?

Knight:
Hide not in the corners and shadows. Even if you cannot hold a sword...

Knight:
There is more to being a warrior than simply holding a sword. Open your eyes. Watch, listen, think.

Knight:
Tell me what is right, what is wrong, and what kind of life you wish to live.

Knight:
I march onwards, with you as my witnesses.

Molly:
Brilliant! Look how good Ralph is, Lady Golding... how much he's grown. And to think he was a mischievous little beastling just four years ago!

Golding:
Yes, I'm delighted. A handkerchief, Molly?

Molly:
Handkerchief? Oh, yes, I can't stain my clothes with tears in front of the children... Oh, but I just can't stop crying, to think that Ralph and the other kids will be leaving school so soon...

Golding:
It's time for them to have a rest. And us, too.

Molly:
Yes, the final scene... that's the best part.

Molly:
Who's clapping?

Molly:
You didn't invite anyone to the rehearsal today, did you?

Golding:
......

The teachers cast their glances toward the back of the classroom.

A man in military attire claps slowly by the door.

???:
What a splendid performance.

Golding:
...Lt. Colonel Lettou.

Golding:
I didn't think the Commander of the Defense Forces would grace this classroom with his presence.

Lt. Colonel Lettou:
Good afternoon, ladies.
