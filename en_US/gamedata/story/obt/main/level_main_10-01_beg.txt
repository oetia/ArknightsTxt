7:25 A.M. \ Overcast

Ten kilometers from Londinium, wilderness highway

Rhodes Island Operator:
Blacksteel's aircraft was about a hundred meters ahead of our position when its signal disappeared.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Let me grab the telescope to pinpoint the precise location–– Wait, why are you standing up?!

Indra:
Do you smell the smoke?

Rhodes Island Operator:
Don't think so...

Indra:
You can put that lump of metal down. The aircraft is right ahead.

Rhodes Island Operator:
You want to scout out the enemy's numbers first?

Indra:
Can't be any more than thirty.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Uhh, you can tell all that from smell alone?

Indra:
The hell are you talking about? Before we left, Morgan told me they usually run in squads of thirty.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Oh, right, that's what the intel Misery sent back said. Patterns tell us they should have two other squads nearby to offer mutual support.

Indra:
Hmph. They act like they own the damned place.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Don't do anything rash. Amiya said not to make too much of a ruckus before we get into Londinium. Too many forces have their eyes on us.

Indra:
Balin, how long has it been since you joined the bunny's squad and started working with us?

Rhodes Island Operator:
About five days since leaving the landship.

Indra:
And do you know how long it took for Siege to go from joining the Glasgow Gang to becoming my boss?

Rhodes Island Operator:
...No.

Indra:
Two days. She only needed two days.

Indra:
First day, she beat me down. Second day, we beat down a band of ill-intentioned Leithanians.

Indra:
Since then, we've had a bond that goes beyond life and death.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Even though we haven't been working together very long, I have full confidence in your strength, Indra.

Indra:
That's what I like to hear. Let's go, we need to catch up to Dagda.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Dagda's already moved out?! Are you telling me dark shadow that shot past was...

Indra:
When she first joined the gang, she had her nose turned up like some fancy knight-noble. Now whenever there's a fight, she's the first one to leap in.

Indra:
We're gonna have to pick up the pace, or she'll clean house before we even get there.

Indra:
Dagda throws a mean punch, and I can bet you she'll flip on top of the aircraft from the side. We'll wrap around the back, get rid of anyone there, and bust our way inside.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Alright, I'll cover you then.

Indra:
After this fight, you'll be a blood brother.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Ha... Haha...

Indra:
If I was to describe it in Rhodes Island's terms... Lemme think. Something like this...

Indra:
Our objectives are two rescues: one Londinium citizen and one Blacksteel pilot. Opposing forces are––

Indra:
Dublinn.

Dublinn Soldier A:
You, stop squirming. Don't even try to reach for the transmitter.

Londinium Citizen:
D-Don't kill me! My hand's gone numb and I just wanted to shake it out a little...

Dublinn Soldier B:
Don't be too forceful. If you really end up killing the bloke, how are you gonna explain it to the captain when we get back?

Dublinn Soldier B:
Don't forget, this is our objective. Securing our flight back is just a matter of convenience.

Dublinn Soldier A:
Do you know how to operate it?

Dublinn Soldier B:
Not a clue.

Dublinn Soldier A:
And that's why you shouldn't have killed the damned pilot as soon as you got in here! If you ask me, we stop wasting time, take this one back, and leave this rubbish heap behind.

Dublinn Soldier B:
All the men along the road outside are ours. What difference does it make if we take some extra time? The Sarkaz are inside the city, and the Grand Duke's army is stationed in the barracks of the annexed plate. Nobody's gonna bother us.

Londinium Citizen:
G-Gentlemen, are you not Sarkaz?

Dublinn Soldier A:
Your eyes fall out of your head? Do we look anything like that filth to you?

Londinium Citizen:
F-Filth, huh... Haha... You're exactly right...

Dublinn Soldier B:
Enough. Don't talk to the Londiniers unless you're interrogating them. If this runt has the stones to cross the Sarkaz, there's no saying who we might be dealing with here.

Dublinn Soldier A:
You're right, we should be on the cautious side. Hurry it up, I'm gonna see what the commotion is out there.

Dublinn Soldier B:
......

Dublinn Soldier B:
What just happened?

Londinium Citizen:
Sir, my heart's pounding too loud... I couldn't hear anything.

Dublinn Soldier B:
We're under attack?! There's something above us–– M-709, do you see them? M-709?!

Dublinn Soldier B:
Black... claws? Some sort of wild beast?

Dublinn Soldier B:
N-No! It's–– some kind of special weapon!!

Dublinn Soldier B:
All hands, an enemy is hiding atop the aircraft! They're... trying to rip apart the metal––

Dublinn Soldier B:
Ugh–-!

Dagda:
You managed to block me.

Dagda:
The intel was right, you aren't just a band of highwaymen. You grew fat off Victoria's teat, and this is how you repay her, soldier?

Dublinn Soldier B:
*cough* *cough*... You're pretty strong. You working for the devils?

Dagda:
Bastard!

Dagda:
How dare you... I'm pissed enough to beat the tar out of you ten times over.

Dagda:
Remember this, Dublinn soldier. We will reclaim Londinium from her usurpers. Be it from the Sarkaz, or from you traitors––

Dagda:
Your time running around like you own this place is over.

Dublinn Soldier B:
Heh... Hah... Look at you, all high and mighty. You nobles... still trying to cling to the old times.

Dublinn Soldier B:
Looks like you're after this little coward who ran away from the Sarkaz, and the information he has on him––

Dagda:
They're switching targets?!

Londinium Citizen:
H-Help! Save me!

Dagda:
Leave him alone!

Dagda:
This is... a decoy?

Dagda:
You little shit!

Dublinn Soldier B:
Urgh!

Indra:
How many times have I told you? When you're in a fight, always be on the lookout for tricks.

Dagda:
......

Dagda:
You're late.

Indra:
That's because I helped you clean up a band of hooligans outside, no? Hey, tell her, how many did we have to go through outside? Seven, or was it eight?

Dagda:
This isn't a competition.

Indra:
That's not what your face is saying.

Indra:
Back when we went on our first mission together, that one merc got away from you. You were livid for three days. Morgan thought you’d come down with some awful sickness.

Indra:
You had the same look on your face just now.

Dagda:
What happened back then was my fault. Plus, it was a long, long time ago.

Dublinn Soldier B:
*cough* *cough*... Where... did you people come from? The one in black... I thought she was some knight-noble. But the way you hit is like...

Indra:
Like a street thug? Hah, you know your stuff.

Dagda:
Hurry up. That one's no weakling. It'll be tougher to take him down than the unconscious louts out outside.

Dagda:
They're able to freely move between the Sarkaz and the Duke's forces, and even able to control major passages in and out of Londinium. Dublinn isn't some ragtag group of mercs.

Dagda:
We need to rescue the hostages as quickly as possible and get to somewhere safe.

Indra:
I know. 'Your time running around like you own the place is over,' right?

Indra:
That’s a lousy one-liner, not nearly scary enough.

Indra:
Remember what I taught you? What you say is––

Indra:
This is your last chance to beg for mercy.

Dublinn Soldier B:
Ugh... M-701, requesting backup... Captain Mandragora...

Rhodes Island Operator:
Dagda, Indra, we’ve got incoming! I'd suggest we bail!

Dagda:
Got it.

Indra:
Grr... They sure move fast.

Dagda:
You were in charge of recon, you didn't spot anyone nearby?

Indra:
Too much work. We'll just take 'em out as they come.

Dagda:
Balin... please stay hidden. Indra and I will take care of the incoming hostiles.

Dublinn Soldier:
They're inside!

Londinium Citizen:
Ladies, p-please save me! I don't want to fall into their hands again!

Indra:
Gah, shut your trap and do a better job of hiding.

Indra:
Dagda, we're good as long as we bring back the objectives, right? Shouldn't be an issue if we take apart this blasted lump of metal, yeah?

Dagda:
This is one story you're gonna have to tell Siege when we get back.
