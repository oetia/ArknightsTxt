Amiya:
Hmm...?

Amiya:
Where is this...

Amiya:
We're getting close to the coordinates that Frostleaf sent us, but...

Amiya:
What a disgusting smell.

Amiya:
It's the stench of something burning...?

Amiya:
Where did Reunion lead us to?

Amiya:
Tsk! Watch out for the sneak attack!

Amiya:
Darn it...!

Reunion Caster:
I... I missed?!

Reunion Member:
Don't worry. We're safe here!

Reunion Caster:
Guh...

Reunion Member:
Wh-what's wrong?

Reunion Caster:
Guh... urgh... aah...

???:
He won't be able to answer you.

Reunion Member:
Wh-what?!

Amiya:
From that building!

Amiya:
Wait, is that...

Amiya:
Frostleaf! Frostleaf, is that you

Frostleaf:
It is. I've taken care of the enemy.

Frostleaf:
Sorry for making you worry, Amiya.

Frostleaf:
Ugh...

Amiya:
Are you injured?

Amiya:
Medic, hurry!

Amiya:
No way... Why is your body all frostbitten? What happened to you...

Frostleaf:
Don't worry, it's minor.

Frostleaf:
Meteorite and Jessica are still in the main square.

Frostleaf:
They should be safe for the time being, but it's hard to say how long that's going to last for.

Frostleaf:
I managed to lure the enemy out, so Reunion hasn't found them yet.

Amiya:
The enemy?

Frostleaf:
Our cover hasn't been blown yet, so there's no need for concern yet.

Frostleaf:
But, he's going to come soon...

Mephisto:
Where are you hiding, little fox?

Mephisto:
Hurry and come out. Our game of hide and seek is about to come to an end.

Mephisto:
For every minute you stay hidden, I'll break another one of your friends' fingers--

Mephisto:
Do you still plan to keep running?

Amiya:
(Mephisto...!)

Frostleaf:
(He's bluffing. Don't take the bait.)

Amiya:
(What is he doing...)

Frostleaf:
Reunion is moving.

Amiya:
That little...!

Amiya:
We have to get in touch with Meteorite...

Amiya:
...Huh?

Amiya:
Why can't I get through? We've clearly already crossed the contaminated area...

Frostleaf:
*sigh*...

Frostleaf:
Take a look at this.

Amiya:
Your communicator?

Amiya:
...!

Amiya:
It's... frozen over? Did it get... ruined by the frost?

Frostleaf:
Mephisto is a nobody.

Frostleaf:
There's something wandering in this city...

Frostleaf:
...that is far more terrifying.

Amiya:
Something more terrifying?

Frostleaf:
The Yetis. If we run into them, we'll be in serious trouble.

Amiya:
Yetis? Are you talking about the Yeti Squadron? What are they exactly...?

Frostleaf:
I don't have time to explain right now.

Frostleaf:
But they are the ones... behind the sudden temperature drop, as well as our squads' injuries.

Frostleaf:
It seems like this squad has already established their territory within this city.

Amiya:
The sky is getting darker. This is a good opportunity for us...

Amiya:
We'll be able to cross this open area more easily.

Amiya:
Let's go rescue Meteorite and Jessica first.

Frostleaf:
I'll lead the way.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
What are those things in the main square? I can't really see...

Amiya:
Are they... statues of some sort? Their shapes are really strange...

Amiya:
And this smell makes me want to vomit...

Frostleaf:
...

Frostleaf:
Over here. Don't get separated.

Frostleaf:
Don't go look at those things...

Frostleaf:
--We have company.

Frostleaf:
Let's take them out before they notice us.
