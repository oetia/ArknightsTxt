Texas:
Here we are.

Amiya:
--? !

Amiya:
We have to go up to the rooftop?

Amiya:
...This door is locked.

Liskarm:
Stand back, I'll blast it open--

Texas:
...

Texas:
There's no need for that.

Texas:
Just kick it down.

Liskarm:
...

Franka:
Liskarm, you should learn from her.

Liskarm:
I have my own way of doing things. Got a problem with that?!

Amiya:
There's another rooftop in front of us...

Amiya:
I think I'm beginning to understand...

Exusiai:
Amiya, over there! You'll be able to cross over from there!

Amiya:
Where is 'there'... Are you telling us to--

Amiya:
Jump from rooftop to rooftop?

Exusiai:
Bingo~!

Exusiai:
Who would ever expect this? See, this is foolproof!

Exusiai:
You know, Lungmen is a great place with many secrets--

Reunion Member:
You're not getting away!

Exusiai:
...Huh? What's going on? !

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Exusiai, the enemy showed up unexpectedly...

Franka:
I already sealed off the entrance, so how...

Amiya:
Could they have come from the nearby buildings...

Amiya:
They seem to be wearing some rudimentary jetpack, but it's enough to get the job done.

Amiya:
We'd be at a disadvantage if they managed to sneak through places we aren't able to defend...

Exusiai:
Tch... Hold on, I'll be there to help you shortly.

Franka:
Don't take too long, my little guardian angel.

Liskarm:
Defenders, get into formation! Pronto!

Texas:
...I'm going in.

Amiya:
Everyone, protect our vanguard!
