Uptown Lungmen 7:00 P.M., Dusk

L.G.D. Officer:
A secret arrest warrant? For Ch'en Sir?!

L.G.D. Officer:
It's gotta be a mistake? There's no way...

L.G.D. Officer:
Hey! Get back here! I asked you if this was a mistake or not!

L.G.D. Officer:
Damn it, Ch'en Sir, what the hell... who's behind this?!

L.G.D. Officer:
I have to find her. I have to hear her side of the story!

Rat King:
...Yes. I understand.

Greytail:
Anything else, Master?

Rat King:
No. Go and do what I told you for now. When you're finished, find somewhere to lay low for a while.

Greytail:
Got it.

Rat King:
Now go. Hurry.

Rat King:
Ah.

Rat King:
——*Sigh*. It turns out there really is someone who can outplay Wei Yenwu.

Rat King:
Talulah, Talulah... is this really just fate?

Rat King:
Oh, Young Master, if you could see us now from up there, you also would not wish to see this, would you?

Rat King:
But alas, Lungmen's finally come to this.

Rat King:
But Hui-chieh... Hui-chieh! Be careful, Hui-chieh... You mustn't get yourself killed!

Lungmen Harbor Dock 7:20 P.M.

Herd:
Guh... agh! Nng... grrgh...

Rhodes Island Operator:
Damnit, there's still so many of them out there... I thought the L.G.D. was supposed to have this area under control?

Rhodes Island Operator:
Yesterday it was Reunion, today it's these weird Infected. Even we can't hold them off. And we can't use heavy-duty weapons inside the city...

Rosmontis:
Hello, Operators. Is that who we're fighting today?

Rhodes Island Operator:
Rosmontis! Thank goodness, we're saved.

Rosmontis:
They're Infected who have been twisted by Arts...? And we can't stop them?

Rhodes Island Operator:
That's right. We mostly brought defense equipment, but I never expected that they'd shred through our steel cables and polyfiber nets like paper. We might have to bring in some military-grade weapons.

Rhodes Island Operator:
We're at our limits here, so we had no choice but to ask for backup from the landship. Thankfully, now that you're here, we might be able to turn the tides.

Rhodes Island Operator:
The Originium structure inside makes their bodies incredibly tough. We use suppressing fire to keep them under control. Also... our scans aren't picking up any signs of brain activity at all.

Rhodes Island Operator:
The main point there is, they're pretty much... already physically dead. They're just empty husks, propped up by Arts. It's unbelievably cruel...

Rosmontis:
Whoever did this... has to pay.

Rosmontis:
But more importantly, at least you all are safe.

Rosmontis:
Let's make a plan. I'll... get them to settle down.

Rosmontis:
Yes.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Doctor... have you never met Rosmontis before?

Rosmontis:
Please stand aside, Doctor.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Then, you might want to take a step back. I guarantee you've never seen anything like this.

Rosmontis:
It's mine.

Rosmontis:
Operator, please describe your impressions of the target.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Hold on, I'll check the manual... Okay, the target's, uh, a large group of active, restless individuals?

Rhodes Island Operator:
They're moving as a group with no clear objective. Their general trend is clear, but with no set route. That should be good enough, right?

Rosmontis:
Received. I'll handle this.

Rosmontis:
Dr. Kal'tsit was very clear, once we finish with this, Rhodes Island is to leave Lungmen immediately...!

Hoshiguma:
Evening, old friend.

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma...? What are you doing here? How about your injuries?

Hoshiguma:
I'm an Oni. Those scratches are long gone.

Ch'en:
Good. Now, I—

Ch'en:
Hold on. Were you waiting for me here?

Hoshiguma:
That dune buggy you're pushing is a new model from Rim Billiton, right?

Hoshiguma:
'Great for off-road performance. Dustproof, climbs hills with ease, incredible range and fuel efficiency. Minimal environmental impact with maximum comfort.' That one?

Ch'en:
...

Hoshiguma:
Yeah, sorry. I saw that ad on the terminal a million times. Guess it got stuck in the old noggin.

Hoshiguma:
It's a damn good buggy though. I'm not even into off-roading and I'd like to get one.

Ch'en:
What are you trying to say?

Hoshiguma:
You look like hell, Ch'en. Where do you plan on going?

Ch'en:
How did you know I'd be here...?

Hoshiguma:
You come here every time you want to sneak out of the city. Remember, I also know every nook and cranny of this place.

Hoshiguma:
The L.G.D. issued an arrest warrant.

Ch'en:
But that's not what you're here for.

Hoshiguma:
Of course not. I know exactly what kind of person you are.

Ch'en:
This is my only way out of Lungmen.

Ch'en:
I stayed dark the whole way. If the whole L.G.D. knew me half as well as you do...

Hoshiguma:
Then you'll never make it out of Lungmen.

Ch'en:
...Excuse me?

Ch'en:
What do you mean by that?

Hoshiguma:
They're just like me. They don't want you to go.

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma... are you going to stop me?

Ch'en:
Why you, of all people, Hoshiguma?!

Hoshiguma:
Of course I am, Ch'en. I'm an L.G.D. inspector, and more importantly, your friend.

Hoshiguma:
Did you serious plan to wander off and play the lone hero on a grand adventure? That is precisely why I cannot let you leave.

Ch'en:
You're a Lungmenite, Hoshiguma!

Ch'en:
This is our last chance. If Wei Yenwu has it his way, more people are going to die!

Hoshiguma:
And your way is better?

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
They call you 'Madame Oni.' They trust you to take care of the Lungmen they love so much. Let me go, Hoshiguma.

Hoshiguma:
...Hah.

Hoshiguma:
Do they really love Lungmen, Ch'en?

Ch'en:
You—

Hoshiguma:
Me? I'm old school.

Hoshiguma:
Comics, movies, booze, rainy streets, some guy running by without an umbrella. I like my stuff retro, just not bikes.

Hoshiguma:
People say some stuff goes out of style quick. Ch'en, can we really outrun time itself?

Hoshiguma:
I can't. No way. It moves too fast. That chase has crushed so much of what I cared about.

Hoshiguma:
This is all I have left. A yellowed splotch, a tear, a dog-eared page. I've got names for 'em all.

Hoshiguma:
And it sucks. I hate how time took all these people from me.

Hoshiguma:
They died horrible, miserable deaths, sacrificing themselves to try to find a place in this world. But me?

Hoshiguma:
I simply watched them all vanish into dust. Some of them? I smashed their dreams to pieces with these very two hands.

Hoshiguma:
They didn't love Lungmen. They simply had nowhere else to go. And in the end, that was my fault.

Hoshiguma:
You're not going anywhere, Ch'en.

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
Ah Faat died, all those people died for Lungmen... You're going to pretend you never saw any of that?

Hoshiguma:
Don't act like you knew them.

Hoshiguma:
They were with me a lot longer than you. I knew them much better than you.

Ch'en:
It's my duty to protect Lungmen. No matter who stands in my way, it's my duty. That hasn't changed.

Hoshiguma:
So you're still Superintendent Ch'en? And who gave you this duty?

Ch'en:
I did.

Hoshiguma:
...Is that just something you wanted to hear yourself say?

Hoshiguma:
Look at you. You're gonna save Lungmen all by yourself? One woman against all of Reunion? Your temper tantrum won't get you that far.

Hoshiguma:
It's funny. You're the one who always carried out Mr. Wei's orders, because you could relate with him. Now I'm the one who relates with him a bit better, and I'm the one carrying out his orders. How the tables have turned.

Hoshiguma:
I've seen the gist of Mr. Wei's plans. If someone has to die, Mr. Wei thinks it ought to be him. You're carrying the Ch'en family's blood. Once all this blows over, no one's coming after you.

Ch'en:
You mean, he—

Hoshiguma:
Mr. Wei would rather he die than you.

Ch'en:
You give him too much credit.

Hoshiguma:
Maybe you don't give him enough, Ch'en.

Ch'en:
If he wants to die, he's welcome to it. But what will that get us? What's the point? Will it prevent a war? Will it get Lungmen out of this mess?

Hoshiguma:
If he dies, it'll get some of the blame off Lungmen. I think all the blame will pretty much vanish into thin air, actually.

Ch'en:
You really think it'll be that easy?

Hoshiguma:
Nothing's ever that easy. That's why he wants you running the L.G.D.

Hoshiguma:
You'll get his job and be Chief of the L.G.D. sooner or later. After that, you'll become the boss of the entire city.

Hoshiguma:
There's been a lot of rot left behind, and you should be the one to clean it out.

Hoshiguma:
I get what Mr. Wei wants from you. Though he's been waiting for a long time, I can tell that his beliefs and methods haven't changed from the day I met him.

Ch'en:
...

Hoshiguma:
Lungmen still needs you. And she doesn't want you in danger.

Ch'en:
I'm just so disgusted.

Hoshiguma:
Mr. Wei's death may not matter to you. But once he's gone, you can change this city.

Ch'en:
I have to tell you something, Hoshiguma. It's the reason I don't belong here.

Hoshiguma:
Don't mess with me, Ch'en. No one's more Lungmen than you.

Ch'en:
I'm an Infected.

Hoshiguma:
...What?

Hoshiguma:
...

Hoshiguma:
...Since when...?

Ch'en:
Three years ago.

Hoshiguma:
You've been hiding it from me?

Ch'en:
I didn't mean to...

Hoshiguma:
How come you didn't even tell me...?

Ch'en:
Wei Yenwu didn't want anyone to know. We couldn't have an Infected in the L.G.D. So I couldn't be Infected.

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, there is no place for the Infected here. Or anywhere else in the world.

Ch'en:
I've had enough of Wei Yenwu controlling us. I'm not going to be his tool anymore.

Hoshiguma:
No. I get it.

Hoshiguma:
I finally... actually, really get it, Ch'en. I know exactly why you can't leave Lungmen.

Ch'en:
...What?

Hoshiguma:
If you leave and go to that core city, Mr. Wei would have to brand you an enemy. Not just an enemy, but a dangerous Infected enemy working against Lungmen...

Hoshiguma:
The whole city would know you're Infected. They might even think you're working with Reunion.

Hoshiguma:
And that'll be the end of it. You'll never be able to come back.

Ch'en:
I don't care.

Hoshiguma:
That's my line.

Hoshiguma:
'You're Infected? I don't care.'

Hoshiguma:
I don't care. Missy doesn't care. Nine doesn't care. The L.G.D. doesn't care.

Hoshiguma:
Not even Mr. Wei cares. He wants you to change this place. He doesn't want you gone.

Ch'en:
You didn't see how ruthlessly he treated the Infected. I did.

Ch'en:
And Nine? She's already gone. She quit the L.G.D. because she was Infected too.

Hoshiguma:
...Nine too...?

Ch'en:
You know, Nine and I might've contracted Oripathy on the same mission.

Ch'en:
She went undercover for me in Reunion... And then, because of Reunion, she abandoned Lungmen.

Ch'en:
Because she saw the truth of this city.

Hoshiguma:
But you didn't betray Lungmen. I'm not letting you take the fall for a crime you didn't commit.

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, why do you think... I'm going to the core city?

Hoshiguma:
I've never been good at guessing games. Just get to the point.

Ch'en:
Heh...

Ch'en:
Do you know who's leading Reunion?

Hoshiguma:
I forgot her name.

Ch'en:
Talulah.

Ch'en:
Missy didn't tell you?

Hoshiguma:
Tell me what?

Ch'en:
Talulah is my sister.

Hoshiguma:
Oh. Ohhh... Hah. I get it.

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, you're not going today.

Ch'en:
...Why...? Is my sister, my family... not important enough?!

Hoshiguma:
That's why...

Hoshiguma:
That's why I can't let you go.

Hoshiguma:
Even if I have to die here. I'm not letting you go.

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
That's not for you to decide, Hoshiguma.

Hoshiguma:
Hannya can decide.

Ch'en:
—No matter what stands in my way, whether it's a Catastrophe, a shield, or an Oni, I'm not giving in!

Hoshiguma:
The blacksmith who cast this shield had his whole family killed by a gang of wandering Onis. His fury is much more toxic than any Catastrophe.

Hoshiguma:
The blood that stains this shield, and the tragedy it represents... is much more wicked than any Catastrophe.

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, Mr. Wei isn't a good man. We can kick his ass together.

Hoshiguma:
Whatever you want to do, I'll do it with you. You want my Columbian Big Single 70 vv? It's yours.

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, now's not the time. Don't go. Don't force me to do this. It's all I ask.

Ch'en:
Force you? Why are you talking like Wei Yenwu...? I don't like it.

Ch'en:
When Wei did what he did... no.

Ch'en:
When he betrayed his brother, failed my mother, and put this city to sleep under his cloud of wickedness, that's when I decided to do this.

Hoshiguma:
You might think that stuff has anything to do with you, but I don't think so.

Ch'en:
What do you mean...?

Hoshiguma:
What he did, what he did for you, and what you should be doing, none of it is connected.

Hoshiguma:
That's what Mr. Wei was hoping for. He didn't want to play the bad guy. He's not power-hungry...

Hoshiguma:
He gave you the sword.

Ch'en:
...You don't get it.

Hoshiguma:
Understand what?

Hoshiguma:
It wasn't just one time. It happened again, and again, and again... I destroyed my home, I destroyed my family.

Hoshiguma:
Covered horn to toe in blood every time, I fought to the bitter end, until I was the only one left standing.

Hoshiguma:
Because that's what I thought was right. And they were wrong.

Hoshiguma:
I found myself asking a lot if I really deserved to live.

Hoshiguma:
I don't. But I lived anyway. I just can't live for myself anymore.

Hoshiguma:
Putting yourself out because of some concept of right and wrong... that's the dumbest thing a person can do.

Hoshiguma:
And I've dealt with the regret my whole life.

Hoshiguma:
You think you're the only one who's got a lot of baggage, Miss Ch'en?

Ch'en:
Stop talking like that!

Hoshiguma:
...So why can't you understand me, even a little bit?

Hoshiguma:
We've been through so much together, all these years. There's still something you can't tell me?

Ch'en:
I've got my baggage and you've got yours. We both know that. Even so...

Ch'en:
What is there you still don't understand? I never pulled any of you into this! How can you say I don't understand you?!

Hoshiguma:
Because I've seen too many people die for nothing.

Hoshiguma:
I don't care who you are. I just care where you're going.

Hoshiguma:
I'm not letting you go. This is all on the leader of Reunion. You can't change the situation. You'll just die for nothing too.

Hoshiguma:
No one wants to see that. Not the L.G.D., not Lungmen.

Ch'en:
—Thank you, Hoshiguma.

Ch'en:
But I'm still going.

Hoshiguma:
Really?

Ch'en:
If we have to fight, you should know I'm not scared of you.

Hoshiguma:
You really have to go, huh? You feeling like your heart is hard as iron right now?

Hoshiguma:
I told you before, you're lost in your own thoughts, you lost sight of everything around you, of everything everyone's done for you.

Hoshiguma:
Your stubbornness is only gonna get you hurt.

Ch'en:
Hmph.

Hoshiguma:
Fine. I guess you'll have to take a beating before you can learn, like a young Hoshiguma, that being a stubborn ass is just a stupid impulse.

Hoshiguma:
If you want to fight, Ch'en... Then let's do it. Show me everything you've learned in the last two years.

Ch'en:
Stop. Talking. Like. That.

Okay. I'm going.

Please tell Closure for me, about the Rhodes Island landship startup.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Hurry, Doctor, get in the cabin. Don't watch.

Rhodes Island Operator:
If you get hit by Rosmontis's shrapnel, you're pretty much a goner.
