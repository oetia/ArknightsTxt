Mephisto:
It's your turn to move.

Mephisto:
If you can kill me here, all of my forces will collapse.

Mephisto:
It would be such a pity if you refused to even have a chat with me. Please, come kill me - if you can, that is.

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en!

L.G.D. Agent:
The enemy's attacks are too overwhelming! We can't afford to drag this out any longer!

Mephisto:
The situation is quite straightforward - only one of us will survive.

Mephisto:
I promise to keep my last words short, Madam, as long as you can make me say them.

Ch'en:
Do you think yourself a martyr?

Ch'en:
Nobody will remember you after you die. Being dead and being respected are two completely different matters. What matters is what you've done in life, not how you die.

Mephisto:
I obviously wish for nothing more than to play with worthwhile foes, and then to die a worthwhile death.

Mephisto:
But I don't think you'll be able to help me fulfill my desires after all. You will suffer a terrible defeat, Madam. Now it's my turn to point out the situation that you're in.

Ch'en:
Your confidence was built upon the fall of Chernobog.

Ch'en:
But this isn't Chernobog, nor is this the ruthless land of Ursus.

Ch'en:
The mighty Lungmen will not fall into the hands of scum like you.

Mephisto:
Well said.

Mephisto:
Faust.

Faust:
I know.

Mephisto's Guard:
GROOAAAAAR!!

Mephisto:
Was that a slash? N-no, impossible! Could this be... Arts?!

Faust:
Back off.

Mephisto:
What... How can this be?

Mephisto's Guard:
(Groans in anguish)

Mephisto:
Don't be afraid!

Mephisto:
It won't hurt you. There's no need to be afraid.

Mephisto's Guard:
UNNGGHHH...

Mephisto's Guard:
...

Ch'en:
Phew...

Ch'en:
(He's too far. It's only going to get harder for me to close the gap. I'm at a disadvantage if this drags out.)

Mephisto:
Your skills are formidable.

Mephisto:
You used your Arts to detonate Faust's attack in advance, and broke through my formation. Your blade even cut through my guard's neck and almost reached me.

Mephisto:
If I had let you come a few steps closer, you would have cut me in half. Not even Faust would've been able to stop you.

Ch'en:
You won't be so lucky next time.

Mephisto:
Unfortunately, there won't be a next time. Your secret has been exposed, Madam.

Mephisto:
You've heard the saying - never try the same trick twice. You can't fool your audience again after the secret comes out.

Mephisto:
The distance between us is greater than your Arts' range, isn't it?

Ch'en:
The rooftop is only so big. You don't have much room to move back.

Mephisto:
How much closer can you get?

Mephisto:
Faust, show her what real Arts are.

Ch'en:
I know your position all too well. An exposed sniper poses no...

Ch'en:
You...

Mephisto:
You are remarkable, Madam Ch'en. Are you able to cut through any shot fired at you? Just like before, I could barely even see your movements.

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
Sniper, I was attacked by you and someone from 3 o'clock simultaneously. But there's nobody in that direction.

Ch'en:
I doubt you're that kind of caster.

Mephisto:
There's no need for you to try to guess, Officer. You won't figure it out.

Ch'en:
Tsk.

Mephisto:
Now, how many shots will you be able to deflect? Ten? Forty? A hundred?

Mephisto:
But, how about the shrapnel? The blast? What about the Arts inside?

Mephisto:
Are you able to stop all of it?

Ch'en:
Nonsense.

Mephisto:
Then, let's keep going!

Mephisto:
Officer, I know what you are. My Originium Arts only work on the Infected.

Ch'en:
I don't care.

Mephisto:
Don't you know that you're only going to become his pawn, to be discarded when you've served your purpose?

Ch'en:
You can have those words back.

Mephisto:
We will give you a chance. Lungmen will not.

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en, I'm afraid we'll have to make our way down! We can't deal with the enemy's fierce attacks!

Ch'en:
(Tsk... As soon as I want to move, the sniper will attack me from all directions. Just how is he doing that...?)

Ch'en:
(I can neutralize his ranged attacks, but if I let him keep wearing me down, I won't last long.)

Ch'en:
(I'll have to seize victory in a single decisive moment...!)

Ch'en:
I don't care what you have to say. I don't have time to listen to your blathering.

Faust:
(I can see a red aura congealing around her. She's about to use her Arts.)

Faust:
(Mephisto, according to the plan, if I shoot her now, she'll have to stop her casting or she'll die in the explosion.)

Mephisto:
But wouldn't this be the best opportunity to break her spirit? Hold your fire, and just watch her first.

Faust:
We will miss our opportunity.

Mephisto:
Broader strategic goals are more important than the specific tactics used to get there, Faust.

Faust:
...

???:
Come with me! Don't stay here anymore!

???:
Do you not want to leave here? Let's get far, far away from these people, and this place!

???:
Do you really not know? He's the reason why all the adults treat us like this! It's all his fault!

???:
......

???:
I hate this accursed city. I hate him. Don't make me hate you too.

Ch'en:
Chi Xiao—

Ch'en:
—Unsheathe!

Mephisto:
Guards, form a line! Stop her!

Mephisto's Guard:
EEEEAAAAAARRRGHH!!

Ch'en:
Ugh...!

Ch'en:
(N-no! I lost control of Chi Xiao? Why now of all times?!)

Faust:
Her Arts paused. Her casting failed.

Mephisto:
Faust, now.

Faust:
Command, fire.

Ch'en:
Damn it... Scatter!

Mephisto:
What a terrifying weapon.

Mephisto:
Just the dispersion of your Arts was powerful enough to block all the bolts, as well disable three of my guards.

Mephisto:
But you were still hit by the blast, weren't you?

Ch'en:
Ugh... Gahh...

Ch'en:
(One rib, no, two are broken? I can endure it. But this firepower... There's no way I can take another...)

Mephisto:
It's just like our leader said.

Mephisto:
Madam, it's not that you don't want to kill me. You cannot unsheathe that sword.

Ch'en:
What did you say? Who told you that?

Mephisto:
You should know this name, Madam Ch'en. As you said, this sword was not to be meant to be used against someone like me. Your recklessness disrupted its intended mechanism.

Mephisto:
If we seized the opportunity to attack you while you were defenseless, you would have already been turned into dust. She already knows all your weaknesses.

Ch'en:
You waste your breath.

Mephisto:
We will destroy this world as it currently is.

Mephisto:
If we allow the rampant corruption to grow, the entire world will rot away.

Mephisto:
Only by cutting it all away can these rusted cities break free from their chains and be born anew.

Mephisto's Herd:
GRAAAAAAGHHH!!

Ch'en:
Out of my way.

Mephisto:
Come, Madam Ch'en. Aren't you also very disappointed in Lungmen?

Ch'en:
...

Mephisto:
Our leader is waiting for you. There's no reason why you need to bow your head to Lungmen, is there?

Ch'en:
I have my duties.

Mephisto:
That has nothing to do with which side you take. While you keep talking about these mundane 'duties,' you know just how our fellow peoples are being treated.

Mephisto:
Just give me a sign, then I'll call off the attack immediately. Come, join us. Let us work towards the greater good together.

Ch'en:
*Spits*. This mouthful of blood is the only sign I have for you.

Ch'en:
What kind of noble goals could Reunion possibly have if they hire a lowlife like you? Spare me your nonsense!

Mephisto:
So, that's how it's going to be. If you don't believe me, then that's your loss.

Mephisto:
You can spend your last moments squirming all you want. My guardian and his bolts will show you the true power of the Infected.

Mephisto:
You are all alone, while we are united and strong. Your death will be fitting.

Ch'en:
Save those rotten words until after you're dead.

Mephisto:
Or, you could forcefully activate the Originium Arts imbued in that sword. Something terrible will happen, right? I'll let you decide your own fate.

Ch'en:
Do you think you'll get a hero's death?

Ch'en:
Listen, brat. When one dies, nothing is left behind.

Ch'en:
If I have to sacrifice myself to kill you...

Ch'en:
I'll do it, even though it's not worth it.

Mephisto:
Hmph.

Mephisto:
We have nothing more to talk about then. Goodbye, Madam Ch'en. Faust.

Faust:
Command, f—

Ch'en:
Tch...

???:
You don't need to go that far, Madam Ch'en!

Ch'en:
...?

Mephisto:
What's that?

Ch'en:
A helicopter? No, that doesn't look like one. It's...

???:
Blaze, jump!

Blaze:
Mind your landing posture! Don't leave my heat flow!

L.G.D. Agent:
What's that? Someone's jumping down?!

???:
'As terror rises, her eyes become blind...'

Mephisto:
Damn, Rhodes Island? From above?!

Mephisto:
These black lines... Wait, is that you...

???:
'...As the tears dry, she weeps silently.'

Mephisto's Guard:
...Nghh...

Mephisto's Guard:
...Nngh, uuughhh...

Mephisto's Guard:
Ughh.... Aaaargh! Ugh!

Mephisto:
What's going on here? Why are my guards screaming as if they're grieving?

Mephisto:
My Arts should have wiped all their emotions, so why? What's going on?!

Mephisto:
Is that you?!! Damn you!!

Mephisto:
The Rabbit of Rhodes Island!!

???:
I temporarily restricted their movement, but it'll only last for about ten seconds!

Blaze:
That's more than enough time for me to make a safe zone!

???:
Let's do it, Blaze!

Blaze:
Are we ready to go all out?

???:
Yes, now!

Blaze:
We're about to land - your bottom might get a little sore!

???:
Don't drop me!

Blaze:
Of course!

Faust:
Command, fire!

???:
Don't underestimate us!

Faust:
...My bolts were diverted by the wind? How could this...

???:
Cut the roof apart from underneath those Reunion troops!

Blaze:
Sure thing, but make sure to hold on tight! I can only do this once every few months!

Mephisto's Herd:
Uh... Urgh?

Mephisto's Herd:
Aaaaaaaghh!!

L.G.D. Agent:
She cut a huge crack through the roof of the building!

Ch'en:
I know. Watch out for falling debris!

L.G.D. Agent:
What's going on here? How'd she do that? What happened?!

L.G.D. Agent:
Woah, a lot of Reunion's forces fell onto this level!

L.G.D. Agent:
Forget them, hold on tight!

Swire:
Hello, hello?

Swire:
You don't need to be in such a hurry to get yourself killed.

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
We're in the middle of a crisis. What are you doing on this channel?

Swire:
Oh, I just wanted to tell you that I'm done with my mission.

Swire:
Rhodes Island has something really powerful, and they'll be here with it soon.

Ch'en:
They're already here. What was this mission of yours anyway?

Swire:
Coordinating with Rhodes Island.

Blaze:
Safe landing!

???:
Blaze, you can put me down.

Ch'en:
You... you guys...

???:
Madam Ch'en!

Ch'en:
Amiya...!

Amiya:
Sorry it took us so long to get here, Madam Ch'en.

Amiya:
In accordance to our agreement, Rhodes Island will now be supporting you.

A few minutes ago...

4:21 A.M. \ Overcast

Call Sign: 'Bad Guy', 40m above L.G.D. Headquarters, Upper Lungmen

Blaze:
Why are you so enthusiastic about this? She left you to die in that ruined city, so isn't it only right to let her wallow in her helplessness?

Amiya:
Blaze, don't be like that. Dr. {@nickname} is right. We have to resolve Lungmen's problem first.

Amiya:
Otherwise, everything we've done will have been for naught.

Blaze:
Fine, if that's an order, I'll do it.

Blaze:
I know.

Blaze:
But to be honest, I don't really want to help that woman.

Amiya:
Blaze, we can't let all our efforts over the last three months go to waste.

Blaze:
Hitting me with the cost versus benefit, huh? Whatever, I just have to do it.

Amiya:
Some things can wait until after Lungmen is safe.

Blaze:
When that time comes, we're gonna make a fortune!

Blaze:
I mean, we look like we've been beaten up even worse than her, right?

Blaze:
What a pain. I didn't expect that woman in the ruined city to be so arrogant. Kal'tsit never even gave me a heads up...

Amiya:
I'll treat you to curry after we get back to Rhodes Island.

Amiya:
We can take some time to rest up afterwards. But right now, we need to put an end to this battle once and for all.

Blaze:
All right, we have a deal. Let's go!

Mephisto:
Why are you bunch here?

Amiya:
We have to be here, Mephisto.

Mephisto:
What the hell is FrostNova doing? What's going on with her anyway? Did she pass out again?!

Mephisto:
You accursed rabbit... You and your entire rabble were supposed to freeze to death in Chernobog!

Amiya:
I cannot die yet.

Amiya:
As long as Oripathy continues to plague these lands, our battle will never end.

Amiya:
We will rid the world of psychopaths like you, as well as the persecution that the Infected face!

Mephisto:
Aha... Ahaha...!

Mephisto:
Come, little rabbit, if I am your enemy, then come kill me! Kill me! Kill me right now!

Amiya:
No... You are not my enemy.

Mephisto:
Then I will slaughter you!

Amiya:
If you seek a glorious death, you will not find it here. I only wish to destroy your hatred and malice.

Amiya:
What happens to you is of no concern to me. But look at the Infected around you. Your death will bring nothing to them.

Mephisto:
You...!

Amiya:
I have no empathy to spare for the likes of you, at least for the time being.

Mephisto:
Are you trying to make an enemy out of Reunion, out of all of us? Do you want to taste how deep the wrath of the Infected runs?

Amiya:
Not all Infected are the same. You and Miss FrostNova have nothing in common. Not everyone in Reunion is a psychopath like you.

Mephisto:
What did she tell you? That woman...!

Mephisto:
Aren't you misunderstanding something?

Mephisto:
I am the one who can control these cities and bend all these pawns to my will! Not her!

Amiya:
That's why... If someone has to bring you to justice, then I will be the one to do it!

Blaze:
That's right. Plus, weren't we enemies long ago?

Amiya:
Right!

Amiya:
We became enemies the moment you began to spread terror and tragedy!

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
Amiya.

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en, please hold on a bit longer. Our support squad will be there shortly.

Ch'en:
Sorry.

Amiya:
Huh?

Amiya:
...There's too much noise. I didn't hear your battle plan, Madam Ch'en.

Ch'en:
Hah. I know.

Amiya:
Give us your orders, Madam Ch'en.

Ch'en:
Yan has an old saying, 'to catch bandits, you must first catch the ringleader.'

Ch'en:
In other words, if we want to destroy our enemies, we have to capture their commander first.

Ch'en:
Be careful. His mindless minions will rise up again and again.

Ch'en:
Free them from their suffering if you can.

Amiya:
...I understand.

Amiya:
Doctor.

Amiya:
Okay!

Amiya:
Blaze, I'll break their formation with my Arts. I'm counting on you to push back their attacks!

Amiya:
We have to take some of the pressure off from Madam Ch'en!

Blaze:
She's certainly strong, but do you think she's that strong? Do you think she can take down those two by herself? I highly doubt it.

Amiya:
I trust that the Doctor's leadership will help her get the job done.

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
Dr. {@nickname} of Rhodes Island.

Ch'en:
I'll be engaging the enemy commander next.

Ch'en:
Hmph.

Ch'en:
Regardless of what I said before, you have my trust this time.

Mephisto:
...

Mephisto:
Rhodes Island, are you in cahoots with Lungmen now?

Mephisto:
Now that I'm seeing this for myself, I'm starting to realize how shameful this is for us Infected.

Blaze:
It only took four of us to drive you into the corner. The only shameful thing here is you!

Amiya:
Mephisto, your atrocities end here!

Mephisto:
Faust! Wipe them out, every single one! Get them out of my sight!

Faust:
Yes...

Ch'en:
It's time to end this battle.

Ch'en:
Only then... can we prepare for the next one.

Ch'en:
Your orders, Dr. {@nickname}.
