Exusiai:
So, what do you think about Penguin Logistics, Amiya? We're pretty good, aren't we?

Amiya:
Yeah, you're great!

Exusiai:
W-woaaah!

Exusiai:
It feels pretty embarrassing getting complimented by a little girl!

Texas:
Watch your mouth. She's our client.

Exusiai:
Oops, sorry about that!

Amiya:
Don't worry about it. It's you who we should be thanking!

Texas:
So, we've met up with Rhodes Island.

Texas:
What's next?

Amiya:
I might need the L.G.D. to come to a decision before I give my input.

Texas:
Is that so...

Texas:
I'll ask them to come take a look over here then.

Hoshiguma:
This terrain...

Hoshiguma:
Reunion must have lured us here on purpose.

Franka:
Nothing but sand and rocks in this wasteland. It's got all the makings of one of those movie showdowns.

Franka:
The only thing that's missing is the enemy, huh?

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, stay here and back up Rhodes Island.

Hoshiguma:
Hm? Very well.

Ch'en:
I'll take the L.G.D. and change positions.

Ch'en:
If this stalemate continues, we won't be able to control Reunion's escape routes.

Hoshiguma:
Understood.

Hoshiguma:
You take care as well.

Exusiai:
--Wooah, that was a really strong wind.

Exusiai:
Ugh... The visibility's getting really poor too, I can barely see ahead of me...

Franka:
Don't go any farther.

Liskarm:
Reunion might wait for us to fall into their trap before they attack again.

Liskarm:
We can't let that happen.

Franka:
How about this, Amiya.

Franka:
Liskarm and I will fight for control over the high ground around here and scout out the enemy.

Franka:
Until we notify you, stay in this position.

Franka:
Just don't rush out to us even if looks like the fighting is getting intense, Amiya.

Amiya:
I know. I'll make my own judgment call.

Franka:
Doctor, you keep an eye on her too!

Liskarm:
We'll be in touch.

Franka:
The ruins are empty. The high ground is currently undefended.

Franka:
That's curious, does Reunion not have any commanders?

Amiya:
Franka, is something wrong?

Franka:
Those place was supposed to be easy to defend but hard to attack.

Franka:
There's no way that Reunion hasn't set up an ambush...

Reunion Member:
Die, traitors!

Franka:
Tch... No sense of honor.

Amiya:
...Franka!! Behind you!!

Amiya:
I see Reunion forces coming up from the nearby ruins!

Reunion Member:
*cough*... I couldn't see... her sword?!

Reunion Member:
How... is that possible...

Franka:
Haha!

Franka:
Did you really think you could ambush us from there?

Franka:
Don't you think you're underestimating me?

Reunion Member:
...Blacksteel...!

Reunion Member:
Fall back! Hurry!

Franka:
I really thought there'd be more Reunion goons up here. I was even walking on tiptoes.

Franka:
Turns out it's just a bunch of cowards. How disappointing.

Liskarm:
You're going to get disappointed over that?!

Liskarm:
More importantly, we have to go after them! Don't let them get away so easily!

Liskarm:
Amiya, what do you think?

Amiya:
I think... it's best not to risk it!

Amiya:
Let's let Penguin Logistics stabilize the situation before we decide on the next thing to do.

Amiya:
Exusiai, can you prioritize securing the high ground?

Exusiai:
Sure thing! I'm on my way!

Amiya:
Good, continue pressuring the enemy. Don't let Reunion stage a counterattack!

Texas:
...

Texas:
Reunion is trying to regroup after retreating a bit.

Texas:
They're... bringing something out!

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Watch out.

Amiya:
That thing...

Amiya:
is no ordinary thug!

Amiya:
I never expected Reunion to be working with...

Franka:
Could that be...

Liskarm:
Working with who?

Liskarm:
...

Liskarm:
You're right, this Reunion soldier does look different...

Amiya:
Could it be...

Amiya:
(Liskarm, we're currently working with the L.G.D.... It's probably not the best time to be talking about sensitive topics!)

Liskarm:
(Ah, understood.)

Amiya:
(I'll tell you my theory next time!)

Texas:
*yawns*...

Amiya:
Everyone, please get ready!

Amiya:
This... might be a very difficult battle!
