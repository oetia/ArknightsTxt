10:20 A.M. \ Overcast

527km out from Londinium, operation platform of an abandoned mine

Kal'tsit:
Docking complete.

Warfarin:
Nothing out of the ordinary... Phew. Maybe you should take a break now?

Warfarin:
Or are you going to start...

Kal'tsit:
Quiet.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Dame Kal'tsit, it's been a while...

Warfarin:
T-Th-This rotten smell...

Peculiar-looking Elder:
A Vampire. In a doctor's gown too... How strange.

Warfarin:
*Hiss*...

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Retract your fangs.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Not even the oldest red eyes dare to approach my flesh. They are cowards all, and fear my seething anger could cause their fangs to rot.

Warfarin:
Kal'tsit, how many Sarkaz are there who could cause me to lose my composure, even for a moment?

Kal'tsit:
There's at least one, right in front of you.

Kal'tsit:
It's been a long time since I last saw an old Sarkaz hero walking Terra. I presume there must be a reason that you are gracing these barrenlands with your presence, King of the Nachzehrer?

Peculiar-looking Elder:
You could say I'm here to visit an old friend.

Kal'tsit:
We've met twice.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
You looked very different the first time.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
As for the second time...

Kal'tsit:
I saw someone outside the ship on the day of her accident... So that was really you.

Kal'tsit:
I thought the Nachzehrer Court had already made its choice when it turned a blind eye to an assassination that despicable.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Be it then or now, the nachzehrer have only ever had one choice. We are Sarkaz, and we are loyal to the Sarkaz, not the throne or the crown, much less ancient witchcraft.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
For the past few centuries, I have feasted on the flesh and blood of countless enemies, and I have witnessed the fall of several Sarkaz heroes.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Some of them died by the blades of their strongest foes, while others were assassinated.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
As such, I am here because I seek an answer.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Tell me—

Peculiar-looking Elder:
What killed the last pure-blooded Wendigo?

Kal'tsit:
......

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Answer me, Dame!

Warfarin:
Kal'tsit! H-Hu-Hurry up and get Mon3tr out! He's going to strike!

Warfarin:
The landship is right there! We can't just...

Kal'tsit:
Hear me, Nachzehrer King.

Kal'tsit:
I will not fight you here.

Kal'tsit:
Buldrokkas'tee has departed the cage that had confined him for his entire life. I will not tarnish his last wish with pointless violence.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Is this your way of commemorating a Sarkaz hero? By running away... so loathsomely?

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
I am not running away.

Kal'tsit:
I gave you the answer you wanted, just like when the Wendigo wanted a fight in place of answers.

Kal'tsit:
I will say it again, Nachzehrer King. I refuse to fight you here.

Kal'tsit:
You feed on the flesh of your enemies and swallow their cries and regrets to fuel your next battle.

Kal'tsit:
Yet we are not enemies. There were times when we fought alongside each other, and there were also times when we had to raise swords against each other over differing opinions.

Kal'tsit:
Likewise, this applies to Rhodes Island and Buldrokkas'tee when he sided with Reunion.

Kal'tsit:
Just as you witnessed her passing, I witnessed the return of a Wendigo soul to Kazdel.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
You say you are his witness.

Kal'tsit:
I am.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
And he chose you himself?

Kal'tsit:
In his final moments... Buldrokkas'tee wanted a fitting opponent, and a friend to talk to.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Hah... hahahaha!

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Very well. I accept your answer.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Now, you show yourself, Confessarius.

Shining:
......

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Had I moved to strike... even if the black monster did not come out, you would have raised your blade against me.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Even I would have to dodge the blade of a Confessarius... That is, if you CAN unsheathe your blade.

Shining:
......

Shining:
You know...

Peculiar-looking Elder:
I've known your kind for centuries.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
On the contrary, I am surprised that you joined the side of that outblood successor.

Shining:
......

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Can you carry the burden of your disobedience?

Shining:
It doesn't matter whether I can or cannot. Since the moment I was born, I have carried these sins.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Exactly! You fascinate me more than the masked one in Londinium!

Peculiar-looking Elder:
And the Great Banshee, the young one. Is he not here?

Peculiar-looking Elder:
He is young in years, but his mother taught him well. If he were here, your odds would be a fair bit higher.

Kal'tsit:
Your anger has quelled, Nachzehrer King.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
That does not mean I do not wish to kill you.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Let me ask you. Is this ship built atop the remnants of a colossal artifact still the field base of the Sarkaz King-in-exile?

Kal'tsit:
We never once called ourselves that... not even when she was still alive.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
You still won't admit it, even though the outblood successor has now led her forces to Londinium?

Kal'tsit:
Amiya knows her role.

Kal'tsit:
We don't want a war to break out before our eyes. There should be no more needless sacrifices... Both Victorians and Sarkaz have shed more than enough blood already.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Poppycock! A hapless child who dares not call herself King presumes to save the Sarkaz!

Kal'tsit:
I would never presume to persuade the king of a Sarkaz court.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
At least you know your place, then. It takes far more than your debate skills to win the approval of the courts.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
The outblood successor will face a challenge in that iron fortress unlike any before.

Kal'tsit:
Is that why you allowed Amiya into Londinium?

Kal'tsit:
The nachzehrer take their nutrients from war. Failure brings nothing but unproductive decay.

Kal'tsit:
It seems you still have your doubts about whether the Military Commission's resolution will truly bring victory to the Sarkaz.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Nonsense!

Mon3tr:
(Alerted growl)

Kal'tsit:
Not now, Mon3tr.

Kal'tsit:
Nachzehrer King, I'm not doubting the leadership of the Sarkaz army. Just as you said, I'm here to talk to you as an old friend.

Kal'tsit:
Thanks to the Victorian dukes, Londinium is now an impenetrable fortress, yet Theresis is still able to summon the kings to the city.

Kal'tsit:
This tells us that you and your army are guarding the passages into Londinium, yet you did not stop our infiltration.

Kal'tsit:
You had the opportunity to kill me and destroy Rhodes Island.

Kal'tsit:
But you didn't.

Kal'tsit:
And that's because of... Amiya.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Heh...

Peculiar-looking Elder:
How would I know whether it is rebirth or destruction she will wreak unless I get to see her wear that black crown with my own eyes?

Kal'tsit:
You will.

Kal'tsit:
She will surpass what you... no, what any of us could ever imagine.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
Let's put an end to our friendly conversation.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
An eternally young dame, a free-willed vampire, and... a Confessarius who left her kind.

Peculiar-looking Elder:
We shall meet again in Londinium.

Warfarin:
Phew... He's gone, Kal'tsit.

Warfarin:
Truth be told, that really got my blood pumping. I've lived for a few centuries now, but there are still a lot of things I haven't finished.

Shining:
In his eyes... the real battlefield lies elsewhere.

Shining:
That's the only reason he let Rhodes Island be.

Warfarin:
And I was just saying I don't want to go back to Kazdel... Even if I don't go looking for trouble, trouble's knocking on my door!

Warfarin:
Kal'tsit, we can't let something like this happen again. Otherwise, I'm not sure I can guarantee Rhodes Island's safety. We could be in trouble the second you two leave the ship.

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
It's time for us to depart.

Kal'tsit:
Shining, what's your decision?

Shining:
Doctor... Liz and I are ready. We can leave at a moment's notice.

Kal'tsit:
I noticed that you did not deny the Nachzehrer King's accusations.

Shining:
There is no point... in denying it.

Shining:
For the past three years, life aboard Rhodes Island has been peaceful. Neither Liz nor I could have asked for more.

Kal'tsit:
Is it time to say our goodbyes, then?

Shining:
Doctor, you know very well that if we continue our journey together, both you and Amiya will be in much more danger.

Shining:
However... if Rhodes Island needs us, we will remain.

Confessarius Guard:
Sir, Defensive Cannon S-309 has been activated—

Confessarius:
Looks like Manfred has made some progress.

Confessarius Guard:
Should we report this to the Regent?

Confessarius:
No need. All of this is according to His Majesty's plans.

Confessarius:
Manfred still needs more concrete achievements if he is trying to earn the Court's trust. Capturing some fighters is far from enough.

Confessarius:
Activating the secondary cannons is the first step. Tell him that His Majesty needs not one, or even several unimportant plates.

Confessarius:
Should it be necessary, we can abandon even an entire district...

Confessarius:
......

Confessarius Guard:
What's the matter?

Confessarius:
Stay still.

Confessarius Guard:
The enemy? Here?!

Confessarius:
Stay still, if you want to keep your head.

Confessarius Guard:
......

Confessarius:
......

Confessarius:
What an unexpected guest.

???:
You don't seem very surprised.

Confessarius:
Hmm... Let me put it another way. We've been waiting for your arrival.

Confessarius:
The ship is stopped somewhere in the barrenlands outside Londinium, and I thought you would only have just made it to the walls.

???:
......

Confessarius:
Nonetheless, this is hardly surprising. Assassins are always on the move, no?

???:
You talk too much.

Confessarius:
I have you to thank for giving me the opportunity, then.

Confessarius:
If you want to kill me, why not just do it? Your control of the shadow is so masterful that not even I could notice you immediately. And your breathing...

Confessarius:
It seems you did not neglect the techniques you learned from His Majesty after leaving his side. He will be happy to know that.

???:
Shut up.

Confessarius:
Letting your emotions get the better of you is unbecoming of an assassin.

???:
......

Confessarius:
How nimble.

???:
You're tougher than the others. Sure enough.

Confessarius:
Is that why you didn't strike first?

Confessarius:
The life of a Confessarius is not worth taking if it means trading your own... I see. You have yet to see His Majesty, since you've entered the city.

The shadow shows no sign of change. It does not move, much less answer.

The Confessarius gazes past the swath of emptiness to the window and beyond. There is nothing but another swath of emptiness there.

A golden ray of light flutters from his motionless hand toward the faint sunlight outside the window.

Confessarius:
When you reach the throne... you might meet much more than just His Majesty.

Confessarius:
I look forward to seeing the look on your face, Ascalon.

Theresis:
So they have arrived.

Confessarius Guard:
Yes, Your Majesty. Our leader has already met one of them in the legislature.

Theresis:
Inform Manfred. We must find out who is among them.

Confessarius Guard:
The young general should have already met with our Messenger, but...

Theresis:
He can handle this matter.

Confessarius Guard:
We understand your trust in Manfred, Your Majesty.

Confessarius Guard:
But I must emphasize that he is busy dealing with the rebels on all sides. Judging by the results, it seems he did not immediately detect Rhodes Island's approach.

Theresis:
Tell me the candidates.

Confessarius Guard:
The kings have shown keen interest in that fake for some time now. Aside from the two who have already begun their moves, the Sanguinarch has also grown tired of superfluous social engagements with the city's nobles.

Confessarius Guard:
He is happy to head to Sudean, to Manfred's aid.

Theresis:
Remind him.

Theresis:
That should he ever find the 'The Sarkaz King' and {@nickname}, bring them to me at once.

Confessarius Guard:
What of the Dame? Of course, the Nachzehrer King will keep an eye on her, but we must be prepared too.

Theresis:
Let the vampires deal with her as they see fit.

Confessarius Guard:
Very well, Your Majesty. I'm sure the Prince of Blood will be elated.

Confessarius Guard:
On another note, our leader would like to know if you would have us arrange more guards to secure your surroundings?

Theresis:
No need. If anyone wishes to call on me, let them come.

Confessarius Guard:
There is one more thing... Suppose 'she' wants to meet with that group, should we interfere?

Theresis:
......

Theresis:
Let her go.

Confessarius Guard:
In that case, what if 'she' meets her old friends from Rhodes Island...? Will that be a risk?

Theresis:
You'll remind me now that the witchcraft of the Confessarii is unreliable?

Confessarius Guard:
My apologies. Please do not be angered.

Confessarius Guard:
Just as you saw, 'her' ideas and actions represent the Sarkaz will. This will... should be more than capable of defeating any lingering emotions from the past.

Confessarius Guard:
Yet the Confessarii exist to extinguish any lurking problems. Our leader must consider all possibilities.

Theresis:
No need.

Theresis:
A puppet locked inside a cage cannot lead the Sarkaz on the battlefield.

Theresis:
Tell the Confessarii that I will say this only once.

Theresis:
Do not ever insult Theresa again with these excuses... and do not ever insult me again.

Feist:
We should be nearly there.

Rockrock:
Got a signal...

Feist:
What does it mean... Huh? An emergency meeting?

Feist:
Was there some kind of emergency?! Rockrock, we have to get back!

Rockrock:
What about them?

Feist:
The commander's order is to bring them to this position, but she wouldn't have time to see them now.

Rockrock:
Leave them here.

Feist:
That's a bit of a waste of time, isn't it? How about this? I will bring them to the commander...

Rockrock:
No!

Feist:
Huh?

Rockrock:
We still can't be sure these outsiders are the ones we're looking for.

Feist:
Who else could they be?

Rockrock:
That's for the commander and the captains to decide.

Rockrock:
You've already taken a big risk by bringing them into the tunnel without permission and leading them this far.

Feist:
I've already tested them...

Rockrock:
You're quite smart, I'll admit, but you trust others too easily.

Rockrock:
Take a closer look at your new friends. Especially the one who's also into drones.

Closure:
Huh? Who? Me?

Rockrock:
She's... a Sarkaz.

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
Right, Miss Rockrock. They are Sarkaz, and they are also our trusted friends.

Amiya:
We are not like the Sarkaz who took over your home up there.

Rockrock:
Whether they're the same is not for you to decide.

Indra:
What's that supposed to mean?

Indra:
You should've told us sooner you weren't keen on working with us. We wouldn't have squirmed around in these dark tunnels for so long!

Rockrock:
You're locals. If you want to stay, I will welcome you like I welcome all my brothers in arms.

Rockrock:
...but I can't trust them so easily.

Indra:
Ugh... It doesn't matter what you say.

Siege:
We live together. We die together.

Amiya:
It's just as the Doctor said...

Amiya:
Miss Rockrock... We've already exchanged plenty of intelligence.

Amiya:
If you still won't afford us the most basic trust, I don't think we should force ourselves to keep walking this tunnel together.

Amiya:
Mr. Feist, on behalf of Rhodes Island, thank you for assisting us earlier.

Amiya:
We will leave you and find our own way out.

Feist:
Wait!

Feist:
Erm, that's not what Rockrock meant.

Amiya:
I know. I can see where Miss Rockrock is coming from and how she feels. Resentment always has a root cause, and I definitely won't blame her for this.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island has faced similar problems, both before and now.

Amiya:
Whether the suspicion and distrust arose because we are Infected or because we stand with the Sarkaz, it's all one and the same to us.

Amiya:
We will prove Rhodes Island's position with our actions.

Amiya:
But... I hope you can also understand that we can't stand side by side next to someone who looks at us with such a disdainful gaze.

Rockrock:
......

Rockrock:
Well said, Cautus. You're a fine leader, but that's not going to change my position. I am responsible for my brothers and sisters in arms too.

Rockrock:
Feist... Captain Feist. I'll get going now. Send the word out and have everyone get ready. If you've really thought it through, take these people to the commander.

Rockrock:
She will make the final decision, and whatever her orders are, I will follow them.

Feist:
Rockrock!

Closure:
Amiya, did I say something wrong? Our relationship didn't break down because of me, right?

Amiya:
No, Closure. Whether or not we are friends is for Mr. Feist to decide.

Feist:
......

Feist:
Come, my Rhodes Island friends. I sure hope my judgment is correct... Otherwise, my lieutenant definitely won't forgive me, and I won't be able to show my face in front of our commander again.

Amiya:
Very well, Mr. Feist. We'll follow you. It's a good thing that I want to meet your commander too.
