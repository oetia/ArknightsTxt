Amiya:
We've arrived.

Amiya:
...What a depressing place.

Ch'en:
Any mention of this on the news?

Hoshiguma:
None.

Hoshiguma:
By the looks of things, Ursus decided to abandon this place.

Ch'en:
A deserted city, huh...

Ch'en:
It this city has already become a Reunion stronghold, it's only going to cause more and more problems for Lungmen.

Hoshiguma:
It's too close to Lungmen.

Hoshiguma:
But if Skullshatterer was taking commands from this place, we can't afford to ignore it.

Hoshiguma:
But... what exactly happened to this part of Chernobog?

Hoshiguma:
It's impossible for it to have moved this far after being hit by the Catastrophe.

Hoshiguma:
And why would it appear here?

Amiya:
From the observation data we've gathered... this happened in the aftermath of the Catastrophe.

Amiya:
Which means that this subsection was destroyed only after it reached here.

Hoshiguma:
Hah. Seems like Rhodes Island has some skilled Catastrophe Messengers.

Hoshiguma:
It's good to be cautious.

Hoshiguma:
We've been ambushed by poorly-organized thugs our entire way here...

Hoshiguma:
Like vultures circling overhead, looking for carcasses among the ruins.

Hoshiguma:
It makes my skin crawl.

Amiya:
I've confirmed the coordinates. We'll have to continue moving deeper--

Amiya:
But judging from the terrain, we won't be able to move all our forces together.

Hoshiguma:
Are we approaching the Originium-dense parts?

Talulah:
...

Talulah:
(I didn't expect you to be here.)

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, what do you think...

Ch'en:
...

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en?

Ch'en:
How...

Hoshiguma:
...!

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, where are you going?!

Hoshiguma:
Damn it, she just took off running! Who could that have been...

Amiya:
...I didn't manage to get a good look either!

Amiya:
But that silhouette seemed like...

Amiya:
We have to follow her...

Reunion Member:
...

Reunion Member:
Stop!

Hoshiguma:
What bad timing...!

Hoshiguma:
That guy is no ordinary henchman...

Hoshiguma:
And... where did all of those Originium slugs crawl out from?

Amiya:
Those creatures... look like they might explode!

Hoshiguma:
Dr. {@nickname}!

Hoshiguma:
Make sure our operators exercise utmost caution!!
