Swire:
You're hurt?!

Hoshiguma:
Don't worry. Just a scratch.

Swire:
How is that just a scratch? Come here, I have disinfectant wipes.

Hoshiguma:
Look, I'm fine...

Swire:
Turn your face this way!

Hoshiguma:
Fine, fine.

Swire:
...The wound is deep, but not very wide. It's as if... there's a trace of Arts.

Swire:
...Did old Ch'en do this to you? That blasted woman...

Hoshiguma:
Hah... It's fine. Girls of her age are bound to do stuff like this.

Swire:
...Hoshiguma, I'm really scared. I'm scared that she'll...

Hoshiguma:
That she'll join Reunion?

Swire:
Yeah...

Swire:
I also played with Talulah when I was young.

Swire:
Even though I don't remember very clearly, I do know... that I really liked being her friend.

Swire:
Even if she was bossy and had a temper, she always stood up for us.

Swire:
She never said anything, but she never backed down. She was always the first to charge ahead, and never asked us for help...

Swire:
She beat up kids who were older than her. She was the only one who could get Ch'en to snap out of her funks.

Swire:
I'm afraid that...

Hoshiguma:
She won't.

Swire:
......

Hoshiguma:
I'm telling you, Ch'en's heart is rarely on the same page as her mouth.

Hoshiguma:
But, she will always be Ch'en of Lungmen. No matter what she might say, all her dreams, all her goals, her entire life... has always been right here.

Swire:
So, why'd you try to stop her then?

Hoshiguma:
...I was worried she'd get herself killed. Obviously.

Hoshiguma:
Swire, you'll have an important role in the L.G.D. after this.

Swire:
As if I could do that. I'm not her...

Hoshiguma:
Oh, so you're admitting she's better than you?

Swire:
I just don't think I'm cut out for the L.G.D.!

Hoshiguma:
No, Missy, you absolutely are.

Hoshiguma:
I'm not cut out for it. Neither is ol' Ch'en. Or Nine.

Hoshiguma:
The one who really makes the L.G.D. shine... is you.

Hoshiguma:
You have to take responsibility. You're the only one who can do it.

Hoshiguma:
I'm jaded now, and there's a lot I don't see. I just want this city to become a place that accepts everyone.

???:
I feel the same.

Swire:
You—

Lin Yühsia:
It's been a long time, Miss Swire.

Lin Yühsia:
Hello, Inspector Hoshiguma.

Hoshiguma:
Why is the esteemed daughter of the Rat King at this run-down place?

Hoshiguma:
What are you planning to do to her? Let me say this, if you're planning to harm even a single hair on Missy's head...

Lin Yühsia:
I have no such intentions.

Swire:
You... screwed up.

Lin Yühsia:
Maybe.

Lin Yühsia:
Sometimes, we have no choice.

Swire:
I don't think there's ever a time... where we don't have a choice.

Lin Yühsia:
Look up in the sky.

Lin Yühsia:
It's going to snow. Can you choose for it to stop?

Swire:
......

Swire:
Why... is it snowing?

Go to sleep, go to sleep♪

Daddy's grey hair, Mommy's needles♪

Rhodes Island Operator:
Crap, we're exceeding the solubility threshold! Manually release the exhaust valve, now!

Rhodes Island Operator:
That bout of volatility just caused a violent heat-absorbing effect. If we don't increase emissions, the entire cabin's going to be ruined!

Rhodes Island Operator:
The rainclouds haven't moved much either... At this rate, we're in for some major snow.

Rhodes Island Operator:
This FrostNova... what kind of person was she?

All dreams sink to the bottom of the lake~♪

...'tis a reality that even time cannot shake~♪

Mephisto:
*cough* *cough*...

Mephisto:
......

Mephisto:
Damnit... What an ugly song.

Mephisto:
Damn it!!

Mephisto:
Why was FrostNova so good at it? I really... can't sing well...

Rosmontis:
It's snowing...

Rosmontis:
This old man...

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
His crystallization rate is over sixty percent now. Even a Sarkaz shouldn't be able to move.

Kal'tsit:
His consciousness has already dissipated... However, his iron will continues to ripple from his body.

Kal'tsit:
...Buldrokkas'tee.

Amiya:
Resentment. Hatred. Remorse.

Amiya:
It's all gone now.

Amiya:
The only thing that's left is wrath.

Amiya:
The unwillingness to accept FrostNova's fate. The hostility towards Talulah's actions. The endless longing for Ursus and Kazdel...

Amiya:
A fiery and unquenchable wrath. For all the injustice around the world. For all those who fell around him... Towards those that would play with the fates of others.

Kal'tsit:
To resist fate is to resist everything. Everything that contributes to the idea of 'destiny.'

Kal'tsit:
Buldrokkas'tee's wrath... scorched this entire world.

Amiya:
...This entire, injustice-filled world.

Amiya:
...Mr. Patriot...

Shieldguard:
Move your hand.

Shieldguard:
You, Cautus Infected.

Shieldguard:
...We will complete the Captain's unfinished business.

Rosmontis:
...It's enough.

Rosmontis:
Do you want him to die for nothing?

Rosmontis:
He didn't want any of you to die. He wanted all of you to find another path.

Rosmontis:
He chose to die alone so that all of you could live...!

Shieldguard:
Who said we'll be the ones who die?

Shieldguard:
And we also heard what he said.

Shieldguard:
...Cautus. You're the source of all the ruin to come.

Shieldguard:
The ancient prophecies have all been fulfilled.

Shieldguard:
...Still...

Shieldguard:
FrostNova... and now even the Captain...

Shieldguard:
...No, it's not that we believe in the prophecy.

Shieldguard:
We believe in the Captain.

Shieldguard:
...What?!

Shieldguard:
Yelena... let you try her candy?

Shieldguard:
......

Shieldguard:
No.

Shieldguard:
Rhodes Island, we get some of what you're saying. But we'll never see eye-to-eye.

Shieldguard:
We've followed the Captain our entire lives, but we we didn't do it blindly.

Shieldguard:
If... one day, that Cautus girl there turns into a tyrant like Talulah...

Shieldguard:
We will end you.

Shieldguard:
The Captain fought against all those people... against slavers, oppressors, corrupt rulers, and those who brought ruin. None could escape.

Shieldguard:
The Captain knew. About all the people in Chernobog who lost their lives to the Catastrophe. About all our battle brothers who died in vain.

Shieldguard:
He had his regrets, but knew he couldn't escape. He has set us free now, though. We belong only to the Captain and the ideals he fought for, not to Reunion.

Shieldguard:
We will take up his 'Aegis' from now on. Not as the Aegis of the Infected, but as defenders of all the enslaved.

Shieldguard:
We'll keep an eye on you, Cautus. If you take even a single step onto the wrong path, we swear to hunt you down.

Shieldguard:
We will treat these prophecies... as our secrets.

Shieldguard:
Because before that, we have a tyrant waiting for us in the control tower.

Kal'tsit:
...The person who pushed you into a war against us and brought about this chain of tragedies is the leader of Reunion, Talulah.

Shieldguard:
We're going to regroup. We need to tell the guerrillas the news.

Shieldguard:
As for you... Continue to carry out your mission, if that's what you want.

Shieldguard:
Snow... flakes...?

Shieldguard:
This heavy snow... Is Yelena coming to pick up the Captain...?

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
Amiya, don't be too concerned about it.

Kal'tsit:
The Sarkaz people have a long history with Originium. Their memories mix with Originium and become one with the land, returning to their own bodies.

Kal'tsit:
Sometimes, certain tribes that have long passed down these Originium crystals will gather this information in one place.

Kal'tsit:
Through the continuous use of Arts, this information, mixed together unexpectedly, manifests in different ways.

Kal'tsit:
Most of these messages are lost to time, their contents jumbled or outdated. There is no basis for these prophecies.

Amiya:
But, they directly affect other people.

Amiya:
Like... someone hears these prophecies and starts to try to fulfill them, right?

Kal'tsit:
......

Amiya:
I can't tell if these ideas are just vague whispers... or seeds that can bloom into reality. I really can't tell, but...

Amiya:
He could have killed me.

Amiya:
But... he thought...

Patriot:
I'll kill her now.

FrostNova:
Stop. How are you so sure that she's our enemy?

Patriot:
She is Kashchey's heir! She'll poison us all, just like that old serpent!

FrostNova:
No, you stubborn old man... You're wrong.

FrostNova:
Even if she's bound to turn out like that in the end, we can't kill her now.

Patriot:
......

FrostNova:
Because she's not Kashchey right now. Eh, who even is that? I can't understand you. All I know is, she's just Talulah.

Patriot:
...Who put these ideas in your head? It will twist your will to fight.

FrostNova:
Twist? ...As if, old man. This whole idea of a pure warrior's spirit? If you really had that, I never would've met you.

FrostNova:
If you really had that, we wouldn't be able to sit around a fire and have soup like we are now.

Patriot:
You're... just sixteen.

Patriot:
Did your soup get cold?

FrostNova:
Always been cold. It's better that way.

Patriot:
......

Patriot:
I'll listen to you this time.

FrostNova:
No, Father. That's not how it works.

FrostNova:
If you believe you're right, then... no matter what happens, you should keep on believing that.

FrostNova:
Because if something happens to Talulah, that's between her and her people.

FrostNova:
But reality is just what's in front of us. Right, Father?

FrostNova:
No matter what the future has in store, right now, I am I, and you are you.

FrostNova:
No matter how much you dwell on it, we are who we are today. The only ones who we can change are ourselves, and we are the ones who will make that decision.

FrostNova:
Let's try walking her path and see what happens.

Patriot:
...You'll be a great leader in the future.

FrostNova:
I don't want to become a leader. I just want a comfortable life with my brothers and sisters, my uncles and aunts, and you.

Patriot:
I'll remember that.

FrostNova:
Are you sure?

Patriot:
I won't forget.

Amiya:
Rosmontis... Dr. Kal'tsit... Doctor...

Amiya:
...He could've killed me... Mr. Buldrokkas'tee... could have killed me.

Amiya:
But I saw... I saw what he was thinking.

Amiya:
He didn't do it. He stopped himself, at the end.

Amiya:
I can still... hear him...

Kal'tsit:
Amiya.

Kal'tsit:
Tell me the most important thing. What was the last thing he said?

Amiya:
......

'I have seen. Woe and tragedy.'

'I have seen. Death and carnage.'

'I have seen. Neglect and blasphemy.'

'But someone once told me. It is all in our hands. If in the future, this is all that awaits us...'

'O, little King of Sarkaz. It is all in our hands. If this is fate...'

'Then I reject it.'

Amiya:
He said... He asked...

He sighed...

'My Lord... Where will you go?'

Amiya:
...Then nothing more.

Amiya:
Doctor... I've read it all. I've seen everything.

Amiya:
I read his entire life.

Kal'tsit:
Amiya...

Kal'tsit:
Buldrokkas'tee... He admitted that he betrayed his convictions twice in his life.

Kal'tsit:
The first, was when he left Kazdel and walked away from his life as a Sarkaz warrior.

Kal'tsit:
The second, was when he stood up against Ursus and walked away from his life as a warrior of the Ursus Empire.

Kal'tsit:
And just now... I'd say he made his final betrayal. He betrayed Reunion and the Infected he served, and stopped being a warrior of the Reunion Movement.

Kal'tsit:
With his death ends his last act of betrayal.

Kal'tsit:
But...

Amiya:
He betrayed everything he cared about, because he has always stood up for his beliefs.

Rosmontis:
But this... isn't right, is it?

Kal'tsit:
This kind of 'sublime betrayal' is a sort of release for those who deceive the world. It is an easy way to move things towards the best outcome.

Kal'tsit:
But not for Buldrokkas'tee.

Amiya:
Do you mean that...

Kal'tsit:
Speak up, Amiya.

Amiya:
...Kazdel is Mr. Buldrokkas'tee's home.

Amiya:
Even though he's come so far, he's always wanted to go back to Kazdel... It's not that he didn't want to go back home, but that he couldn't. He had to pay the price first... for his betrayal.

Amiya:
Ursus is his motherland. He fought for Ursus all his life... and blamed himself for the death of his son.

Amiya:
He believed that Ursus was evil, but for the sake of this land, he gave his life... fighting until the very end. He also paid the price for his second betrayal.

Amiya:
This time... he had to stand up against Talulah. But he foresaw that some of the people he strove to protect would die because of his actions.

Amiya:
Even though the decision he made preserved a future for the Infected, he... only felt pain... for the deceased.

Amiya:
This is his third act of betrayal, and the reason he was so determined to atone for it. From beginning to end, this battle was to make up for the consequences of his betrayal.

Amiya:
Through these three times, fate ended up pushing him further and further when he just wanted to turn back. He hated the cruelty and mockery of fate. He never wanted to follow it, but he bore the consequences for it all the same.

Amiya:
Ten years, twenty years... I'd be able to understand. But... too much time had passed. After facing all those regrets for so many years, too much time had passed.

Amiya:
At the very end, even I could not understand.

Amiya:
He could've taken my life, but he stopped at the end.

Kal'tsit:
...He defeated his lifetime of suffering, his centuries-old ideology, and his love for this entire world.

Kal'tsit:
He no longer followed the principles he had adhered to for countless years. He... succumbed to fate.

Kal'tsit:
No, saying that would defile his memory. Rather, he chose to ignore everything he had been resisting, and overcame the final obstacle within his own heart.

Kal'tsit:
He entrusted the future to you. This time, he gladly chose to do what he thought was right, rather than torture himself to maintain a certain ideal.

Kal'tsit:
Of course, deep in his heart, this part is as you described...

Kal'tsit:
It once belonged to Talulah, and now belongs to you. But it has always belonged to FrostNova.

Amiya:
Patriot... FrostNova...

Amiya:
Dr. Kal'tsit. Rosmontis... and Dr. {@nickname}.

Amiya:
I will end this war.

Amiya:
Right here. Right now.

Rosmontis:
Right.

Rosmontis:
I'll be with you, Amiya. Always.

Kal'tsit:
......

Even if you can save many people, you'll cause immense suffering.

Anger. My anger comes from the injustice that fate has dealt to this world.

Kal'tsit:
After countless years... are things finally coming to a head?

Kal'tsit:
How could something like that happen? This prophecy... is it not just another fragment of Sarkaz history?

Core City Warehouse District

Sarkaz Mercenary:
...Hm?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Why is one of Patriot's men over here? This isn't your patrol area.

Guerrilla Fighter:
You, let him go.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Ngh...!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I'll let it slide this time. A little warning, don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong next time.

Guerrilla Fighter:
I just received news.

Guerrilla Fighter:
...Patriot has passed away.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
What?!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
......

Sarkaz Mercenary:
That's some big news.

Guerrilla Fighter:
So, right now... we have no more reason to keep up this charade.

Guerrilla Fighter:
Your band of devils smells far worse than any of our Sarkaz.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
What happened? How did Patriot die?!

Guerrilla Fighter:
Take care of this Reunion scum first!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
You're picking a fight with the core city?

Guerrilla Fighter:
What's wrong with that?

Rhodes Island Guard?:
...Even Patriot is dead. You bastards... I won't tolerate you any longer!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
If Patriot is dead, then what value does Reunion even have?!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Guerrillas! If there's anything I can do to help... tell me!

Guerrilla Fighter:
First, we're going to throw everyone who would toy with the lives of the Infected... right off these city walls!

Kal'tsit:
Mantra-2, put on the uniform. Closure has already hacked the identification code, so make sure not to reveal your hidden weapons.

Kal'tsit:
News of the incident should have spread already. What we need now is...

Elysium:
Chaos?

Kal'tsit:
No, order. Go help the guerrillas. Let the Infected, the well-intentioned Reunion members, and those who fight against injustice rally under one banner.

Kal'tsit:
Just as if Talulah was unable to engineer Patriot's death.

Reunion Member:
What...? What? What did he say?

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Patriot is dead!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
The one who was truly looking out for Reunion! The one who fought for all of us! Patriot is dead!

Guerrilla Fighter:
Talulah orchestrated this conspiracy against Patriot! ...She's an agent of Ursus!

Reunion Member:
Who'd believe your nonsense?!

Reunion Caster:
Wait... Talulah has been acting strangely. She gave an order forbidding us from maintaining communications in the city.

Reunion Member:
What does that prove?!

Reunion Member:
It proves... that the mercenaries are going to ambush the guerrillas! I see their plan... those lunatics!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
You—

Guerrilla Fighter:
Stop! Don't fight us, if you value your lives. Otherwise, we'll destroy you!

Guerrilla Fighter:
We are the Aegis of the Infected, and we'll battle every last enemy for our peoples! Even if we have to stand against Talulah!

Guerrilla Fighter:
For Patriot!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
For Patriot!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Things have gotten a bit messy. You should leave soon.

Phantom Crossbowman:
What about you?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Us mercs have our own priorities. We don't care about Talulah's plots. Do your best, and live on.

Guerrilla Fighter:
For the future of the Infected!

Phantom Crossbowman:
For...

Phantom Crossbowman:
...Captain Faust!

Phantom Crossbowman:
For all our comrades who've been betrayed by Talulah! For Faust!

Patriot is dead! Patriot is dead! Talulah betrayed Patriot! Talulah betrayed us all!

Are you sure it wasn't an outsider that killed him? I saw someone else kill him, not Talulah!

Patriot plotted with the Ursus Army to try to kill the Leader! Open your eyes and see the truth! Patriot is the traitor!

......

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
Patriot must have foreseen this.

Kal'tsit:
But, his struggle against the storm was in vain. Even the 'Aegis' have adopted his most radical ideas, and not his pragmatic approach.

Kal'tsit:
After all this, the core city should descend into chaos. The Reunion Movement no longer exists.

Kal'tsit:
Rosmontis, is this the revenge you wanted?

Rosmontis:
......

Rosmontis:
No, not yet. Not like this. I haven't seen the target yet. No...

Kal'tsit:
No matter who you face, the outcome is the same.

Kal'tsit:
Reunion is just a symbol. No matter who is caught up in it or what they do... they are not an individual. They act as a part of Reunion.

Kal'tsit:
Revenge... will only get you this far. We cannot distinguish their faces. We can only eliminate the symbol itself.

Kal'tsit:
Rosmontis, you can continue to carry out your wishes. But... do you find this kind of vengeance satisfying?

Rosmontis:
Kal'tsit...

Rosmontis:
Am I wrong?

Rosmontis:
I... I just...

Kal'tsit:
It would be irresponsible of me to give you the answer.

Kal'tsit:
Only you have the ability to pursue the things that you hold to be true. Rosmontis, I might not be the person who can answer that question.

Kal'tsit:
Anger is entrenched into our bodies. Do we want to indulge ourselves, to let it flow and condense into hatred?

Kal'tsit:
Or, can we turn it into a higher judge that measures all our future actions and illuminates our sanity?

Kal'tsit:
Do you want to distinguish between right and wrong, or do you want to understand the reason why everything happens?

Kal'tsit:
The lives and deaths of our operators, the sights that shake you... and the reasons why we feel these emotions.

Kal'tsit:
Even if there are certain things that your mind erases, Rosmontis, they will always remain within you...

Kal'tsit:
Maybe there are very few things in our lives that actually come down to right or wrong. Remove all these symbols, and only then do our lives have value.

Rosmontis:
......

Rosmontis:
Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
I'm listening.

Rosmontis:
I want to know the reason.

Amiya:
Dr. {@nickname}. We'll split up for the next part.

Amiya:
Rosmontis and I will go to the control tower. Dr. Kal'tsit will take you to the generator area.

Amiya:
It's just a few hours, right?

Amiya:
By the way, Doctor...

Amiya:
Even if I'm not at your side, I'll always know that Dr. {@nickname} is out there... fighting together with me.

Amiya:
Even out of sight, we still fight for the same goal.

Amiya:
I'm pretty happy with that.

Amiya:
Right.

Amiya:
Madame Ch'en may already be near the command tower. She's always been quick, so we'll have to pick up our pace.

Amiya:
Doctor... Promise me that you'll stay safe.

Amiya:
Our work here only means anything if we make it back to Rhodes Island safely.

Amiya:
Be careful, okay?

Chernobog Core City, Power Supply Sector

3:00 p.m.

Kal'tsit:
Our decapitation strike team will be attacked by Reunion from all directions as they approach the control tower. I can't just drop you off in a battlefield like that.

Kal'tsit:
When we were fighting the guerrillas, we could retreat and buy ourselves time to regroup. That won't be possible for their team. They won't even have an opening to catch their breaths.

Kal'tsit:
This battle has a clear objective, and Amiya and Rosmontis's team can no longer afford any distractions.

Kal'tsit:
You'll be safe with me.

Kal'tsit:
We should only take on responsibilities that we can fulfill.

Kal'tsit:
After entering the sarcophagus, our communications will only further deteriorate.

Kal'tsit:
At that time, we will truly be fighting alone.

Kal'tsit:
Wait...

Kal'tsit:
Doctor, please stay hidden for a while.

Kal'tsit:
...If you don't want to, or if you're feeling claustrophobic, I won't stop you.

W:
Ah... *cough* *cough*...

W:
Where am I? How'd I blast my way down here... Is this it?

W:
Huh? You're...

W:
...Rhodes Island? What rotten luck I have today...

W:
Hm?!

W:
...What an unexpected reunion, Kal'tsit.

Kal'tsit:
...You're gravely wounded.

Kal'tsit:
What do you go by now, W?

W:
Still W. Didn't have time to change it yet.

W:
Hold up, why are you casually milling around a place like this? Don't tell me...

W:
The old man's gone, huh?

Kal'tsit:
Yes.

W:
He died? How is that possible?

W:
But... then again, he wasn't going to survive this. He never backs down, and never lets anyone through.

Kal'tsit:
You sound a bit heartbroken.

W:
Guess so.

W:
That old fella was the only person who made me even give Reunion a second look.

W:
Guess today... was that idealist's last.

W:
——

W:
Kal'tsit, story time.

Kal'tsit:
Do I have something to tell you?

W:
You're asking me? You kidding? How do you have the nerve to stand there all calm like nothing ever happened?

The Sarkaz woman glares at me with eyes that I had never seen before.

Though she directs her words at Dr. Kal'tsit, her eyes are fixed on me.

W:
Kal'tsit, you're working with Dr. {@nickname}?

W:
You? Working together with Dr. {@nickname}?

Kal'tsit:
Is there a problem, W?

W:
Of course, assuming you're not like this bastard here pretending you don't remember anything. But if that's true, guess it doesn't matter...

W:
Otherwise, your brain cells got fried by one of your weird experiments.

W:
Well shit, either I'm the crazy one, or you are. But even if I am crazy, that doesn't make you any less of a loon.

Kal'tsit:
You're still clear-headed, W. Let's save the small talk for some other time.

W:
Don't wanna. What even happened? Just looking at you makes me want to puke.

W:
But even if I'm trying not to throw up, this is just too funny.

W:
Kal'tsit, you finally went bonkers too. Trying to tame the evil spirit of Babel?

Kal'tsit:
Can't prove there are any memories left in this one's head. We're just working together for the time being.

W:
This so-called amnesia... How are you so sure that it's not all an elaborate act?

W:
It might have everyone fooled. Yes, everyone. You're fooled too, whether or not you want to admit it... That's the scorecard I got.

W:
Kal'tsit, you're a monster, aren't you? A monster so smart you got a big, bright, glowy brain.

W:
And a monster should know better than me what happens when you have another monster around.

Kal'tsit:
There are too many creatures in this world that can be called 'monsters.' Throw the word around too much and it'll end up losing all meaning.

W:
Or, you've just gone mad. That's a whole different matter.

W:
There's no place for you to cut in here, friend. When I finish with her, it'll be time for the two of us to have a nice, long chat.

W:
There's no point taking things out on you. Either you have amnesia, or you're just pretending to have amnesia...

W:
But this woman next to you is totally out of her mind.

W:
I want to know—

W:
Back then, there was only one person who entered the Speaker's Office and knew Theresa's whereabouts. Kal'tsit, you know what that means, don't you?

Kal'tsit:
Of course. I know it better than you do.

W:
Those were your words!

W:
So what's the deal? What are you doing now?

W:
Oh, I get it. You're trying to make another exchange. Tit-for-tat.

W:
But it's Theresa on the other end!

Kal'tsit:
Those who don't know the truth shouldn't let conjecture affect their emotions, W.

W:
I have just a single conjecture: You aren't human. Like I said before, if you'll bargain Theresa's death with a murderer... you're just a monster.

W:
You're not human, Kal'tsit.

W:
I need to know the truth. And before I do, that thing next to you is a murderer; and I'll never show mercy to a murderer.

W:
Ahh, I get it now.

W:
You're bursting with motherly love, huh.

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
W, you said before...

Kal'tsit:
'We're the same type of person.'

W:
I don't know where you heard that before, you should pretend you never did. You and I are not the same type of creature at all.

Kal'tsit:
No, W. We are, to some extent.

Kal'tsit:
For example, you also want to put an end to Talulah's atrocities, correct?

W:
...That's true. She's really pissed me off.

W:
So, I need to get my merc back from her. That piece of shit only knows how to squander her people. Such a spendthrift. I'm worried she'll blow all our savings and leave me penniless.

Kal'tsit:
Right, so let's deal with the Reunion problem first.

W:
Sure. I got my targets. Wanna hear?

W:
First is Talulah, that disgusting dragon lady upstairs.

W:
Next is Theresis, the one that makes you want to sneeze as soon as you see him.

Kal'tsit:
Those are some long-term plans.

W:
After that, the third I thing I want to kill is standing right next to you: Dr. {@nickname}.

Kal'tsit:
You're only third on the list?

W:
Hah. That's because I have something to ask you first, Dr. {@nickname}.

W:
I got some some long, thorough explanations to pull out of you...

Kal'tsit:
At this stage, we have a common goal.

Kal'tsit:
By the way, because of what you did to our employees in Chernobog...

Kal'tsit:
First, thanks for saving the lives of Dr. {@nickname} and the rescue team with your deal. Your 'deal' cost us thirteen of our operators.

Kal'tsit:
Balancing these two things, I'm willing to give you a lift, for old time's sake. I'll take you to the command tower.

W:
Kal'tsit... You really know how to gross a girl out.

W:
I've always found you disgusting. I'll have to rearrange your face a little first, see which one of us comes out on top...

Kal'tsit:
Mon3tr.

Mon3tr:
(Howls)

W:
You bitch!

Kal'tsit:
I don't have time to play with her.

Kal'tsit:
Mon3tr, blast through the ventilation pipes, the walls, and the base's outer and middle protective layers along with her.

W:
You old hag!! N-n-n-n-next time, I swear I'm giving you a slow and painful d————

Kal'tsit:
I'm looking forward to it.

Kal'tsit:
Not like you can understand it.

Kal'tsit:
It's not time yet.

Kal'tsit:
When you see for yourself, you should understand.

Kal'tsit:
Secrets are like wellsprings. Sometimes they will flow out, whether you want them to or not.

Mephisto:
.......

Mephisto:
What a strange device.

Mephisto:
Where are you taking me?

Mephisto:
Will you fill the holes in my body, or mend my scars?

Mephisto:
Will you let me forget everything, just like the other one did for me, before?

Mephisto:
If I was to forget everything...

Mephisto:
Do I want to forget?

Mephisto:
I want...

Mephisto:
......

Can I make that choice?

Core City

Ch'en:
...What's going on? Dark clouds? It's snowing?

Ch'en:
But, it's also covered the sun for me. This'll make my next step a lot easier.

Ch'en:
Ugh... I can't afford to take any more hits.

Ch'en:
Tch... Are you scared of shedding a little blood, Ch'en Hui-chieh? What happened to your determination?

Ch'en:
......

Ch'en:
There seems to be infighting among Reunion's ranks. This is the best time for me to move.

Ch'en:
Are my hands trembling because I'm finally going to see you again?

Ch'en:
...I must do what is right.

Ch'en:
It doesn't matter what you are now, whether or not you're the same Talulah I knew.

Ch'en:
Talulah... we have a date.

Swire:
......

Swire:
The snow sure is coming down hard...

Swire:
Just like... that one Christmas.

Lin Yühsia:
You've never spoken to me about that.

Hoshiguma:
Hm.

Swire:
But you already know.

Lin Yühsia:
Me knowing and you telling me are two separate things.

Hoshiguma:
Princess, let's not embarrass Missy over here.

Lin Yühsia:
Madame Oni.

Hoshiguma:
...Let's drop that title, Princess.

Lin Yühsia:
Madame Oni, the Lin family will never forget all you've done.

Lin Yühsia:
But right now, I don't know if there will be an opportunity to reward you for it.

Swire:
What are you talking about? Of course you can.

Swire:
She... I know she'll succeed.

Swire:
Ah Ch'en...

Swire:
Ugh...

Lin Yühsia:
Look at you, where'd all your willpower go?

Hoshiguma:
Ah, what are you gonna do? Missy has always been like that.

Hoshiguma:
Now now, Missy, there's no need to cry.

Swire:
You... Stop treating me like a child...

Hoshiguma:
Don't worry. Everything is going to be fine.

Swire:
But... this is the last time we'll see each other. I'm not ready yet... What if... I never see that smelly dragon again?

Hoshiguma:
That won't happen, Missy.

Hoshiguma:
There's this phrase that I really like. Mm, it goes like this: 'We'll meet again someday, somewhere.'

Lin Yühsia:
...Yes. And when we look back at each other again, we will ask about our lives.

Talulah:
...Why?

Talulah:
What's going on? Where are these tears coming from?

Talulah:
It's as if... someone just told me about a death.

Talulah:
Who is it?

Talulah:
Everything in the core city has been unfolding according to my plan.

Talulah:
Patriot will die by the hands of the Infected, and the Sarkaz mercenaries will start fighting the ordinary Reunion forces.

Talulah:
Oh.

Talulah:
Patriot is dead? So it was Patriot.

Talulah:
A true warrior. Such a name was not enough to describe you. Ursus itself was too small for your greatness.

Talulah:
A patriot to the very end.

Talulah:
...Why am I crying? Is it out of nostalgia, or a courtesy to those who want to kill me?

Talulah:
'All sins must come to an end?'

Talulah:
Then we shall see. If we are the sinners, then we will inevitably meet our end...

But I shall wait for you at that end.                      But I shall wait for her at that end.

Wei Yenwu:
Why are you here, Kojui?

Rat King:
Just like all those decades ago. When people get anxious, they make stupid decisions, and they end up pacing around here.

Rat King:
Funny, isn't it? Still haven't kicked this old habit after all these years.

Wei Yenwu:
Do you know what I'm going to do, Kojui?

Rat King:
I do happen to know. All thanks to that niece of yours, of course. You two are both cut from the same cloth of stupidity.

Wei Yenwu:
......

Wei Yenwu:
Kojui, you're not out here on a stroll. Even if you were, you shouldn't waste my time.

Rat King:
Is it ever a waste of time to talk to an old friend?

Rat King:
Do you not consider me a friend anymore, Wei Yenwu?

Rat King:
If you do, promise me...

Wei Yenwu:
I can't. I won't promise you anything.

Rat King:
So be it. You're not going anywhere today.

Wei Yenwu:
...Don't think too highly of yourself.

Rat King:
That's what I should be saying to you. Wei Yenwu, you've been up in that tower of yours too long, it's bad for your character. Come down and let out some of that hot air - it's good for you.

Wei Yenwu:
Better not blink, old windbag.

Rat King:
What are the two of us... but a pair of old windbags?

It's hard to imagine.Even the old Patriot can die.

Should I laugh? Should I shed a couple tears?

What's really funny is now that he's dead, you climbed all the way to the top of Reunion, second only to the Leader.

Ah, you've really outdone yourself. You should give yourself a pat on the back, W.

*clap* *clap*

Why do we cry? Because even he is dead. Ahh, alas, poor Patriot!

What thoughts went through his head as he died, and what was it like? Did he die on his feet or on his knees? If even he can die, then who among us can live?

Maybe he was the most likely to die.

Never knew how to keep a low profile. Only knew how to cling to a vague ideal. On this path he walked and walked, until everyone around him was gone. And then, he could finally rest in peace.

How sad.

Wait, doesn't that sound a bit like you, W?

Ehh? How am I anything like that?

W, don't lie to yourself. You're practically the same.

Nah, I never lie to myself. I'll never become like Patriot, because I can't.

I just can't.

Besides, death was... kind of a release for him, right?

But not for you, W. Death is the game of your life.

What doesn't kill you, puts you one step closer to death.

The closer you get to death... the closer you also get to madness.

W:
Thanks, Kal'tsit.

W:
I dunno how I would've gotten out of that trash heap without you.

W:
Oh yeah, Talulah...

W:
Can you hear me, Talulah? Knock knock?

W:
Forget it, it's no big deal. I just wanted to let you know...

W:
——I'm back.
