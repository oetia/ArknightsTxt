Dublinn Soldier:
Gah! The lift fell over––

Dublinn Soldier:
If it had been a little lower, m-my leg would've...

Mandragora:
Hold on.

Mandragora:
I mean, hold on to my construct!

Mandragora:
You idiot... Don't drag me down too! It's hard enough to stay afloat bringing you bunch with me!

Dublinn Soldier:
C-Captain... Thank you...

Mandragora:
Next time, be smarter about how you run so you're less of a nuisance.

Dublinn Soldier:
Watch out, Captain!

Mandragora:
That's... an artillery shell?

Mandragora:
No, it's far more destructive than normal artillery...

Mandragora:
And, it was aimed so precisely at a small area?

Mandragora:
......

Mandragora:
Manfred... You've been watching us this whole time?!

Mandragora:
Bloody hell, that slimy devil!

Mandragora:
Alright, everyone stop right here! We don't need to chase after those Sarkaz. As for the driver...

Mandragora:
He's dead.

Mandragora:
This accursed place...

Horn:
......

Londinium Citizen?:
Lieutenant, wh-what is this...

Horn:
............

Londinium Citizen?:
How can the city's defense artillery do this...?

Horn:
Londinium's wall defenses were built almost seventy years ago.

Horn:
This is the first time...

Horn:
Their cannons have been aimed... inside the city.

Manfred:
Not too shabby.

Manfred:
Even 10% of its firepower is enough to melt ordinary structures.

Hoederer:
So this is Londinium's ultimate defense.

Manfred:
That was only an auxiliary cannon.

Manfred:
Our weapon experts have said the main guns are able to easily penetrate the armor of any high-speed warship.

Hoederer:
A weapon expert...? Are you talking about the officer from the defense forces' engineering team?

Manfred:
I must thank you for capturing his wife and daughter.

Hoederer:
Is he still alive?

Manfred:
As long as he is of use to the Sarkaz, he will not die.

Manfred:
Artilleryman, target Lift 11.

Manfred:
The shot went wide.

Manfred:
Unfortunate. We'll have to improve our accuracy.

Hoederer:
These cannons were meant to point outwards, after all.

Manfred:
Outwards... Before we entered Londinium, the defensive artillery was aimed at the ducal army outside the walls.

Manfred:
When we entered the city under the guise of quelling the dukes' conflicts, they never even once thought to put us in their sights––

Manfred:
Does that count as pointing outward?

Hoederer:
Since the fall of Gaul and the silence of Iberia, a long time has passed without Victoria facing any real external threat.

Manfred:
Indeed, which is why His Majesty found this opportunity for us.

Manfred:
Such sophisticated weaponry should be put to greater use, rather than sitting here as ornaments adorning the doorway.

Manfred:
Artilleryman, activate dynamic target tracking.

Manfred:
Very good, it's working.

Manfred:
We had to spend nearly a whole month to calibrate them...

Manfred:
Luckily, they seem to be working well enough.

Manfred:
These weapons put us in control of everything that enters and exits Londinium.

Manfred:
Once all our cannons are in place... There will be nowhere to hide under the shadow of these steel walls.

Horn:
Dublinn seems to be drawing away the artillery fire.

Horn:
Is this... a test run? Is their purpose really just to calibrate...

Horn:
No, they're ultimately unconcerned with this port.

Londinium Citizen?:
Lieutenant, what do we do now?

Horn:
Continue to withdraw towards the city.

Horn:
However... the rest of Sudean is no longer safe.

Horn:
The Sarkaz are tightening their grip on Londinium. As long as the city's artillery is pointed inwards, our lives are in their hands.

Horn:
Unless...

Londinium Citizen?:
What's your plan, Lieutenant?

Horn:
It's nothing. Let's go, we'll talk after we've made our escape.

Mandragora:
These bloody walls! These bloody cannons!

Dublinn Soldier:
Captain, your constructs got destroyed again...

Mandragora:
I don't... have time for this!

Mandragora:
Don't just stand there staring! Away with you! Get out of here!

Mandragora:
Forcing us to run, eh? Mark my words, Manfred, you insult me like this today, I swear I'll...

Dublinn Soldier:
Captain, that one I just saw running off that way... looked rather familiar...

Mandragora:
The Lupo brunette? Is it her?!

Dublinn Soldier:
Be careful, Captain!

Mandragora:
What have you done?!

Dublinn Soldier:
I'm... protecting you... run! You still have to... find... for the Leader...

Mandragora:
Fine... fine.

Mandragora:
You're the thirteenth.

Mandragora:
The thirteenth Taran life. I will mark you down in the Leader's place. One day, I will personally make the Sarkaz pay for each and every life.

Sarkaz Warrior:
General, we've routed Dublinn's team.

Manfred:
I saw.

Sarkaz Warrior:
But we couldn't find the rebels... Those sly insects! They peeked their heads out for a moment, but they vanished again after we activated the cannons.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Uhh, could they have been killed already?

Manfred:
What do you think?

Sarkaz Warrior:
I... I don't think our job would be that easy.

Manfred:
I'm glad you understand.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Then, did they blend into the crowd? Should we notify the patrol so they can detain the civilians and continue the search?

Manfred:
No need.

Manfred:
Continue to bombard the port. Oh, and increase the firepower.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Increase the firepower? The port is almost completely destroyed. I can't imagine anyone would be hiding there still.

Manfred:
They won't ever take this route again. Besides, have you ever seen a Sarkaz draw only half his sword?

Manfred:
Now that we've begun, why not let them see exactly what we're capable of?

Hoederer:
You're putting on a show of force for them. You want... to cut off their escape and force them to come out.

Manfred:
This game of hide-and-seek has gone on long enough. Even if I don't mind waiting, the same cannot be said for His Majesty and the Royal Court.

Manfred:
Doesn't matter who it is. If they have a plan, I'd like them to hurry up with it.

Amiya:
Doctor, we don't have anywhere safe to hide!

Amiya:
Even if we all took cover under the structure, we'd still be...

Closure:
...Vulnerable to their artillery blowing us to bits!

Closure:
I've done some rough calculations. If those cannons are fully charged, they'd be able to shoot clean through a standard city plate! This flimsy sheet plate above our heads on the wall there won't stand a chance!

Closure:
Siege, Londinium's cannons here are serious business!

Siege:
This is the first time I've seen them fired off on such a scale.

Closure:
That means they're rolling out the red carpet for us, right?

Siege:
If that were the idea, we would be wiped out fifty kilometers outside the walls.

Closure:
Urgh...

Closure:
Ahhh, I can't take it anymore––!

Closure:
Amiya, my drones can't reinforce these plates any further. At this rate, we're going to get blasted sky-high!

Amiya:
We need to get out of here.

Amiya:
Dublinn also scrambled to get away as fast as they could... but they used Arts constructs to defend themselves and left their wounded behind.

Londinium Citizen:
Ugh... Argh, why's our luck so rotten...?

Londinium Citizen:
Are we going to die here?

Siege:
We won't leave a single Londinier behind.

Amiya:
Scout team, have you located the artillerymen?

Amiya:
Not yet...?

Siege:
I'm afraid we can't find them.

Siege:
Londinium's urban defense cannons, and this wall looming in front of us, have always been a single entity.

Amiya:
In other words... we have no way of stopping the barrage if we can't scale the wall or get inside it?

Indra:
We can't just hide here waiting to die either!

Indra:
Why don't I run out there and try to draw their fire? With my skills, I should be able to buy a few minutes...

Siege:
Not happening.

Dagda:
If you're not letting her do it alone, then let's all go.

Morgan:
Settle down, you two. Dagda, have you been hanging around Indra for so long that your brain turned to muscle?

Dagda:
Hey...

Morgan:
If it was as easy as getting some live bait out there, would the two of you still be here making a scene?

Morgan:
Our armor could maybe take two hits from a standard crossbow. Our friends in Engineering spent months working hard to make it.

Morgan:
If you're going to run out there and get yourself killed, you never should've come to Londinium in the first place!

Indra:
......

Indra:
Alright, I get it. But I swear, I'm not letting anything happen to Vina!

Indra:
We... haven't even been home yet!

Siege:
Doctor, do you have a plan?

Closure:
Drones...? Hmm, hmm, I see... Oh, so that's where you're going with it. That makes sense.

Indra:
What are you mumbling about now, Closure? The Doctor barely said two words, but you're acting like you had a whole conversation!

Closure:
Oh, my bad. I just got an idea.

Closure:
Those cannons seem pretty intelligent, and at such a long range, they can't be completely manual. They must have some way of locking onto moving targets near the ground.

Closure:
One or two guys running around won't be enough to get the cannons off our backs.

Closure:
If I deploy all my drones at once, the targeting algorithm might see them as a higher-priority threat than us and the civilians, but...

Indra:
But there's no guarantee?

Closure:
Well obviously, I can't promise anything!

Rhodes Island Operator:
Closure, the reinforcement failed. The pressure is too great for the drones to withstand!

Rhodes Island Operator:
The base plate is going to collapse within thirty seconds...

Amiya:
We have no other choice. Let's give it a try.

Amiya:
On the Doctor's signal, all operators prepare to withdraw.

Closure:
Five, four, three––

Closure:
Two––

Closure:
Drones, launching!

Amiya:
Run, everyone! Go, go!

Amiya:
Did it work?

Siege:
It bought us just enough time to move to a structure a few steps away... but this place won't last long either.

Closure:
That was our one shot, too... My precious drones have all been reduced to scrap, and even I can't just conjure up another batch.

Amiya:
We can't safely move forward or retreat backwards. If we want to escape the cannon fire, we're going to have to take some risks.

Amiya:
I wish there were some way around all of this...

???:
I heard you needed a guide?

Amiya:
Huh?

Siege:
Who's there?!

???:
Miss Cautus, I'd like to talk to you.

???:
But before that, I'd appreciate it if you could have your people lower their weapons.

Amiya:
You–– Who are you?

???:
Let's save the introductions for later.

???:
Claws, a machete, and this... Uhh, this hammer? Ma'am, your weapon looks plenty brilliant, but I'd appreciate it if you could keep it away from my head.

Siege:
......

???:
Otherwise, this friend of yours might be in danger.

Amiya:
––Doctor!!

???:
Not too close now.

???:
One more step, and your friend's head becomes a mess on the wall.

Closure:
A-Amiya, the drone...!

Closure:
One of the drones wrapped around when we weren't paying attention, and it's locked onto the Doctor's head!

???:
You sure know your stuff, Miss Pointy-Ears.

???:
To be honest, I'm getting more and more curious about you lot.

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
All hands, weapons down.

???:
There we go, that's nice. Oh, make sure you get the message to your snipers around the corner too. I bet they haven't blinked once since I showed up.

Amiya:
Do as he says.

???:
Lovely.

Amiya:
––Sir.

Amiya:
I hope you believe us when we say that we'd never move to harm a stranger unprovoked, but––

Amiya:
Harm one thread on the Doctor's hood and I promise you, right here, right now, I don't need a weapon to ensure you never threaten another human being.

???:
Ahem...

Closure:
Ugh... This place is already dangerous enough. Are we seriously going to get blown up before we even start our mission?!

???:
Right, if we don't want the Sarkaz to turn us to dust, we don't have time to be pointing weapons at each others' heads.

???:
Listen up, I have an idea. Please come with me, nice and easy.

???:
I'm gonna keep borrowing your friend here until we get where we're going––

???:
Sorry, but you don't get a say. Behave yourself and come along with me, my faceless friend.
