Amiya:
Meteorite...

Amiya:
What exactly did Jessica see...? Were you with her?

Meteorite:
...It's better if you don't find out.

Meteorite:
It has nothing to do with our combat operations... so don't worry about it right now.

Amiya:
...?

???:
How long are you going to keep hiding, Rhodes Island insects?!

Amiya:
(...! Mephisto! Did he find us?)

Frostleaf:
(Don't make any noises. Not yet. It's just another one of his tricks.)

Mephisto:
Aww, still don't feel like coming out?

Mephisto:
Don't think I didn't see your reinforcements coming.

Mephisto:
Well, whatever. I have something to show you. I'm sure you'll like it.

Mephisto:
Looking back now... We were originally planning to take over Chernobog from the very beginning...

Mephisto:
We waited for so, so long... and finally our time has come...

Mephisto:
The moment when we take our revenge against Ursus! Against those who persecuted us Infected!

Mephisto:
But, what about the fellows in this sub-city?

Mephisto:
They ran away.

Mephisto:
They had pretty quick reactions. Ran away before we had a chance to take action.

Mephisto:
Disconnected themselves, and took off as quickly as they could--

Mephisto:
But where did they hope to escape to?

Mephisto:
Our comrades had long permeated every district, waiting for our opportunity.

Mephisto:
In the end, we caught up to them, and gave them the punishment they deserved.

Mephisto:
These cowards, these perpetrators; what were we to do with them?

Mephisto:
It's simple - we would make an example of them!

Mephisto:
A proclamation that all injustices against the Infected would be purged...

Mephisto:
...Yes, that is the symbol of the Reunion Movement...

Mephisto:
Let them all turn into effigies of terror, one by one!

Mephisto:
You, set that nearby effigy on fire! Let there be light!

Reunion Member:
Yessir!

Mephisto:
Come, light up this entire city! Let Rhodes Island see what happens to all of these cowardly oppressors!

Meteorite:
(--Don't!)

Amiya:
Doctor...? !

Frostleaf:
...

Frostleaf:
It's... a burning hellscape of malevolence and madness...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Doctor, let go of me.

Amiya:
I'm fine.

Amiya:
...No, you must let me see it.

Amiya:
One day, I must hold him accountable for his actions. Besides, I used to...

Jessica:
Why... Why...

Meteorite:
Jessica, calm down.

Meteorite:
--That bastard!

Frostleaf:
...This is too atrocious...

Amiya:
The smell of burning flesh...

Amiya:
... ...

Mephisto:
How long to you intend to keep hiding, my dear rabbit of Chernobog?

Mephisto:
I saw your little rabble sneaking around earlier, so I thought you might've been up to something.

Mephisto:
But turns out, you're just here to enjoy the show... How boring.

Mephisto:
Looks like you brought an entire party with you?

Amiya:
Did you do all this?

Mephisto:
Of course~

Mephisto:
Without using some terror tactics, how else were we supposed to minimize the losses?

Mephisto:
Make an example out of these ten percent...

Mephisto:
...and the other ninety percent fall into line.

Mephisto:
This, you see, can be considered the best way of saving lives.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...Doctor.

Amiya:
I am not the same person I was back then..

Amiya:
Even though you might not remember...

Amiya:
Yes... Back then, I was timid, fragile, and easily scared... I couldn't move forward without you...

Amiya:
I might even look the same way right now.

Amiya:
But the difference is, I've now seen more than enough tragedies.

Amiya:
I don't want to see something like this happen ever again.

Amiya:
...But nothing will change unless I face reality!

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
After all, I have to remind myself.

Amiya:
I can't afford to retreat...

Amiya:
I have to continue to fight on!
