Amiya:
At this point... we're out of other options. Madam Ch'en, if you deny my request...

Amiya:
Rhodes Island will act alone.

Amiya:
These actions don't violate any of the terms of our cooperation.

Ch'en:
Of course we'll be there.

Amiya:
...Is that so...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
In that case, thank you on behalf of Rhodes Island...

Amiya:
I know that Lungmen still sees us as Infected...

Ch'en:
It's not a big deal.

Ch'en:
However, I'm not sure if our squads will be able to make it into the ruins.

Ch'en:
We'll have to play it by ear.

Ch'en:
If the situation allows, we will definitely help.

Ch'en:
However, our top priority is still to eliminate Reunion.

Amiya:
That... that's enough for us.

Amiya:
...Thank you, Madam Ch'en.

Ch'en:
Sorry, I have my own duties.

Ch'en:
Did you hear me, Doc?

Ch'en:
We will join up with Rhodes Island.

Kal'tsit:
Amiya, be careful.

Kal'tsit:
This won't be a simple task.

Amiya:
I will.

Kal'tsit:
Right, I've managed to put together some pieces of intel.

Kal'tsit:
Rhodes Island has already deployed rescue squads to assist the other recon squads.

Kal'tsit:
But Meteorite's squad is too far and we cannot reach them.

Kal'tsit:
This is where you come in.

Amiya:
Only Meteorite's squad...

Amiya:
I understand. I'll go look for them.

Kal'tsit:
I'll send you the coordinates later.

Kal'tsit:
Remember, safety is your top priority.

Amiya:
Understood.

Hoshiguma:
So, when are we heading out?

Ch'en:
Right now.

Hoshiguma:
I'll go get ready. Notify the other L.G.D. members.

Ch'en:
All right.

Ch'en:
Amiya, we'll leave from here in ten minutes.

Amiya:
Okay.

Amiya:
Please be safe...
