Faust:
Mephisto?

Faust:
What was that you just unleashed? Your... team is more riled up than before.

Faust:
They're... they're in pain.

Mephisto:
Oh, you can tell? The seeds I planted have finally bloomed.

Mephisto:
Nothing to worry about, Faust. They won't hurt us.

Faust:
You're still catalyzing their infection?

Faust:
Mephisto... just stop. We have a chance to survive.

Mephisto:
I am the only one who can perform such Arts! And it is only through my Arts that we can escape!

Mephisto:
You saw with your own eyes. If we push through like this, the L. G. D. will kill us all long before we can reach the escape tunnel in the slums!

Mephisto:
Have you ever seen those weapons before? Nobody in Chernobog had weapons like that!

Mephisto:
This is their city, they know it far better than us! Where did they come from? Where do they disappear to?! There's no way we can take them on with this few of us!

Mephisto:
The Chernobog Ursus are too weak... Lungmen treats us like an army, but we're no army. We're just a group of like-minded individuals trying to survive!

Faust:
Quiet down. Morale is low enough.

Mephisto:
But my herd will never waver in the face of such challenges!

Faust:
...not to mention all the Reunion members who just joined us.

Faust:
FrostNova will definitely help us.

Mephisto:
FrostNova? That FrostNova?

Mephisto:
Hah! Hahah! As if she didn't take her Yetis and betray us?

Faust:
Mephisto!

Mephisto:
If not, we can definitely crush our enemies with such strength!

Mephisto:
But even if they did turn against us, I can't blame them for doing what it takes to survive.

Faust:
FrostNova is no traitor. I told you. Look at the facts.

Mephisto:
Indeed... we all do what it takes to survive.

Faust:
Just calm down, and don't go stumbling into the L. G. D.'s traps!

Mephisto:
I have it under control, Faust. I will ensure the comfortable survival of all my people.

Faust:
What...? What are you going to do?

Mephisto:
I'm going to show the L. G. D. something much more terrifying than an army. Just wait until they see the flowers that bloom from my people.

Faust:
Mephisto?!

Mephisto:
The L. G. D. must pay for their atrocities... And that Ch'en... She will pay for what she did to you!

Mephisto:
My comrades, my people, heed my words!

Mephisto's Herd:
......!

Mephisto:
A magnificent vitality flourishes within you... Go forth and give in to your impulses, spread your seed, and seize your future!

Faust:
No, Mephisto!

Faust:
They're living beings!

Mephisto's Herd:
(Chaotic howling and shrieking).

Mephisto:
All of Lungmen is your garden! Go, now, spread the life within you to all the people! Go, go, go!

Reunion Member:
Huh? What?! What's happening?

Reunion Member:
Wh- what are you doing? You're not in our squad!

Reunion Member:
...What did I ever do to you?! Or Mephisto...?

Reunion Member:
Captain? Captain?! Captaaaaaain!!

Reunion Member:
Agh! A- are you... trying to... BITE ME?! Why a- aaaaaaaaagh!

Reunion Member:
Help! Somebody help me!!

Reunion Member:
Aaaaaaaaagh!

Mephisto:
Heh heh...

Mephisto:
They are far stronger than they were.

Mephisto:
They can't hear my voice anymore, but they won't attack us again... They will grow stronger, more durable, and more numerous.

Mephisto:
And they will completely consume Lungmen. Hah. If my people can't have this city, I certainly won't leave it to the Lungmenites!

Mephisto:
Faust, come, it's time...

Mephisto:
Faust?

Faust:
......

Faust:
What have you done?

Herd:
......

Herd:
(Pained wailing).

Mephisto:
Faust? Where are you going?!

Mephisto:
Faust!

Reunion Member:
Why are Mephisto's people attacking us?!

Reunion Member:
I saw it... It.. It was awful... Those things took Ivan... And... And then Ivan became like them!

Reunion Member:
Suka! What are you... some kind of monster?! They feel no pain. I stab them and they don't die!

Reunion Member:
They're getting stronger! We can't stop them!

Faust:
Come with me!

Reunion Member:
Faust?!

Reunion Member:
No! It might be one of Mephisto's traps!

Reunion Member:
...He saved my life.

Reunion Member:
Mephisto's a piece of shit. He might be okay.

Faust:
......

Faust:
Get out of here. Hurry. The phantom crossbowmen will cover you.

Reunion Member:
Right.

Reunion Member:
Thanks... H- hey!

Reunion Member:
Look out!!

Faust:
——Originium...?

Faust:
Run! The herd's after you!

Amiya:
GreyThroat, the enemies movements are erratic.

Amiya:
The defenders will hold the line, while the casters cut down the enemy numbers. You and the snipers will take care of any Infected with Arts ability.

GreyThroat:
I'm allowed to shoot the Infected dead?

Amiya:
GreyThroat...

Amiya:
In principle, I can't allow anyone to harm the Infected.

Amiya:
Because, if I were to allow that, then wouldn't someone else allow the Infected to harm others? It's a vicious cycle.

Amiya:
But it's pointless. There's no room for the philosophy of ethics on the battlefield.

Amiya:
The ideal situation is that nobody hurts anybody. Regardless of their infection status.

GreyThroat:
......

GreyThroat:
Understood.

Amiya:
Gavial is providing medical support so... Watch yourself out there. Don't get hurt.

Amiya:
What's that...? It looks like... Mephisto's herd...?

Amiya:
But... I can't sense any emotion from them?

Amiya:
No!

Amiya:
GreyThroat, get down! Something's wrong!

GreyThroat:
They're... pulling Originium out of their bodies?

Amiya:
GreyThroat!

Blaze:
Doctor! Are you okay?

Blaze:
What's with this herd? They're acting completely different!

Blaze:
Doesn't matter. You're safe here. Kinda. Don't move!

Blaze:
I'll take care of them and be back in a sec!
