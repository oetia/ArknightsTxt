Yeti Squad Member A:
All of the Reunion teams I could reach have pulled out.

Yeti Squad Member B:
That's a lot of people.

Yeti Squad Member A:
It's incredible... like a river.

Nesti:
It'll be a river out there in the wilderness... a river of refugees.

Nesti:
There's Ursus and Lugmenites out there. Infected and ordinary folk alike. No matter what they came with, they're leaving empty-handed.

Nesti:
They thought there was a place that would take them. Now they know there's never anywhere they could've gone.

Nesti:
This river won't flow forever.

Yeti Squad Member B:
......

Yeti Squad Member B:
(He sounds so sad.)

Yeti Squad Member A:
(He picked that up from Big Daddy.)

Yeti Squad Member B:
(No wonder. Anyone would get sentimental at a time like this.)

Yeti Squad Member A:
If Big Daddy was here, we would've won the fight and it wouldn't have come to this, huh?

Yeti Squad Member B:
It's the luck of the draw. No use thinking about how things could've been.

Yeti Squad Member B:
......Get ready. I'll go talk it over with the Phantom Crossbowmen.

Yeti Squad Member A:
Don't rush me. It's not like I don't know.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Hurry up already. Quit screwing around.

Yeti Squad Member A:
I'm pretty choked up too!

Blaze:
Are you sure?

Rhodes Island Operator:
It's Yeti Squad.

Blaze:
What about Amiya and her people?

Rhodes Island Operator:
They're already on their way. Amiya said to tell you to 'take it easy'.

Blaze:
......

Blaze:
She knows better than to tell me that. It's me, Blaze. When do I ever take it easy?

Rhodes Island Operator:
Blaze! Where are you going?!

Blaze:
To save lives!

Yeti Squad Member B:
Crossbowmen! Wait up!

Phantom Crossbowman:
Yetis... what are you doing?

Yeti Squad Member B:
It's Sister FrostNova... She's growing weak. She can't keep this up for long.

Yeti Squad Member B:
She exhausted her energy pushing back Lungmen's forces. She may not wake up for a while.

Phantom Crossbowman:
You mean you want us to take her with us?

Phantom Crossbowman:
But we aren't going back to Chernobog. Faust didn't want Mephisto to go back...

Yeti Squad Member B:
We're begging you!

Yeti Squad Member B:
We want Sister to be together with Patriot, in the end!

Yeti Squad Member B:
We know, they're not exactly getting along right now, but... their bond is stronger than blood.

Yeti Squad Member B:
So please... we beg of you.

Phantom Crossbowman:
......

Phantom Crossbowman:
And what will you do?

Yeti Squad Member B:
We'll cover you. If we don't hold them back, the Lungmenites will catch you in no time.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Once you're all far enough away from Lungmen that you're no longer a threat to them, they'll give up the chase.

Phantom Crossbowman:
But that means, you guys will...

Yeti Squad Member B:
Live by the sword, die by the sword. We're okay with dying in battle.

Yeti Squad Member B:
The future that Sister FrostNova spoke of is still a ways away. But we don't need to see it for ourselves.

Phantom Crossbowman:
We owe you our lives.

Yeti Squad Member B:
That's nothing. You're saving our Sister.

Phantom Crossbowman:
...We will do what you ask of us. I swear it.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Take these armguards. And put on this protective suit.

Phantom Crossbowman:
What for?

Yeti Squad Member B:
Our Sister is far too cold for you.

Phantom Crossbowman:
...She...

Phantom Crossbowman:
...She's so light...

Yeti Squad Member B:
The Arts have emptied her body. Easy now, easy...

Yeti Squad Member B:
Don't wake her.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Look at her... look how softly she sleeps.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Goodbye, Sister...

Yeti Squad Member B:
We'll be waiting for you.

Phantom Crossbowman:
...All right then.

Phantom Crossbowman:
Let's... move on.

Yeti Squad Member:
It's us that's moving on.

Phantom Crossbowman:
We'll meet again, Yetis.

Yeti Squad Member:
Not too soon, I hope.

Yeti Squad Member D:
......

Yeti Squad Member D:
Are we going to die?

Yeti Squad Member A:
......

Yeti Squad Member A:
*Ursine profanity*, what are you crying for?

Yeti Squad Member A:
Are you a Yeti or not?!

Yeti Squad Member D:
Are you not crying?!

Yeti Squad Member A:
What am I crying about...?! Did you forget what Sister said?!

Petrova:
She said not to cry.

Yeti Squad Member A:
Right! She said not to cry... More than a decade ago, she said not to cry! So I don't want to see any tears! We don't get to cry... because we haven't won yet!

Yeti Squad Member D:
Once we win, once we're free...

Yeti Squad Member A:
Once we're free, we'll cry our eyes out, in the wilderness, in the snow, in the stacks of wheat piled high, we'll be bawling!

Petrova:
Sister was crying as she said it, you know.

Yeti Squad Member A:
She was only nine at the time. We were all a little older than her...

Petrova:
Without her, we would have died in that mine.

Petrova:
Did you bring the sauce?

Yeti Squad Member A:
Bring the what...? Wait, I thought we weren't allowed to bring it?

Petrova:
You're not allowed to drink on the march, but you had it with you, I know.

Yeti Squad Member D:
I want a drink too...

Yeti Squad Member A:
You're not old enough yet, are you?

Yeti Squad Member D:
B- but I've never tried before. I don't want to die without ever tasting it...

Petrova:
Give him a little.

Yeti Squad Member A:
Petrova...

Yeti Squad Member A:
Fine, take a swig. But not too much, we all need a share.

Yeti Squad Member A:
Na zdorovye, brothers! Warm up!

Petrova:
To Sister! And Big Daddy!

Yeti Squad All Together:
To FrostNova! And Patriot!

Ch'en:
Do you know these Infected?

Amiya:
I do, Officer Ch'en.

Ch'en:
But this final battle must be fought.

Amiya:
Do we have a choice?

Ch'en:
We may not.

Ch'en:
Look behind you. They're not even trying to hide themselves anymore.

Amiya:
...The black raincoats.

Ch'en:
So, we have to fight them.

Ch'en:
This is what we must do. If we don't, we'll fall short. And the business of pushing the special forces into the Yetis becomes pretty unconvincing.

Ch'en:
Unless you could convince them to surrender?

Amiya:
As long as there's Infected behind them... they won't give up.

Ch'en:
...Amiya.

Ch'en:
I won't force you to fight.

Amiya:
I'm sorry, Officer Ch'en. But... but we will witness it.

Amiya:
The L. G. D. fought bravely, no one can deny that. You fought for Lungmen, against the invaders.

Amiya:
This is how we will help you against those special forces.

Amiya:
And for our sake... We must record every battle for the Infected.

Amiya:
Every single one.

Ch'en:
Amiya.

Amiya:
Officer Ch'en?

Ch'en:
When this battle is over, let's grab a bite together.

Amiya:
B- but I'm Infected...

Ch'en:
I don't care. The loudmouth and the tall lady? They won't mind either.

Ch'en:
This battle... it's going to cost a lot.

Amiya:
For us, it's a battle.

Amiya:
For Lungmen, it's a war.

Amiya:
And that's what war is.

Ch'en:
But whoever it was who planned all this, they're not here.

Amiya:
......

Ch'en:
Say, there's something I have to tell you——

Ch'en:
——But not right now.

Amiya:
Yeah. Not right now, Officer Ch'en.

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
Doctor......

Amiya:
...Mhm.

Amiya:
I...

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
You're right. I decided.

Amiya:
I need to see it... with my own eyes.

Amiya:
Together.

Yeti Squad Member D:
So we don't call her Big Sister because she's older than us...? Why am I just learning this now?

Yeti Squad Member A:
Well, it works for you. You were three years old back then.

Yeti Squad Member D:
Pfft!

Yeti Squad Member A:
Hey, what's with the attitude? Did you get drunk off two sips? When you cried out for food, did I feed you or not?

Yeti Squad Member D:
That was then, this is... now!

Petrova:
You know, it's funny. I'm suddenly thinking about those Rhodes Islanders.

Yeti Squad Member A:
Why?

Petrova:
That one cat, with the hot body, the one who said she wanted to drink with us.

Petrova:
It's too bad. She looked like she'd be able to hold her liquor. She looked like a real good time.

Yeti Squad Member A:
But the little rabbit, she can't be old enough yet?

Yeti Squad Member A:
What is she? 16? 17?

Petrova:
More like 14. She just seems older because she talks fancy.

Yeti Squad Member A:
As old as Sister was... back then.

Yeti Squad Member A:
Let's toast them one more time.

Yeti Squad Member A:
So it is said, so shall it be done!

Nesti:
So shall it be done!

Yeti Squad Member D:
Um, uh... so shall it be done!

Nine:
......

Nine:
Lungmenites should be more coordinated.

Reunion Member:
Get out of here. The Yetis can only hold them for a while.

Nine:
You don't think what they're doing is incredible?

Reunion Member:
If we die, then they did it all for nothing.

Reunion Member:
The Phantom Crossbowmen say we can't go back to Chernobog. So we're going to a new place.

Nine:
......

Reunion Member:
You don't care where our new base is?

Nine:
Wherever it is, I'm going with you.

Reunion Member:
Heh. You Lungmenites are no different from us.

Reunion Member:
I was hoping they'd treat you better here. Turns out it's the same as it was in Ursus.

Nine:
Infected suffer the same everywhere.

Reunion Member:
That's not what you said when you first got here.

Nine:
People change.

Blaze:
Yetis? Are those the Yetis?

Blaze:
It's the Yetis! R- right...? Definitely!

Blaze:
Yetiiiis... Yetiiii! Why are you Yetis like this?!

Blaze:
Damn it! Don't die! I won't let you die!

Blaze:
Just hold on, I can save you! I'll get you to safety...!

Blaze:
Why do you Infected want to die here?!

L. G. D. Officer:
The special forces stopped attacking? No, looks like they're pulling back...?

L. G. D. Officer:
Seems... they're giving us the initiative.

L. G. D. Officer:
Are we showing the power of Lungmen's law enforcement? *Lungmen profanity* They underestimated us!

L. G. D. Officer:
...Never mind.

L. G. D. Officer:
Listen up, this is the last wave! Don't disappoint the people, or Ch'en Sir.

L. G. D. Officer:
We'll show Reunion how powerful Lungmen is! The Infected won't dare attack our city again!

Petrova:
Hah...

Petrova:
Phantom Crossbowmen, don't let us down. You have to get our Sister back to the old man.

Petrova:
...She's running out of time. She should spend it with him.

Yeti Squad Member B:
We don't have much time left ourselves, eh?

Petrova:
Ready?

Yeti Squad Member B:
Ready. Let's give back our lives.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Let's show them what the squad trained by Buldrokkas'tee, Ursus's greatest soldier, and led by it's coldest nightmare, can do!

Petrova:
The last of Sister's Originium Arts...

Petrova:
Frost Originium, ready to loose!

Petrova:
Nesti! We're coming!

Blaze:
Yetiiiiiiiiiis!!!
