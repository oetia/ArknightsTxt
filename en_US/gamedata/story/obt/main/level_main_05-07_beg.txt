Ch'en:
Ugh...

Hoshiguma:
That's the third time today, Sleeping Beauty.

Ch'en:
How long was I out for?

Hoshiguma:
A dozen seconds or so.

Ch'en:
...Hoshiguma, step aside. I'll slash apart the debris.

Hoshiguma:
Sorry, but I can't do that. If I move, we're both done for. Let me handle this.

Ch'en:
Your shoulder.

Hoshiguma:
It doesn't matter.

Ch'en:
...You won't be able hold out much longer! You're holding up two floors' worth of rubble on top of your shield!

Hoshiguma:
I don't need to for much longer. Just until you woke up... Squat down, and get ready to dash out.

Ch'en:
...

Hoshiguma:
No matter how heavy it is...

Hoshiguma:
...as long as I can turn it over...

Hoshiguma:
...it's not heavy at all!! AAAAAGH!!

Ch'en:
You...

Hoshiguma:
Gaaah, aagh... Ngh... It feels like I lost my shoulder just to give it that little push.

Ch'en:
You saved me again.

Hoshiguma:
What's weird about that? How many times does that make now? And don't say that to me so earnestly... makes me feel gross just hearing it.

Hoshiguma:
Let me rest a little. I feel like I just broke every bone in my body... Maybe it's your turn to let me take a nap.

Reunion Member:
...Blast, how did they even survive all that?!

Ch'en:
Sure, but the enemy's not going to let you.

Hoshiguma:
No rest for the wicked, I suppose. Looks like I can still stand if I muster my strength.

Hoshiguma:
You should go reorganize the squads, quickly. Don't waste any more time on them - it's what they're after.

Ch'en:
I don't think it's too late to just take them all out first.

Hoshiguma:
Why can't you go check to see who got injured first?

Ch'en:
And leave you here to face Reunion alone despite all your injuries?

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en. What do you think you're doing?

Hoshiguma:
Two years ago in Hua Shui, you were chasing after a bandit leader. My leg was injured, but you believed in me and left me to fight alone. Do you still remember that?

Ch'en:
How long did it take me to catch him?

Hoshiguma:
Three hours. You trusted me back then.

Ch'en:
And I still do.

Ch'en:
You, Reunion! I'll take you all on!

Reunion Member:
Damn it... She's looking down at us!

Hoshiguma:
I can still fight. Why are you staying behind? Why aren't you taking the squads to recapture the L.G.D. Headquarters? Did you forget your main mission?

Hoshiguma:
It's the same as it was three years ago, and it's a responsibility that only you can fulfill!

Hoshiguma:
You did this back at the Muk Wo Warehouse earlier. When did you become so indecisive? Ch'en!

Ch'en:
I don't see any problem with protecting my colleague from these rioters.

Hoshiguma:
You've changed. You used to be much tougher.

Ch'en:
Leaving you here? Of course I could. I used to only look at the risks versus the benefits, but now, it's as you said...

Ch'en:
After what I did to Amiya, I've also been... conflicted.

Reunion Member:
You'll taste the rage of the Infected! Attack!

Ch'en:
Maybe I have changed. As time passed, I've had fewer grievances about Lungmen, and I've been able to place my trust in more people.

Ch'en:
You are no longer just Inspector Hoshiguma. You are my friend, and my partner.

Ch'en:
Your shield has protected me all this time; so once in a while, you should let me be your shield.

Hoshiguma:
Whew. You're not even going to blush after saying all that?

Ch'en:
Shut the **** up.

Hoshiguma:
Hahaha.

Hoshiguma:
All right, all right. In that case, Ch'en, I'm leaving it to you.
