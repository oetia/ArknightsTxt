Infected:
Thank you... Thank you so much...

Amiya:
It's not safe here. You should hurry and leave.

Infected:
Leave...?

Infected:
Where... would we go?

Infected:
This was a place we could call home... But it's all ruined now...

Amiya:
I'm sorry...

Infected:
It's not your fault...

Infected:
It's not...

Exusiai:
I didn't expect Reunion, the self-proclaimed savior of the Infected, to attack other Infected.

Exusiai:
Now that... is what I call bad publicity.

Texas:
This Reunion infiltration did not just occur spontaneously.

Texas:
I'm sure there were many Infected here who chose to follow Reunion.

Exusiai:
Ugh... They'd rather trust Reunion over Rhodes Island--

Franka:
Rhodes Island does not give empty promises.

Franka:
There are many Infected who are willing to accept whatever Reunion offers, even if it's nothing more than an illusion.

Franka:
There are few who can see through the illusion.

Franka:
And among those who can, most are willing to give up everything just for that vague glimmer of hope.

Franka:
Who would choose to believe our little bunny, who is too kind to deceive others?

Amiya:
...

Misha:
I believe her.

Amiya:
Misha...?

Misha:
Nnh...

Amiya:
Be careful! You can't move around yet!

Misha:
I'm just a bit dizzy... Don't worry.

Misha:
Is Reunion... still chasing us?

Misha:
I don't know what they want from me...

Misha:
But...

Misha:
Let's go...

Misha:
Amiya.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
I understand.

Amiya:
Let's leave right away.

Amiya:
Shortly, we'll be able to exit the slums and meet up with the L.G.D.

Amiya:
Thank you, Misha.

Misha:
No...

Misha:
I... should be thanking you.
