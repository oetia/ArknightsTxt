Ch'en:
It's about time you showed up, Hoshiguma.

Hoshiguma:
Apologies. We were delayed for a long time.

Ch'en:
Any injuries?

Hoshiguma:
No.

Hoshiguma:
However, we were shocked by how strong that Infected was.

Hoshiguma:
The Special Ops Division had already committed a lot of members to reinforcing Lungmen's defense.

Hoshiguma:
I had to take the rest of the available members with me.

Ch'en:
...Was your entire squad really held up by a single enemy?

Hoshiguma:
I didn't believe it either until I saw her with my own eyes.

Hoshiguma:
That person... truly was that strong.

Hoshiguma:
On top of that, she seemed a bit... absent-minded?

Hoshiguma:
Anyway, about these people standing next to you...

Hoshiguma:
Are they Rhodes Island?

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en, is she...

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, an elite from the Special Operations Division.

Hoshiguma:
So you're the Rhodes Island that I've been hearing so much about?

Hoshiguma:
Hmm, such a young kid. Are you also with Rhodes Island?

Ch'en:
She's their leader.

Amiya:
Um, Madam Ch'en...

Hoshiguma:
Woah...

Hoshiguma:
Anyway, let's cut the small talk.

Hoshiguma:
Any ideas about what we do now?

Amiya:
Two of our special agents have located the kidnappers' location.

Amiya:
They're tracking Reunion as we speak, and can provide us with directions.

Hoshiguma:
Not bad.

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, I can see why they've earned your praise.

Hoshiguma:
These people take their work seriously.

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en... praised us?

Ch'en:
Hmph.

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, gather all our squads. It's time to move out.

Ch'en:
Lead the way, Rhodes Island.

Amiya:
Understood. As expected, Reunion left behind some scattered forces.

Amiya:
They'll be lying in ambush on our route...

Hoshiguma:
Not a problem.

Amiya:
Yes, as long as we move cautiously, we'll be able to take the initiative against them.

Hoshiguma:
All right!

Hoshiguma:
Let me see how well you fight, Rhodes Island!
