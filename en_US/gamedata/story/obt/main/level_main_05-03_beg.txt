11:11 A.M Â  Weather/Drizzle

Outside of Muk Wo Warehouse, Sam Cheong Chai, Central Lungmen

Hoshiguma:
The scouting is more or less complete. Our observation spot is stealthy enough, and there's nobody around the warehouse.

Ch'en:
Looks like it's an abandoned construction site with piles of construction materials left behind. There are traces of things being dragged around.

Ch'en:
Reunion must have set up an ambush here.

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, is Phal your informant?

Ch'en:
...Yes. Did you overhear our conversation?

Hoshiguma:
I tried my best not to.

Hoshiguma:
I'e known him for a long time, more than 10 years. There's no way I wouldn't recognize his voice.

Hoshiguma:
When did you make him a informant?

Hoshiguma:
He was infected more than a year ago. At that time, he disappeared from his bar, leaving the glasses he cleaned every day unattended and covered in dust.

Ch'en:
Maybe even before that.

Hoshiguma:
You at least should have told me about it.

Ch'en:
Looks like it's about to rain. Let's get started and chase the enemies out of their ambush spots.

Hoshiguma:
Sigh...

Hoshiguma:
We're too late. He's going to bleed out.

Hoshiguma:
I'll draw Reunion's fire. The rest of you should seize the opportunity to surround them and end this battle quickly.

Ch'en:
Too dangerous.

Hoshiguma:
But it's the fastest way to win. You can trust me on this one.

Ch'en:
I always trust you.

Ch'en:
Follow Hoshiguma's instructions. Make it quick.

L.G.D. Agent:
Yessir!

Ch'en:
I'm ready, Hoshiguma.

Hoshiguma:
That's more like it. I'm going to flush them out of their ambush spots. Give me three minutes.

Ch'en:
Doing all that by yourself in three minutes? That's way too reckless!

Ch'en:
If you show any signs of needing help, we're going to attack.

Hoshiguma:
No, just give me my three minutes.

Ch'en:
...It's all I'm going to need.

Hoshiguma:
Here we go.
