Blaze:
*Pant* *pant*...

Amiya:
Blaze!

Blaze:
I'm fine! They... have some moves.

Blaze:
You're not freezing, are you?

Amiya:
Thanks to you, we're okay. You're keeping the air warm enough to stop her chills.

Blaze:
Don't mention it.

Blaze:
Hey Frosty, why aren't you using lethal Arts?

FrostNova:
*Hack* *cough*...

Blaze:
......

Blaze:
So that's why.

Amiya:
...FrostNova, she...

Blaze:
FrostNova's the name?

FrostNova:
*Hack*... Help me... cover...

Yeti Squad Member:
Sister...

Blaze:
Get out of here, Amiya. There could be more Reunion on the way. Do we have any injured? I can help.

FrostNova:
So you're retreating?

Blaze:
I'm going to politely suggest that you don't fight anymore, snow bunny.

Blaze:
If you keep using your Arts like that, you're going to die. You're just burning your life into power.

Blaze:
Or, you could always come to Rhodes Island. We've got ways to extend your life.

FrostNova:
......

FrostNova:
Don't look at me like that... I don't need your pity.

Blaze:
Do I look like I pity you? You're strong. I respect you.

FrostNova:
......

FrostNova:
Why are you running away?

FrostNova:
*Cough*... *Hack* *hack*...

Blaze:
Dr. {@nickname}, run. Don't look at her!

Meteorite:
Reunion forces closing on our position!

FrostNova:
You're not leaving.

Yeti Squad Member:
Sister, don't use that now, not where you're standing!

FrostNova:
We can't let them escape!

FrostNova:
Who knows what Rhodes Island might do to our people in Lungmen!

FrostNova:
The temperature difference... it's causing the structure... to weaken!

FrostNova:
*Cough* *cough*... freeze!

FrostNova:
......♪......

FrostNova:
*Hack*...!

Yeti Squad Member:
It's working...

Yeti Squad Member:
The Originium we buried has changed the structure of the lower levels, the plates are tilting!

Yeti Squad Member:
Sister, it's too dangerous! Hold onto me!

FrostNova:
......

Yeti Squad Member:
Sister?!

Meteorite:
...Blaze. Do you hear that?

Blaze:
Hm?

Meteorite:
Is that the sound of the structure shattering?

Blaze:
Oh...

Amiya:
Buried Originium... heat absorption... temperature difference...

Amiya:
It's collapsing... FrostNova's Arts can actually do that...?

Blaze:
No!

Blaze:
The plate is warping!

Meteorite:
Reunion is capable of something like this?

Blaze:
All I know is... the whole district is sinking!

Amiya:
Run! Get to a stable area! The ground here is caving in!

Jessica:
...Doctor?

Jessica:
Doctor, the ground under you... it's... splitting?

Blaze:
Uh oh.

Blaze:
Dr. {@nickname}, move!

Amiya:
Doctor!

Blaze:
Amiya, stay where you are! Dr. {@nickname}, grab onto that lamppost!

Amiya:
Save the Doctor!

Blaze:
The ground is splitting too fast! I can't reach!

Amiya:
Then I'll do it!

Blaze:
No!

Amiya:
What did——

Amiya:
Doctor!!

Meteorite:
The buildings can't support their own weight anymore, they're all collapsing!

Blaze:
Meteorite, take her!

Meteorite:
Okay, I've got Amiya!

Amiya:
Put me down!

Blaze:
Amiya, go. I'll get the Doctor! I'm an elite operator, I can do it!

Amiya:
......

Blaze:
Welp, looks like we're not quite done.

Blaze:
Doctor, I'm going to use airflow and pressure to slow your fall and push away the building beside you. Don't worry, it won't crush you!

Blaze:
Just don't panic! I've got you!

Blaze:
...See you soon!

Blaze:
......

Yeti Squad Member:
......

Blaze:
Sup? Where's FrostNova?

Blaze:
Your commander fell down there too, huh?

Yeti Squad Member:
...Yes.

Yeti Squad Member:
Could we not fight?

Yeti Squad Member:
Rabbit of Rhodes Island, could we forge a temporary armistice? Honestly, we never much wanted to fight you.

Amiya:
But...

Yeti Squad Member:
Mephisto told our sister you'd killed Alex, and she was very concerned about what you would do next.

Amiya:
...Who's Alex?

Yeti Squad Member:
Skullshatterer.

Amiya:
I'm sorry. I did kill Skullshatterer.

Yeti Squad Member:
...Oh.

Amiya:
Infected really should not fight one another. I'm sorry.

Yeti Squad Member:
What's to apologize for? It was a battle, wasn't it?

Amiya:
It was.

Yeti Squad Member:
So let's have a ceasefire. Nesti, what do you say?

Yeti Squad Member:
Huh? *Ursine profanity*!

Yeti Squad Member:
Nesti says he's fine with it.

Frostleaf:
I don't think that's what he said.

Yeti Squad Member:
As long as we're not in battle, there's no reason to kill anyone, right?

Amiya:
Why is it... you want a ceasefire?

Yeti Squad Member:
Did you ever notice that both our sides are led by rabbits?

Blaze:
...Huh?

Frostleaf:
I think something in my brain just broke.

Jessica:
Hm?

Frostleaf:
These are the yetis of the ice field?

Jessica:
Wh- what do you mean?

Frostleaf:
Shouldn't they be cold, merciless killers?

Frostleaf:
This isn't right.

Yeti Squad Member:
That's prejudiced.

Yeti Squad Member:
Listen here, bunny.

Yeti Squad Member:
Who wins the battle, or where you go, none of that matters to us. All we care about is our sister's life.

Yeti Squad Member:
And you're worried about your friend too, right?

Amiya:
...Right. We didn't come here to hurt anyone.

Yeti Squad Member:
You're definitely not here to hunt Reunion for sport, are you?

Amiya:
Of course not!

Yeti Squad Member:
You know... it's funny...

Yeti Squad Member:
If it weren't for Patriot insisting on unity in the Reunion Movement, we'd have dealt with Mephisto and his people a long time ago.

Yeti Squad Member:
And that'd be kinda like hunting Reunion for sport, huh?

Amiya:
Huh...

Yeti Squad Member:
Let's get digging, shall we?
