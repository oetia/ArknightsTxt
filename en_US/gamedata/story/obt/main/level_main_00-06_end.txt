Dobermann:
Ugh... Gahh...

Dobermann:
Those sick bastards! I can't believe they, they...

Guard:
Those beasts...

Guard:
Were they Reunion's doing...?

Amiya:
Reunion enslaved infected beasts to use as troops...

Dobermann:
No, it's not that simple.

Dobermann:
I can feel it, they...

Dobermann:
Are no mere beasts. In fact, they're more like us...

Guard:
Instructor Dobermann...

Dobermann:
...

Guard:
Boss... What should we do?

Ace:
Give them a merciful end.

Guard:
Boss...

Ace:
Dobermann, the battle is over.

Ace:
We also had to face off against Reunion forces.

Ace:
The Catastrophe is already looming over us. It's likely to break at any moment.

Ace:
Even Chernobog will be reduced to rubble under its direct impact.

Amiya:
Reunion is taking advantage of this to sow even more chaos.

Ace:
Dobermann, we're out of time.

Ace:
We might be able to outmaneuver Reunion or stay concealed from Ursus, but we're powerless in the face of a Catastrophe.

Dobermann:
...

Dobermann:
That's enough. Let's go.

Dobermann:
No matter how reckless Reunion's plans are, the most important thing for us...

Amiya:
...is everyone's safety.

Dobermann:
That's right.

Amiya:
Reunion's leaders may see this event as a sign, or even as a means...

Amiya:
But for me, it signifies that we will be in greater danger from now on.

Ace:
Choosing a time like this to incite chaos...

Ace:
Reunion is either insane, or just evil.

Dobermann:
Perhaps, a bit of both.
