Ch'en:
Hope I didn't keep you waiting. The L.G.D. meeting took a little longer than expected.

Amiya:
Don't worry about it, Madam Ch'en.

Amiya:
(She looks like nothing ever happened...)

Ch'en:
How's the situation?

Amiya:
Our scout team has already sent back some information.

Amiya:
I went through it and picked out a few things that might interest you.

Amiya:
Ah, Inspector Hoshiguma...

Hoshiguma:
Don't worry about me. I'm just going to listen in.

Ch'en:
Continue, Amiya. It's fine.

Amiya:
Very well. We managed to get a lead from some Infected...

Amiya:
The scout team has already confirmed that there are several Reunion hideouts in Lungmen's residential district.

Ch'en:
And?

Amiya:
A number of Reunion squads are already planning to launch an attack against Lungmen's defenses.

Amiya:
We even found an infiltration channel that Reunion had been using.

Ch'en:
Hah. Such arrogance.

Ch'en:
They seem to be underestimating the L.G.D.

Ch'en:
What about the ruins of Chernobog?

Amiya:
Rhodes Island dispatched multiple recon squads there.

Amiya:
While most of the residents were gone, we did find many Reunion members still active there.

Amiya:
One team even had more than three encounters with Reunion forces.

Amiya:
However, based upon the intel we have, we are unable to conclusively link the movements in the city to any broader Reunion operations...

Amiya:
But I would recommend choosing this city as one of our important operation targets in the future.

Ch'en:
...I see.

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, help bring me my forms. Third drawer on the left side of my desk.

Hoshiguma:
Right now? Sure thing.

Ch'en:
Continue.

Amiya:
Mm, to summarize...

Amiya:
Rhodes Island suggests a joint operation to completely eliminate the remaining Reunion forces in Lungmen.

Ch'en:
No good.

Ch'en:
The L.G.D. will not permit it.

Amiya:
...What? Madam Ch'en...?

Ch'en:
I said, no.

Ch'en:
You... are an Infected.

Ch'en:
If you carry out any more missions in the slums, you'll only cause greater disorder.

Amiya:
...

Ch'en:
This is our decision.

Amiya:
But--

Amiya:
Ah, excuse me, I need to take this call...

Amiya:
This is Amiya.

???:
Is, is this Amiya?

Amiya:
...! Jessica?

Jessica:
Yes, Jessica here...

Amiya:
Are you on a stealth mission? I can barely hear you...

Jessica:
We found them in the city ruins...

Jessica:
Reunion's leaders...

Jessica:
There are... two of them.

Amiya:
What?!

Mephisto:
So, you fled back here with your tail between your legs?

W:
I am no mongrel like you and your lowly kind.

Mephisto:
...If not for the fact that you completed your mission, I would have added two more scars to your filthy face.

W:
Didn't you lose all your limbs in that explosion? I'd feel sorry making a kid like you put makeup on my face with your mouth.

Mephisto:
Pah.

W:
But let's set this aside for now... It's not doing either of us any good.

Mephisto:
I'll admit to that much.

Mephisto:
Then, have they taken the bait?

W:
Surely. Let's just see if that old flag-waver can bring back the real goods.

W:
Speaking of which, you're pretty scared of that old timer, aren't you?

Mephisto:
I'm already in a bad mood.

W:
Oh my, sorry 'bout that.

W:
But that's just before we land the catch, right?

W:
How about we put aside our differences for the time being?

Mephisto:
Tch. Fine.

Mephisto:
I'll deal with the small fry first.

Mephisto:
Rhodes Island, I know you're there.

Mephisto:
...It's impossible to hide from me.

Meteorite:
Jessica, don't!

Meteorite:
It could be a trap...!

Jessica:
He found us! We have to...

Jessica:
If we defeat the enemy leader... We have to...!

Mephisto:
Huh. They really were here.

Mephisto:
Where'd you come from, little kitty~?

Mephisto:
You can't just treat this place like your playground.

Mephisto:
Hey, you bunch.

Reunion Member:
Yessir!!

Mephisto:
Before we get to feast upon the most sumptuous prey...

Mephisto:
Help yourself to the appetizers.

Reunion Member:
Ohhh... Ohhhhh! !

Frostleaf:
Tsk...!
