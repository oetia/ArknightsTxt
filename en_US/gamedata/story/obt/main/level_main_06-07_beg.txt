9:00 A.M. / Overcast

14 hours before the attack on L. G. D. Headquarters

'Bad Guy' - 300 Meters above 'District 14' of Chernobog

Mission objective: Join forces with Rhodes Island to rescue the reconnaissance team

Assigned assets:

'Bad Guy' and its pilot; Rhodes Island elite operator Blaze and her team.

14 individuals.

Pilot:
This is your stop. Amiya and her people are nearby!

Pilot:
Was it really okay to drop the team outside the city? You're gonna go down there by yourself?!

???:
Come on, it's a lot better for them to be out there clearing a path and pushing back Reunion's pursuit forces than to fight here.

Pilot:
Okay. The terrain down there is pretty rough. This is as far as I can take you.

???:
It's fine.

Pilot:
...At least let me put down a rope for you?

???:
When have you ever seen me use a rope?

Pilot:
You're just gonna go for it again, huh?

???:
Go for what? What are you talking about?

Pilot:
Every time we have a mission together, you go off and do crazy stuff while I sit in the cockpit on pins and needles and watch.

Pilot:
I'm kind of used to it, but that doesn't change the fact that you're way too reckless out there.

???:
That just goes to show you what a good rapport you, me, and my team have!

Pilot:
Rapport my ass! Last time you demolished a town, bombed out a reservoir, and collapsed a mine!

Pilot:
Keep the chaos on the ground please, don't bring it onto my baby!

???:
Fine, fine. I got it. But, 'Bad Guy,' really? Maybe think a little harder next time you pick a name.

Pilot:
Just jump already.

Pilot:
I think the welcoming committee's spotted us. This is where we say goodbye, Blaze.

Blaze:
No problem.

Pilot:
I'll wait for you by the entrance to the ruins. Be quick!

Pilot:
Huh? The comms.

???:
HELLO?!

Pilot:
I can hear you! You don't have to yell!

???:
Oh. Hi, Rhodes Islanders. I'm with the L. G. D. I've met up with your team by the ruins!

Blaze:
Didn't the L. G. D. withdraw already? What are you trying to pull?

???:
I'm not like that Ch'en lady! Trust me, I can help you.

Pilot:
And how should we call you?

???:
Use my codename. Call me Officer Swire!

Pilot:
......

Pilot:
Isn't Swire just your name?

Pilot:
Blaze, can you take care of this? I'm not good with bureaucrats...

Pilot:
......Blaze?

Blaze:
Don't look at me.

Pilot:
Get back here! Don't jump!

Blaze:
Didn't you tell me to jump a second ago? You can handle this. I believe in you! *Mwah*

Pilot:
Mwah my ass!

Frostleaf:
*Pant* *pant*...

Meteorite:
...Is she okay?

Amiya:
Yes, it's nothing serious. Just her body temperature's a little low.

Frostleaf:
It's always... low. I'm fine. I just...

Amiya:
Frostleaf, slow down. Your temperature is even lower than usual.

Amiya:
Doctor, pass me a bandage.

Frostleaf:
I told you, I'm fine. Meteorite got hit a lot harder.

Meteorite:
It's okay. I'm a Sarkaz. I'm more worried about you.

Amiya:
Jessica, what is Yeti Squad doing?

Jessica:
Th- they're approaching our position! About 500 meters out!

Amiya:
And the debris clearing?

Rhodes Island Operator:
We need about fifteen more minutes. The collapsed building has a pretty complicated superstructure and we can't risk blasting here.

Amiya:
Meteorite, get ready to fight. We have to hold this line.

Meteorite:
Roger. Do we have a stock of bolts?

Amiya:
Yes. Logistics can get them for you...

???:
Amiya, are you there?

Amiya:
......

Jessica:
......

Rhodes Island Operator:
...guh.

Amiya:
Did somebody leave their comms open?

???:
This is the elite operators' channel, I can open it from my end.

Jessica:
That voice...?

Frostleaf:
Oh no. They sent her.

Jessica:
Um... who is it?

Frostleaf:
They call her Blaze. She can certainly level the whole area and leave everyone pissing themselves.

Blaze:
Damn right it's me! But that last part is a little off.

Amiya:
Please... let's be serious here.

Amiya:
Where are you, Blaze? We need your support.

Blaze:
I'm right above you.

Amiya:
What?

Blaze:
Just about 200 meters to go and I'll be there!

Yeti Squad Member:
I can't hit the machine, it's out of range!

Yeti Squad Member:
Flying machines... they have such equipment?

FrostNova:
Make sure they do not come down.

FrostNova:
Wipe out the Rhodes Island squad before their reinforcements arrive. They cannot be allowed to join forces.

FrostNova:
Wait.

FrostNova:
———Stand back!

Meteorite:
She jumped again?

Frostleaf:
She jumped again.

Amiya:
......

Blaze:
We can jump together sometime, Amiya! If you want.

Amiya:
I think I'll take a rain check. Where's your team?

Blaze:
I left them outside the city. They'll be here in a bit.

Amiya:
I can't hear anything over the wind. Turn off your comms!

Amiya:
Everyone... move to support Blaze.

Amiya:
Dr. {@nickname}, no matter what she says...

Amiya:
...just nod.

Yeti Squad Member:
It dropped something...

Yeti Squad Member:
...a person?

FrostNova:
There's only one. But keep your guard up.

FrostNova:
I sense a heat. She's using some kind of temperature Arts.

Blaze:
Hello, Reunion friends.

Blaze:
I don't like fighting other Infected. But I heard you hurt some of my Rhodes Island co-workers...

Blaze:
And you're still after my buddies. So I'm going to have to put a stop to that.

FrostNova:
Aren't you mouthy...

Blaze:
Hi. How you doing, Miss Frosty?

Blaze:
I wanna see what happens when my hot meets your cold.
