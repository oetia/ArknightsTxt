Hoshiguma:
That was easier than I expected. Really makes me more and more curious as to what happened in Chernobog.

Ch'en:
Perhaps it's the same thing as what happened here, except the roots sank in deeper and the flames burned with more intensity. Don't let your guard down.

Hoshiguma:
You should know that I rarely close my eyes when I'm sleeping.

Hoshiguma:
Ugh. I was trying to end the fighting as soon as possible, but we still ended up damaging so many shops.

Hoshiguma:
I'm afraid Mister Wei is going to end up footing the bill again, especially because he's not fond of the li'l Miss's family in the first place.

Hoshiguma:
Hey, it's Swarovski Crystal. Ch'en, isn't this your favorite brand?

Ch'en:
Not really. The pendants are nice, but the earrings aren't that good.

Ch'en:
Squad B1, Ch'en here. Block the west entrance and lower all the security gates.

Hoshiguma:
I rarely see you wear earrings.

Ch'en:
Well, I'm usually in uniform because of work. The few outfits I do have are gathering cobwebs in my wardrobe.

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Hoshiguma! This is the L3 floor plan of East Paci Plaza after Reunion modified it. Please look over it!

Hoshiguma:
Good job. Continue with the investigation, and try to utilize the terrain to our advantage.

Hoshiguma:
Afterwards, we'll find the best route to cross Reunion's blockade from here. We can't make do without your information.

L.G.D. Agent:
Roger!

Hoshiguma:
Clothes, huh... It's hard picturing you as someone who spends money on that kind of stuff.

Ch'en:
Aren't you the same way with your countless motorbikes? What's wrong with wanting to look nice for yourself every now and then?

Ch'en:
Work takes up most of my time, but it's not my whole life after all.

Hoshiguma:
I'd be more likely to believe you if you didn't show up early every morning like clockwork, as well as taking on overtime hours that would scare anyone else to death.

Hoshiguma:
I guess all you can say is that life is tolerable for cops like us.

Hoshiguma:
Sometimes I ask myself, for those Infected like Amiya... Will they have a chance to go out shopping? Maybe to buy some accessories they like, or eat some of their favorite food?

Ch'en:
Perhaps one day. But that day is not here yet.

Ch'en:
C3, Ch'en here. Clear the first floor and push forward slowly. Safety first.

Hoshiguma:
I guess so. This patch of dirt truly is unfair. Phal died, but I get to live on.

Hoshiguma:
They all died, and only I got to live.

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en. Is that intel really worthwhile?

Ch'en:
It has to be.

Reunion Caster:
(B-bastards...)

Reunion Caster:
(At least I'll bury you with me...!)

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en! Run!! We've found a large number of explosives on the third floor!

L.G.D. Agent:
Right under where you're standing!!

Reunion Caster:
L.G.D., prepare to meet your makers!

Ch'en:
...!

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en! Over here! Get behind my shield!!

Ch'en:
Huh?

Ch'en:
Under me?

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en!!
