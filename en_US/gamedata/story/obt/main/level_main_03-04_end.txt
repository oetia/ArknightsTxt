Liskarm:
What the hell...

Liskarm:
All that, for only a single Reunion squad...

Franka:
And a really big guy.

Franka:
Now that was the highlight. I'm totally exhausted just from dealing with him!

Hoshiguma:
Impossible.

Hoshiguma:
How could so many Infected vanish so quickly?

Hoshiguma:
Was that giant guy just a diversion?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Did Reunion manage to completely evacuate this area in such a short period of time?

Amiya:
No... Madam Ch'en should have blocked off their escape route...

Franka:
I'm not seeing the designated waypoint.

Franka:
Something... isn't right about this.

Franka:
Weeds, ruins, sand dunes...

Franka:
All of which are potential spots for an ambush...

Franka:
But, I'm not seeing anything.

Franka:
No footsteps, no sounds of clothing brushing against plants, no smell of explosives...

Franka:
I can't tell what's going on!

Franka:
Penguin Logistics, wake up and do your job!

Franka:
This isn't right at all!

Hoshiguma:
Hush!

Hoshiguma:
What's that sound...?

Exusiai:
... ... ... Huh?

Exusiai:
It's from... underground?!!

Exusiai:
Amiya! The noise is coming from underground!

Amiya:
!!!!

Hoshiguma:
Doctor!! Get down, now!!!

Hoshiguma:
These guys... will really stop at nothing!

Skullshatterer:
...?!

Skullshatterer:
How... did you block that?

Hoshiguma:
My 'Hannya' is not something you can penetrate.

Skullshatterer:
We'll see... about that...

Franka:
...!

Franka:
The temperature is rising sharply! !

Franka:
Is he trying to detonate his staff?

Franka:
Doctor! Run away! At that distance, you'll--

Hoshiguma:
You'll---

Skullshatterer:
It's over!

Amiya:
No... Noooo---!

Amiya:
You can't-----

Amiya:
I won't let you hurt Doctor------! !

Amiya:
...!

Skullshatterer:
*cough* *cough*...

Amiya:
...!

Skullshatterer:
You are powerful...

Skullshatterer:
But... look at you...

Skullshatterer:
You're so strong.

Skullshatterer:
*cough*... It hurts...

Skullshatterer:
Even though you have this kind of power...

Skullshatterer:
You still... in cold blood... watch your fellow Infected...

Skullshatterer:
I can't... forgive...

Skullshatterer:
I can't forgive those like you...

Skullshatterer:
Ugh...

Misha:
... ...

Misha:
No... Don't...!
