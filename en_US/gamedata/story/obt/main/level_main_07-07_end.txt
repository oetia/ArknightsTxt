Chernobog Warehouse 12:40 A.M.

Amiya:
With all these warehouses and storage equipment... this must be the warehouse district.

Amiya:
If we stay on this path, we'll reach the central district.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Amiya! Come look! In the warehouse.

Amiya:
What is it? ...Oh.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Signs of combat using sharp, blade-type Arts. Made quick work of three Reunion guys, tossed them over here.

Amiya:
...still going.

Amiya:
Dr. Kal'tsit!

Amiya:
Um, I'm asking you and the medic operators to take care of the Reunion people. They may have important information.

Amiya:
And we've picked up Madame Ch'en's trail here...

Amiya:
Bloodstains. She's hurt.

Amiya:
There's a trail of blood here, but it stops over there. She got her bleeding under control.

Amiya:
Only one person left the scene. It must be Madame Ch'en.

Amiya:
...Hold on, Madame Ch'en. We're coming...

Amiya:
Hah... Yeah, Chernobog was just like this.

Amiya:
But Madame Ch'en was able to take on a rogue Reunion team all by herself back there...

Amiya:
This time, it's totally different.

Amiya:
We had a cooperation agreement then, nothing else. I was only starting to learn who Madame Ch'en was...

Amiya:
But here, we're already...

Amiya:
Is that... a civilian?

Rhodes Island Operator:
...Where did she come from? We haven't found their hideout...

???:
This is an Ursus graveyard!

Amiya:
!

Amiya:
(Stay alert... but hold your fire!)

Amiya:
We're a neutral group researching the Infected! Ma'am,  we're here to help you!

Amiya:
We mean you no harm, you're a regular Infected—

???:
Infected? Pfah! I'm Ursus!

Ursus Infected:
You want to help the Infected...?! Hah, bullshit... Don't you know what you Infected have done to us?

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
Ma'am, we'll keep our distance if you feel unsafe. We'll stay twenty meters back.

Ursus Infected:
No, no, I'm Infected too. So I'm not supposed to talk to you like that, right?

Ursus Infected:
You'll save the Infected? Ahaha, hahaha... All Infected should all just die!

Ursus Infected:
I should die too. I should die too! If there were no Infected, I wouldn't have gotten Infected!

Ursus Infected:
All they think about is revenge and hurting others... Is THAT what the Infected do? Is that what I should be doing?!

Rosmontis:
......

Rosmontis:
(Amiya, comfort her, okay?)

Amiya:
(No. Not now.)

Amiya:
(Let her vent. All the painful memories she's built up over the last month are stabbing into her consciousness.)

Amiya:
(It's time she... faces them. This is a chance for her to pull them all out.)

Ursus Infected:
......

Ursus Infected:
Do you know who we are here, Infected?

Ursus Infected:
Infected, just like you. Alive and dead.

Ursus Infected:
The Infected who managed to just barely keep themselves alive, thanks to Reunion; and the countless Infected who died here, thanks to Reunion...

Ursus Infected:
But we weren't Infected before.

Ursus Infected:
They scattered the people of Chernobog in all directions, then hunted us down. It started as a slaughter, then turned to torture, and finally they dumped the survivors like trash!

Ursus Infected:
I don't even know how many starved or froze to death...

Ursus Infected:
But those of us who survived were all Infected by constant exposure to Originium! Every last one of us!

Ursus Infected:
You Infected...

Ursus Infected:
You damn Infected...!!

Amiya:
Trust us... You don't have to take us to the other patients. We'll leave you what you need for critical care. And then we're gone.

Ursus Infected:
......

Ursus Infected:
I don't trust you.

Ursus Infected:
Did Ursus send you? Or Lungmen?

???:
If it really was them, we'd be dead already.

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
It's you...!

Kal'tsit:
Amiya, scan his ID code.

Amiya:
Dr. Kal'tsit...?!

???:
......

Kal'tsit:
Guard, explain yourself.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
It's been a while, Amiya, Dr. Kal'tsit.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
And, Dr. {@nickname}.
