Amiya:
...It's getting darker and darker.

Amiya:
It's as if the clouds are pressing into the skyline...

Amiya:
The air still feels clear, but the dark clouds aren't moving. It feels like all the stress is being compressed into a single point.

Amiya:
Even the wind has stopped...

Dobermann:
No doubt about it. A Catastrophe is about to befall this city.

Dobermann:
By the looks of things, Chernobog has been completely paralyzed by Reunion's attacks.

Dobermann:
But when it comes to disabling a mobile city, the preparations must have been made several weeks in advance.

Dobermann:
Could Reunion have taken some other action since then...?

Ace:
That's a bit unrealistic.

Ace:
Based upon what we've seen, Reunion currently doesn't show the kind of discipline required to stage a covert takeover.

Guard:
Most Reunion members are still wandering the streets, taking revenge on Chernobogians.

Amiya:
It's all just senseless fighting, killing, and arson.

Dobermann:
When the Catastrophe falls, even the impregnable Chernobog will be shattered...

Dobermann:
...and turn into Originium-filled ruins.

Dobermann:
If fame or fortune is what they're after, Reunion is doomed to failure.

Amiya:
Even with Ursus's chain of command in shambles, I still doubt that Reunion is able to face their military...

Amiya:
Why hasn't the Ursus military staged a counterattack yet?

Dobermann:
From my experience, when a riot breaks out, the military usually manages to quash it immediately.

Dobermann:
But we did just witness the Ursus guards getting overpowered...

Amiya:
...

Dobermann:
That masked Reunion leader might have been a cut above the rest... but there's no way she could single-handedly destroy the entire city.

Dobermann:
Unless...

Amiya:
Unless what?

Dobermann:
I've fought in many battles before...

Dobermann:
I've seen many people who acted in the same way as that Reunion leader.

Dobermann:
To them, soldiers are nothing more than pawns to be tossed away as soon as they've served their purpose.

Dobermann:
Soldiers could be used efficiently when needed, and then left to their own devices when not needed.

Dobermann:
Because the cost of training and maintenance is too high.

Ace:
So, there's no standing army?

Dobermann:
Right. Most of the time, they simply have to be fed with some hatred or fear...

Dobermann:
All that's needed to whip them into a frenzy... is a little push.

Dobermann:
If the way that Reunion leader acted was any indication for how the organization is run...

Guard:
Ugh...

Guard:
Any Infected could join Reunion simply by donning a uniform and putting on a badge?

Dobermann:
Correct..

Dobermann:
So... that explains their endless numbers.

Dobermann:
There are too many oppressed Infected, desperately trying to cry out. No matter how tenuous the solutions that Reunion offers them might be...

Dobermann:
As long as they see a light at the end of the tunnel, they will gladly lay their lives down to pursue it, even if it means jumping into a sea of hellfire.

Medic:
Ugh...

Dobermann:
Dr. {@nickname}.

Dobermann:
They are not like us. Even if I don't fully trust you, I at least trust your abilities.

Dobermann:
And completely unlike you...

Dobermann:
That kind of leader is no commander.

Dobermann:
Those who would trample enemies and comrades alive... or rather, 'minions.'

Dobermann:
Perhaps not even minions. To Reunion, those thugs may have been nothing more than pawns.

Dobermann:
This is not a leader, but a tyrant.

Ace:
No matter who our enemies are, we will complete our mission.

Ace:
Someone once taught me and my teammates--

Ace:
'If facing a pawn, capture it; If facing a fortress, topple it; If facing the Crown, overthrow it.'

Dobermann:
Ace, wait a minute.

Ace:
Dr. {@nickname}, enemy light-armored troops are stationed in front of us.

Amiya:
Have we been found?

Ace:
Not yet.

Dobermann:
However...

Ace:
We won't be able to avoid them. The route we're on is the shortest one; if we take a detour, we'll lose time we don't have.

Dobermann:
No need for further discussion then. Thugs or pawns, all that matters is that we clear them out of our way!
