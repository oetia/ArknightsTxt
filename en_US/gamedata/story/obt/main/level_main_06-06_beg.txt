Amiya:
GreyThroat! What's your position?

GreyThroat:
Amiya, I am providing support to an L. G. D. team.

Amiya:
We're about to engage!

Amiya:
Attention all elite operators: this may be our first, last, and only large-scale battle in Lungmen.

Amiya:
Everyone take objective one as your primary mission.

Amiya:
My team and I will be focusing on engaging the enemy commander.

Amiya:
I want you all to remember: top priority is completing the terms of our contract, that is to work with the L. G. D. to ensure the security of Lungmen.

Amiya:
But Rhodes Island's mission in this battle is to reduce the friction between the Infected and uninfected people, to prevent clashes!

Amiya:
We are Rhodes Island! No matter what else we carry into battle!

Amiya:
No matter when, no matter where!

Amiya:
And of course, if at any point our operations fall outside our standards, we will put a stop to them at once!

Amiya:
As such, we go into battle with a heavy burden of responsibility on our shoulders.

Blaze:
That was for my sake, huh?

Blaze:
She's such a worrywart...

Blaze:
You saw what tough customers those Infected were back there. That's a lot for one operator, or even one team to handle.

Blaze:
I really should've put that kid to bed once and for all back on the rooftop.

Blaze:
Oh, copy.

Amiya:
If you don't get your butt to the ambush point, I'll take all of last year's disciplinary reports and hand them over to Dr. Kal'tsit!

Blaze:
......

Blaze:
Settle down! I'll be there right on time!

Amiya:
Blaze!

Blaze:
What am I supposed to do? We have to hurry...

Blaze:
(You'll pay for that one!)

Amiya:
Why so quiet, Doctor?

Amiya:
......Blaze!

Blaze:
I didn't do anything! It's the Doctor who clammed up!

Blaze:
Tell her already!

Blaze:
Come on, say something...!

Amiya:
Huh...?

Amiya:
Sorry, Doctor. I forgot you and Blaze would definitely go at it like this...

Blaze:
I do what I gotta do.

Amiya:
Why are you so pleased with yourself?

Amiya:
Anyway, all I need is your location and current operation.

Amiya:
You two seem to be getting along.

Blaze:
Sure are!

Amiya:
...Really?

Blaze:
......

Blaze:
(Wait, what's happening here? What should I tell her?)

Blaze:
(This is bad! Red alert! I'm taking psychic damage! I need guidance!)

Amiya:
Keep at it.

Blaze:
She hung up!

Blaze:
Oh no. We're in trouble.

Blaze:
But at least we're here. Let's take a load off.

Blaze:
Well... shit.

Blaze:
You know what they say, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Let's hop down.

Blaze:
Yep. Yawn.

Blaze:
Hold on... If I'm not mistaken... That's Mephisto's team over there to the east, moving to the ambush zone.

Blaze:
And over there... the scaly kid?

Blaze:
He's taking his team to fight something. What is all that black there?

Blaze:
Is that the herd...? With those numbers?!

Blaze:
Looks like we can't rest here, Doctor. Let's go. Time for the final battle!

Blaze:
Hey, Amiya. Hey!

Blaze:
I'm taking the Doctor into the fight!

Swire:
What are you thinking?

Ch'en:
......

Ch'en:
We let a small Reunion group go, then we track them into the slums.

Swire:
Weren't you leaving that to the special forces?

Ch'en:
No reason we can't take the opportunity.

Ch'en:
I've already looked into the situation once and one thing is clear: as long as we're there, the special forces can't act openly.

Ch'en:
Once the fighting stops, they won't be able to do much.

Swire:
You're not worried about orders from the top?

Ch'en:
Who's going to stand up and take responsibility for the team?

Swire:
All right, so you've got it all figured out. What's going on in the slums?

Ch'en:
My informants have been busy. There's a few sectors I haven't been able to contact, but we have a lot more intelligence than anyone else.

Swire:
This is a big gamble. But I guess we have no choice.

Ch'en:
The L. G. D. is the only group that can face down the special forces.

Ch'en:
Amiya, do you copy?

Amiya:
Officer Ch'en, we're in position!

Ch'en:
...Mmhm.

Ch'en:
I need to apologize for the whole ordeal with Reunion scooping up the Infected. That wouldn't have happened if we'd been more thoughtful.

Amiya:
...It's thanks to the L. G. D.'s quick action in the slums that Lungmen is able to plan against Reunion.

Amiya:
On a strategic level, I think you're fine, Officer Ch'en. But personally...

Amiya:
Officer Ch'en, Misha is dead.

Ch'en:
......

Amiya:
And I can't condone your opinions of the Infected. Even you know...

Amiya:
The Lungmenites who love their city will fight for her, no matter who they are.

Swire:
Wow, what an awesome little bunny.

Amiya:
Did I just hear Miss Swire?

Ch'en:
Don't mind her.

Swire:
Hey!

Ch'en:
I agree with you, Amiya. Fighting for Lungmen can unite the people... except those tied up with Reunion.

Ch'en:
But actually living in Lungmen is another matter. Time can't solve everything.

Amiya:
Of course. We have to solve everything ourselves.

Ch'en:
Wishful thinking. The Infected and uninfected live in different worlds.

Amiya:
It's not wishful thinking, Officer Ch'en. It's thinking about Misha, and the countless other Infected who died just like her.

Amiya:
It was the gap between those two worlds that killed them. Are we going to let that divide define us? Are we not going to fight to bridge it?

Ch'en:
......

Amiya:
I hope you can understand, Officer Ch'en, why it is that the Infected and uninfected of Rhodes Island come together to fight for Lungmen.

Amiya:
They're here, Officer Ch'en.

Ch'en:
Prepare for battle.

Phantom Crossbowman:
It's an ambush! The L. G. D. is pushing us in!

Faust:
Push through to the slums. Even though we haven't heard from Crownslayer... the slums are our only way out.

Faust:
Take him.

Phantom Crossbowman:
What are you going to do?

Faust:
Me and a few teams have encouraged the 'herd' to gather up here.

Faust:
They won't attack me, so I can fight alongside them.

L. G. D. Officer:
Fire in the hole!

Reunion Member:
We can't hold for long!

Herd:
Ugh... Guhhh!!

L. G. D. Officer:
It's those special Infected! Look out!

Phantom Crossbowman:
You'll bring up the rear?

Phantom Crossbowman:
You're not coming back.

Faust:
......

Mephisto:
Mmm! Mmhhh!!

Phantom Crossbowman:
......

Faust:
Let him speak. He can't do his Arts like this.

Mephisto:
What are you doing?!

Faust:
Mephisto...

Mephisto:
What are you doing?! You can't do this! Come back! Please! Come back here!

Faust:
You once told me you would do anything I asked you.

Mephisto:
Sasha!

Faust:
You said you don't want to make decisions for yourself.

Faust:
It's just, if you have your own ideas and your own goals now... I can't blame you for your choices.

Faust:
If that's the way it is, Mephisto... Well, that's great.

Faust:
But...

Faust:
I'm out of options.

Faust:
So let me tell you my last wish.

Mephisto:
Sasha...? What are you talking about? I don't understand!

L. G. D. Officer:
Don't let them escape! Take out their commanders!

GreyThroat:
Ah...!

Faust:
...The Rhodes Island swallow?

Faust:
(Mouthing 'pull the trigger.')

L. G. D. Officer:
Hit the deck! Watch the crossfire! We've got them surrounded!

GreyThroat:
——!

L. G. D. Officer:
Fall back, Rhodes Island crossbowman! This corridor is ours!

Phantom Crossbowman:
Faust! Run!

Faust:
No.

Faust:
Crossbowmen, I know FrostNova is on her way. And even though Crownslayer is missing, her people are out there in the slums somewhere.

Faust:
When FrostNova gets here, you're under her command.

Faust:
I trust her. Once she arrives, you'll be okay.

Faust:
And with my Originium Arts, you'll be invisible.

Phantom Crossbowman:
You can't, Faust! That will rupture your organs!

Faust:
Doesn't matter. There's no reason not to do it anymore.

Faust:
Retreat. That's an order.

Faust:
And take him with you. But not to Chernobog.

Phantom Crossbowman:
...Faust...

Mephisto:
You can't do this!

Faust:
......

Faust:
I hope you survive. Even on your own.

Faust:
Don't die.

Faust:
——That's my last wish.

Mephisto:
Sasha! Sashaaaaa!!!

Faust:
I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't want to get anyone hurt.

Faust:
I wish we had just run away, back then.

Faust:
We could have... just run away.

Mephisto:
Sasha, you promised! We promised each other! We swore we would survive together!

Faust:
It's too late... for me...

Faust:
...I'm too tired.

Mephisto:
Sashaaaaaa!!!

Faust:
Goodbye, Eno.

He nocks a bolt into his crossbow, and winds it.

He takes aim, for the last time.
