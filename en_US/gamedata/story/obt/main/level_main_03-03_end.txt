Skullshatterer:
Look.

Misha:
Hmm...

Skullshatterer:
This is the trigger.

Skullshatterer:
Just load the ammo like this...

Skullshatterer:
Aim at the enemy, and pull the trigger.

Skullshatterer:
This will launch the bullet...

Skullshatterer:
Then concentrate, and grip the handle.

Skullshatterer:
Concentrate... and channel your Arts.

Skullshatterer:
This will cause the bullet to detonate.

Misha:
I don't know if I can...

Skullshatterer:
I know you can do this.

Skullshatterer:
We have a lot in common. I can feel it within you.

Skullshatterer:
Just picture it in your mind...

Skullshatterer:
Here, hold on to this Originium shard.

Misha:
Nnh...

Skullshatterer:
Concentrate.

Misha:
...

Misha:
My palm feels... hot.

Skullshatterer:
That's right!

Skullshatterer:
I knew it, I knew it...

Skullshatterer:
Yes, Misha, you really are... Haha, ahaha...

Skullshatterer:
You really are my...

Reunion Member:
...We have to go! Skullshatterer, hurry!

Reunion Member:
We can't hold this base anymore!

Skullshatterer:
What happened?!

Reunion Member:
Rhodes Island is attacking! We're being rushed!

Skullshatterer:
...

Skullshatterer:
Those bastards...

Skullshatterer:
Don't panic. Regroup and prepare our counterattack!

Misha:
Skullshatterer...

Misha:
I'm sure... Rhodes Island will...

Skullshatterer:
Will what? You want me to have a chat with Rhodes Island?

Misha:
They, they're surely trying to help the Infected.

Skullshatterer:
They killed so many of my comrades...

Skullshatterer:
You're really asking me to talk to them?

Skullshatterer:
All my comrades... they were Infected too!

Skullshatterer:
Rhodes Island, those self-proclaimed saviors of the Infected... what did they do to help my comrades?

Skullshatterer:
What did they say to you to blind you?!

Misha:
I don't know...

Skullshatterer:
Sorry...

Skullshatterer:
I'm getting too emotional.

Skullshatterer:
But one thing is certain...

Skullshatterer:
Reunion has finally provided a sliver of hope to the Infected after all this time...

Skullshatterer:
But Rhodes Island, despite being Infected, chose to hurt us, to slaughter us!

Skullshatterer:
What are they but traitors?!

Skullshatterer:
What is there to discuss with traitors?!

Misha:
Are the Infected doomed to always kill each other then?

Skullshatterer:
Then, what am I supposed to do...

Skullshatterer:
Should I just stand by and watch my comrades die?

Misha:
...

Skullshatterer:
Don't worry.

Skullshatterer:
We'll protect you.

Skullshatterer:
You'll also have to protect yourself though...

Skullshatterer:
Don't get pulled into the fighting.

Skullshatterer:
Please be careful...

Misha:
Promise... you'll come back...

Misha:
Just when I finally found you again...

Skullshatterer:
Yeah. I'll come back for you.

Skullshatterer:
Then, we'll go home together...

Misha:
...Mhm.

W:
Hey there.

W:
So, you need my help after all?

Skullshatterer:
That's right.

Skullshatterer:
Actually... the situation is a bit different from what Talulah told us.

Skullshatterer:
The enemy is more powerful than we expected.

Skullshatterer:
That's why... you have to protect Misha.

W:
I don't think I'm obligated to do that.

Skullshatterer:
You are.

W:
Fine, fine.

W:
However, it's not enough to just protect Misha, is it?

W:
If you fail, they'll still catch up to us.

Skullshatterer:
...

Skullshatterer:
What do you have in mind?

W:
Skullshatterer, don't you remember what I told you before?

Skullshatterer:
...I do.

Skullshatterer:
We can turn the tables if we take out that target.

Skullshatterer:
Dr. {@nickname}...

W:
See, you were paying attention. All we have to do is take out their commander. Easy, right?

W:
The hooded person who's always next to that bunny girl.

W:
The person who leads Rhodes Island's combat operations.

W:
If you can kill that one... Bang!

W:
Just like that, their brain will be gone.

W:
Everything will be so easy after that~

W:
We don't have many troops left, and we're running out of options.

W:
There's a location near the front of the mines that will be great for setting up our ambush.

W:
My casters will provide cover for you... You know what to do, don't you?

W:
I'll use my troops to draw them here.

W:
Don't miss this opportunity~

Skullshatterer:
I understand.

Skullshatterer:
...Take care of Misha for me.

W:
Sure thing~

W:
Hmph... Anyways, good luck.
