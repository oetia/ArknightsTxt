Londinium

Molly:
Lady Golding, at last, you're back!

Golding:
Did I make it in time?

Molly:
Of course. You've rehearsed this play for well over a year, and this is the first time the children are performing the whole thing. We couldn't possibly start the show without you.

Golding:
I must find myself a good seat, then.

Molly:
Children, are you ready?

Mischievous Boys & Innocent Girls:
Ready!

Golding:
Let's begin, then.

Molly:
Lights—

Farmer:
Good morning, sir! There is a look of concern on your face. Is something worrying you?

Noble:
The horn of victory has blown atop the walls for three days and nights, but why do I feel uneasy?

Farmer:
Has our great general not returned triumphant? Praise his bravery and fearlessness!

Noble:
Bravery? Fearlessness? Perhaps. But you did not see the light in his eyes when he returned? When he gazed upon the crown, he was like a condorwing circling above a limping meatbeast.

Farmer:
Greed can send the most kindhearted man straight to hell.

Noble:
And the masses will forever believe he reaped only what he had sown.

Londinium Merchant:
These are our terms, Miss Allerdale.

Londinium Merchant:
You need certain... 'goods' transported into Londinium, and this is nothing like what we usually carry. Both the quantity and the weight... are highly unusual.

Londinium Merchant:
I shan't ask what it is you need transported and why you need them brought into the city, but you must know that the risk we will carry for transporting them is immense.

Londinium Merchant:
And I'm certain you know there are not many men out there who can do this for you.

Londinium Merchant:
The Sarkaz keep a close eye on all ports of entry. Should they learn of this under-the-table deal, not one of us will leave Londinium alive.

Londinium Merchant:
Even if your background and the greed of your friends watching your back are enough to keep your lifestyle in Central Londinium as is, I'm afraid they won't help with this affair.

Londinium Merchant:
If you want this deal to go through, you must put something worth the risk on the table.

Allerdale:
......

Allerdale:
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me, Mr. Bader. I will consider your proposal.

Londinium Merchant:
Time waits for no one. You must make your decision soon.

Clovisia:
Their asking price is high.

Allerdale:
We've discussed this situation. The Royal Mint is in Sarkaz hands. News of this must've already spread throughout the entire country via the Magna bankers.

Allerdale:
Merchant smugglers are worried that the payment they earn will be worthless by this time next month. Naturally, they demand a method of payment that will keep its value in the long term.

Clovisia:
You intend to accept his terms?

Allerdale:
Mr. Bader was right. 'Time waits for no one.'

Allerdale:
We have at most five more days to prepare. If we are to ambush the Defense Forces' command tower, we need to bring more weapons into the city.

Clovisia:
But... what they demand is very dear to you.

Allerdale:
......

Allerdale:
Hah.

Allerdale:
But this is the position we are in, Clovisia.

Allerdale:
This is the position <i>I</i> am in.

Allerdale:
How would you figure what it means to me?

Clovisia:
I'm afraid...

Allerdale:
No, I can say this for sure. Your speculations are all wrong.

Allerdale:
Do you think of me simply as the magnificent Duke of Cumberland?

Allerdale:
My name is Cumberland, and everyone knows Cumberland was His Majesty's most faithful friend.

Allerdale:
Do you think the reason I stand here in front of you completely unharmed is because the bigwigs in Parliament had mercy on me?

Allerdale:
Even now, I still regularly attend Lt. Colonel Lettou's cocktail parties. My words still carry some weight there, and they still need me to soothe the masses.

Allerdale:
Of course, this is for our cause. It is also my own means.

Clovisia:
I understand your sacrifice. Without your protection, the Self-Salvation Corps could not have made it to this day.

Allerdale:
I'm not a girl anymore...

Allerdale:
That thing in the attic means nothing.

Allerdale:
It is a pile of scrap.

Allerdale:
...Ailshie.

Allerdale:
Make the arrangements and have it brought down from the attic.

Ailshie:
......

Allerdale:
You disagree with my decision?

Ailshie:
I dare not speak, Miss.

Allerdale:
I demand it of you.

Ailshie:
Lady Allerdale, no matter what you say, it... it's still House Cumberland's steam armor!

Ailshie:
The blood of your ancestors—that most esteemed Duke's blood flows within that armor. It is an honor that Victoria bestowed upon House Cumberland, and it is the symbol of your house, 'Ever on High.'

Ailshie:
It can be destroyed in the flames of war, it can be given to another who is noble and unsullied. It can't... It can't be traded to a greedy merchant.

Allerdale:
You don't think Mr. Bader is worthy?

Ailshie:
An ancient set of armor! Treated as a lowly collectible! And then traded away at a bargain price for just—

Allerdale:
Ailshie, you've been at my side all these years, ever since I was born.

Allerdale:
We've kept the long fallen 'House Cumberland' alive.

Allerdale:
My house was built on nothing but a bunch of empty words. 'Glory,' 'loyalty,' 'nobility,' or perhaps, 'benevolence?' But none of them hold any meaning today.

Allerdale:
It's you and I upon whom this house now stands.

Ailshie:
I understand, Miss.

Allerdale:
Have we gotten a letter from them today...?

Ailshie:
Not yet.

Allerdale:
......

Allerdale:
You know? The music of the past... as if it still rings loud in my head.

Allerdale:
This manor once hosted a king, but where is he now?

Siege:
......

Allerdale:
My apologies, Your Highness—

Siege:
...Call me Vina.

Allerdale:
Welcome, Vina.

Siege:
I've returned from patrolling with the fighters.

Allerdale:
You're still willing to go on missions with the fighters of the Self-Salvation Corps. Splendid.

Siege:
I want to do as much as I can.

Allerdale:
It's more than enough for the men to simply know you are here.

Siege:
I've heard from Clovisia...

Allerdale:
Hah, the attic is absolutely cluttered with rubbish. I've got to pull myself together and clean up a bit.

Allerdale:
Lots of dust there. I mustn't have Your Highness helping me with such things.

Siege:
......

Siege:
Allerdale.

Siege:
I don't want you to sell the armor.

Allerdale:
Is that an edict from Your Highness?

Siege:
I have no right to issue one. You're the one responsible for the Self-Salvation Corps, not me.

Siege:
You know better than I what's right for the Corps, and I understand that the armor can buy us an opportunity.

Siege:
But... Please give me some time.

Siege:
I will find a way.

Allerdale:
Vina... You needn't worry yourself over this.

Siege:
Is that an order from the Self-Salvation Corps' Auchterigg District leader?

Allerdale:
Very well.

Allerdale:
If nothing ever happened, perhaps...

Allerdale:
Never mind, it's all in the past.

Londinium Citizen:
Lady Heidi!

Heidi:
What is it? Do we have any news from Golding?

Londinium Citizen:
Yes, she just sent us a message through the transmitter at the bookstore. It's been forwarded to your terminal.

Heidi:
Good... Very good.

Heidi:
She says she's safe. Everything in Auchterigg is proceeding according to plan.

Heidi:
Please send a reply. The Doctor's squad has successfully slipped past the checkpoint and infiltrated Highbury. Thanks to the mercenaries working with Rhodes Island...

Londinium Worker:
Catherine, there's a problem with the conveyor belt at Loading Area No. 9!

Catherine:
Let's have a look.

Catherine:
......

Catherine:
There's a loose nut.

Catherine:
Patto!

Londinium Worker:
I'm here.

Catherine:
You're on shift today, and we're running shorter and shorter on time. What are you doing?

Catherine:
If we don't speed things up, the Sarkaz will smear your brains across this steel here!

Londinium Worker:
Sorry, Catherine.

Catherine:
Now hand me the spanner.

Londinium Worker:
Okay...

???:
Here.

Catherine:
Quick on your feet, all of a sudden...

Catherine:
......

Catherine:
You.

Feist:
Long time no see, Granny.

Feist:
I'm back.

Catherine:
......

Catherine:
Patto!

Londinium Worker:
Catherine...

Catherine:
See your team leader after work for a write-up.

Londinium Worker:
What?!

Catherine:
You let unauthorized personnel into the factory's most important landing zone. You're lucky you haven't been sacked.

Feist:
Granny, this isn't Patto's fault. It wasn't him who let me in.

Catherine:
Good. Patto, bring Tommy and Day with you to get written up. I'd better not see a single one of you trying to wiggle out of this.

Feist:
......

Catherine:
You, and the strange character from god-knows-where next to you...

Catherine:
Come.

Knight:
Sir, why is the palace so quiet?

Old Man:
Palace? What palace?

Knight:
You are facing the outer walls of the palace.

Old Man:
Move aside, big heap of metal. You're blocking the sunlight.

Old Man:
I'm facing nothing but an empty house.

Knight:
I am a Steam Knight. I purge all evil and injustice!

Old Man:
Young man, it's over.

Knight:
No, it is not, nor shall it ever be!

Knight:
So long as we still know what is right and what is wrong, so long as we never hesitate to make the right decision, it shall never be over!

Knight:
I made my way here precisely for that reason. I invite all men to join me!

Knight:
Even you have yet to relax your tightly clenched fist, am I right?

Rhodes Island Operator:
Amiya, our cover's blown!

Amiya:
How many hostiles?

Rhodes Island Operator:
Recon operators report four mercenary patrol teams headed in our direction.

Amiya:
We have to pass through the district to reach the Defense Forces' command tower.

Rhodes Island Operator:
And we've only just made it inside...

Amiya:
The Sarkaz forces are way too quick to react. We're being ambushed.

Amiya:
How is the backup route looking?

Rhodes Island Operator:
If the mercenaries have been lured to the front here...

Rhodes Island Operator:
No, it won't work!

Rhodes Island Operator:
There's another squad coming up fast! The Self-Salvation Corps just spotted them!

Amiya:
What did they say?

Rhodes Island Operator:
They had a run-in with this squad when they evacuated from Sudean! They say these Sarkaz fight... well they're...

Rhodes Island Operator:
<i>Inhuman.</i>

Amiya:
The Vampire's men...

Amiya:
Notify all units. The operation has been cancelled. Prepare to pull out immediately.

Rhodes Island Operator:
There's no time. The Vampire fighters are moving way too fast... The Self-Salvation Corps has engaged them!

Amiya:
Change of plans. We're aiding the Self-Salvation Corps!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Where's the Cautus?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
What Cautus?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Don't play dumb with me. She's been with you lot the last couple days.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
I've no idea what you're talking about, and I'm not talking. Not even if you kill me.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Another stubborn bunch.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Urghh—! What's this... Bugs?! Bloody...!

Rhodes Island Operator:
Hang in there, friend!

Rhodes Island Operator:
Back in formation. Don't let the bugs on the ground separate you.

Amiya:
Defender operators, cover our allies' retreat!

Amiya:
Rhodes Island and the Self-Salvation Corps came here together, and so we will leave together!
