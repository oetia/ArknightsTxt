Sarkaz Warrior:
—

Siege:
They're still on our tails.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
You should go... someone of your station shouldn't risk her life for us...

Siege:
Would you say the same if it was Allerdale or Clovisia?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
...You're different.

Siege:
Heads down.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Huh?

Siege's hammer swings through the air, barely missing the fighter's head.

A massive hole appears on the wall with the sound of bricks cracking. Within lies the severed hand of a Sarkaz caster, still holding his wand.

Siege:
Different, am I?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
You... you...

Siege:
Stay close. I'm not in the habit of slowing down my fights.

Siege:
We haven't shaken them yet.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
These Sarkaz are persistent.

Siege:
Their uniform is the same, but the Sarkaz of Sudean are like children compared to these.

Siege:
They're different.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
What should we do? Keep making circles in the streets?

Siege:
You used to sit in front of a desk, didn't you?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Huh? Yes, I was an accountant... why?

Siege:
How did you travel? By car?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Er, yes...

Siege:
Do you know how wide a Londinium alley is? How long it takes to run from one end of Wellington to the other? How many sewer entrances there are on each block?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
...No.

Siege:
They do.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Who does?

Indra:
Over here, Vina!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Target sighted!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Hostiles in the shadows!

Morgan:
This way, Vina!

Siege:
I hear explosions coming from the safehouse.

Siege:
The Corps fighters aren't moving quick enough. We have to cover their retreat.

Morgan:
Grr. This way!

Dagda:
Siege!

Siege:
Dagda, what's the situation?

Dagda:
Clovisia evacuated with most of them. Allerdale...

Allerdale:
...I'm fine.

Siege:
You're hurt.

Allerdale:
I can take care of myself.

Allerdale:
You should not have returned, Your Highness.

Sarkaz Warrior:
They're inside.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Kill them all.

Dagda:
Forgive my bluntness, Siege, I don't think you should...

Siege:
You don't think I should have come back either?

Dagda:
No, I don't think you should be at front, by yourself.

Dagda:
Allow me to stand by your side, from time to time.

Siege:
Very well. Come forward, Dagda.

Allerdale:
......

Siege:
You need to rest, Allerdale.

Allerdale:
The daughter of the Duke of Cumberland can't lose to the daughter of the Count of Manchester.

Siege:
I know Allerdale and Dagda better.

Allerdale:
Then I'll stand by your side, as your friend, Allerdale.

Siege:
What about you, soldier? Can you stand?

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Y-Yes...

Siege:
Then grab your weapon and fight.

Siege:
Londinium... this iron jungle belongs to us. It's time to show the Sarkaz who is hunter and who is hunted.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Your station won't save you, Aslan.

Sarkaz Warrior:
We don't care.

Sarkaz Warrior:
The Sarkaz future is now. You'll be buried with the past.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Wait...

Sarkaz Warrior:
Look out! Ambush, behind the shelves!

Siege:
You're sharp.

Morgan:
Hey! Over here!

Indra:
No, here!

Dagda:
Do it, Siege!

Siege:
Now then.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Look out!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Flashy, but pointless.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Playtime's over. Drop your weapon and you can die a quick death.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Make things easier for both of us.

Allerdale:
Sorry... I got careless.

Siege:
No need to apologize.

The Sarkaz gazes at Siege, and Siege gazes at Allerdale.

She raises her hands slowly. Her hammer falls to the ground with a bang.

She winks at Allerdale, who raises the corner of her mouth.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Wait... wind? But we're indoors...

Allerdale:
Vina, catch!

Siege:
Now then.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Gah—!

Siege:
Are you alright?

Allerdale:
I'm in a good mood, at least.

Sarkaz Warrior:
The warehouse is collapsing! Pull out! Surround them outside!

Indra:
Your safehouse doesn't seem so solid.

Allerdale:
Safehouses aren't meant to be impregnable fortresses.

Allerdale:
Follow me.

Allerdale:
The hidden passage should be blocked under the rubble, but we need to up our pace.

Allerdale:
Ugh...

Siege:
You need to get your wounds wrapped, Allerdale.

Allerdale:
I... I'm fine.

Siege:
Dagda, take the fighter back to the Self-Salvation Corps camp. We'll split up.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Your Hig—Siege.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
You showed your leadership. Now it's our turn to show you what we can do.

Self-Salvation Corps Fighter:
Thank you.

Morgan:
Where are you going?

Siege:
Allerdale's injuries can't wait. I'll find somewhere nearby...

Siege:
Wait, I remember this place...

Allerdale:
Surprised you still have an impression of this alley, Vina.

Allerdale:
That afternoon, when you brought back the Sighs of Kings, with them.

Siege:
...What?

Allerdale:
Nothing. Let's keep going.

Allerdale:
This path connects the palace to the ducal residence. Not many know of its existence.

Allerdale:
I have assurances from one whose word carries weight that Cumberland Manor will be safe until tomorrow.

Allerdale:
Enough for us to get these little flesh wounds treated.

Allerdale:
Vina...

Siege:
You knew I was there?

Allerdale:
I know what sounds I should hear from outside my room.

Allerdale:
My dear Lady Vina, staring at me won't heal the wounds on my back.

Allerdale:
Would you kindly change the bandages?

Siege:
...Right.

Allerdale:
Ugh...

Siege:
Sorry, was I too heavy-handed?

Allerdale:
It's nothing. I just let my guard down when there aren't so many eyes on me.

Siege:
You bled a lot... how many times did you get hit?

Allerdale:
Most of them don't hurt anymore.

Siege:
If I reacted faster... maybe it would have saved you a scar.

Allerdale:
Escaping from those fighters was no mean feat.

Allerdale:
Besides, I've been wanting to thank you for days.

Allerdale:
You've helped the Corps a lot, and you even saved the old steam armor.

Siege:
I have a responsibility, Allerdale. I... I don't want to see you lose anything else.

Allerdale:
......

Allerdale:
Hah.

Allerdale:
No matter, Vina. If there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that life usually doesn't go the way we want.

Allerdale:
If it did, we wouldn't be hiding in this dark, little room, and we wouldn't be sitting with a bunch of stinking bandages.

Siege:
We...

Allerdale:
Let me think... we'd be sitting in a garden, taking tea together, discussing poetry and the weather.

Allerdale:
We could go hunting. The alcornes are plentiful in the countryside this season. They run fast, but stop and stare when they see a crowd. Do you like hunting?

Siege:
...I don't know.

Allerdale:
I've almost forgotten how it feels myself. But I'm guessing you don't like dancing, at least not at those onerous dance parties in the social season. I don't like them either.

Allerdale:
The dresses are so much stiffer than hunting attire, and so tight they rob you of your appetite for the banquet.

Siege:
Ha, I can imagine.

Siege:
And...

Allerdale:
What?

Siege:
I'm thinking the hunting outfit would look better on you.

Allerdale:
Vina...

Siege:
Yes?

Allerdale:
Perhaps... we should have seen more of each other. Much more.

Siege:
Fate robbed us of a beautiful life, against our will.

Siege:
Luckily, we still have the future...

Allerdale:
What's the matter? You look surprised.

Siege:
...I'm talking about the future.

Allerdale:
You don't do that often?

Siege:
Back when I was running for my life, I hardly ever thought about the future. The past was in my dreams, and the future... it was in a fog, where I couldn't see anything.

Allerdale:
This is not a flaw, Vina. It's a virtue.

Allerdale:
Nobles like to talk about the future, but most of them are more concerned about the dinner menu.

Allerdale:
It's not because they've grown numb to life, but because they understand how precious the present is.

Siege:
Like the present now?

Allerdale:
Yes...

Allerdale:
Like the present now.

Allerdale:
Ailshie.

Ailshie:
Good morning, Lady Allerdale. Everything is in order.

Allerdale:
The steam armor... why have you taken it out?

Allerdale:
It's too big to take with us.

Ailshie:
...Is that so?

Ailshie:
Has Her Highness Alexandrina left?

Allerdale:
Yes, she has her own mission.

Ailshie:
Your injuries...

Allerdale:
Are fine, thanks to Her Highness.

Ailshie:
I haven't seen you smile like this in a long time.

Allerdale:
Am I being too calm before the storm?

Allerdale:
It does bring back long-forgotten feelings to stand with Her Highness and the others.

Allerdale:
It's been some time since I encountered someone I could trust.

Ailshie:
Her Highness Alexandrina saved this armor for you. I may be a lowly servant, but I feel a sense of gratitude.

Ailshie:
It's the pride of Cumberland.

Allerdale:
Pride...

Ailshie:
The armor and your honored ancestors... I remember how you used to talk to them.

Allerdale:
Children like to wallow in fantasy.

Allerdale:
But I learned, twenty-six years ago, that it's no hero, just a broken hunk of metal.

Allerdale:
We've all changed, yet the armor seems frozen in time.

Allerdale:
Do you... like Her Highness Alexandrina?

Ailshie:
Her Highness is very kind. I've seen how she treats her fellows, eating the same food and sleeping in the same room.

Ailshie:
She's not like most nobles. She doesn't see them as her servants, nor will she abandon them.

Allerdale:
Victoria is fortunate.

Allerdale:
The heart of Her Highness is strong. Years of exile have not undermined her dignity and integrity.

Ailshie:
You said Victoria. What about yourself, my lady? What do you think of Her Highness?

Allerdale:
......

Allerdale:
I hope she has a bright future.

Ailshie:
So you...?

Allerdale:
I got a letter last night. Two in the same day.

Allerdale:
She's... impatient.

Ailshie:
But you've reunited with Her Highness!

Ailshie:
Do you remember how Her Highness came here with the Sighs of Kings, twenty-six years ago? It must've been a sign, and its portents might come true very soon!

Ailshie:
We've waited for so long, Miss. You could...

Allerdale:
He...

Allerdale:
......

Allerdale:
I've long since given up waiting, Ailshie.

Allerdale:
How long has it been since Jim left?

Ailshie:
He returned home to County Peninsula the year after the incident.

Allerdale:
...Twenty-five years. We haven't had a gardener for a quarter century.

Allerdale:
I used to love the bushes that grew there. They tripped me from time to time, but the tiny golden flowers that bloomed from them were so beautiful.

Allerdale:
The first batch all died the winter after Jim left.

Allerdale:
Mother sent people all around and learned that it was the noblest breed from Minos. The money it took to buy those seeds would have fed an ordinary family of Londiniers for half a decade.

Ailshie:
Your garden remains beautiful, even without that particular kind of bush.

Allerdale:
I tried, Ailshie. We all tried. You toiled tirelessly, summer and winter, in order to keep the garden in good shape.

Allerdale:
But without those seeds, our garden would never return to its former glory.

Allerdale:
I sent her a letter the fifth New Year's Day after Dad died.

Allerdale:
Her reply included the seeds that House Cumberland could no longer afford.

Allerdale:
......

Allerdale:
Ailshie... we've always been living like this.

Ailshie:
If the Duke was here...

Allerdale:
...She always had tricks up her sleeve.

Ailshie:
No, my lady, I meant your father.

Allerdale:
Father... father.

Allerdale:
I can hardly recall his voice now.

Allerdale:
Perhaps it's only in this garden that I... that I remember how he held my hand, taught my how to swing a sword, knocked me down, then picked me back up and sat me on his shoulder...

Allerdale:
......

Allerdale:
I wanted to preserve them, many years ago, Ailshie. I tried everything I could. The garden, the armor... and the shadow of my father.

Allerdale:
But there is nothing worth less than 'want'.

Allerdale:
I remember how I wanted to become a Steam Knight when I was little.

Allerdale:
......

Allerdale:
Ailshie. Sometimes... just sometimes, I think...

Allerdale:
Growing up is such a cruel thing, isn't it?

Allerdale:
With the exception of a lucky few, we all become tired and unremarkable adults.

Allerdale:
Always treading carefully, not daring to speak our minds, grasping at straws when the waves are rough, and never letting go of the ones we find.

Allerdale:
What did you want to be when you were little, Ailshie? Not the servant of a fallen house, surely?

Ailshie:
No, it's an honor to be by your side...

Allerdale:
I want the truth.

Ailshie:
Well... I suppose... I listened to a lot of bard's tales when I was little.

Allerdale:
Ah. Ailshie the Bard.

Ailshie:
Please don't tease me.

Allerdale:
Growing up means toppling, crushing, turning to dust the possibilities that we thought were within our reach when we were little.

Allerdale:
And here we are.

Allerdale:
Can I preserve House Cumberland's glory? It passed beyond my reach a long time ago.

Allerdale:
I, Allerdale, am who I am now.

Ailshie:
...But even you cannot say who Allerdale will be, can you?

Allerdale:
Will be...?

Ailshie:
I'm old, Miss. I couldn't squeeze a tune out of an instrument, even if I had the chance.

Ailshie:
But you promised me.

Ailshie:
Maybe you thought it was just a childish fancy.

Ailshie:
But I've always believed that you could do it.

Ailshie:
To be a Steam Knight greater than Charles Lynch, greater than any of your ancestors.

Ailshie:
You'll do it for me, won't you?

Allerdale:
Enough, Ailshie! She wouldn't permit...

Ailshie:
Then what do you want to do?

Ailshie:
I'm behind you, no matter your choice.

Allerdale:
I—

Ailshie:
Take your time. You always make the right decision.

Ailshie:
Miss... permit me walk around this garden, one last time.

Ailshie:
It's most dear to me... even if it's just a shadow of its former self.

Allerdale wants to say something, but does not open her mouth.

She watches someone, with whom she has spent virtually every day of her entire life, walk towards the center of the garden. They have been through the worst of times together, and have been transformed them in ways they could not have imagined.

Allerdale realizes that she has not seen Ailshie smile like this for years.

She feels a sense of tranquility, one that she has not felt in ages.

If there is still a chance—

Suddenly, Allerdale's attention is drawn to a speck of orange in the distance.

It rapidly draws near, and she feels the temperature around her rise.

Allerdale:
Ailshie! Quick, we must—

In an instant, the manor is engulfed in flames.

Lt. Colonel Lettou:
...Your Highness.

Sanguinarch of Vampires:
Quiet.

Sanguinarch of Vampires:
You're disturbing my enjoyment of the view.

Sanguinarch of Vampires:
Storied history turns to cinder. The proud manors of the nobles, reduced to charred ruins.

Sanguinarch of Vampires:
Tiles carefully sculpted and laid over centuries peel off one by one. Flowers collected from all the corners of the land wilt and wither.

Lt. Colonel Lettou:
My orders were to investigate the nobles.

Sanguinarch of Vampires:
Are you not happy with what I'm doing, 'Commander'?

Sanguinarch of Vampires:
Do you not enjoy the flames? Does the sound of blood evaporating not interest you?

Sanguinarch of Vampires:
'Hiss, hiss.' Listen and savor, Lettou, my friend.

Sanguinarch of Vampires:
I'm examining every drop of blood, as is my responsibility...

Lt. Colonel Lettou:
......

Lt. Colonel Lettou:
I will assist your investigation, ensuring that no... traitor... walks free.

Lt. Colonel Lettou:
As is my duty.
