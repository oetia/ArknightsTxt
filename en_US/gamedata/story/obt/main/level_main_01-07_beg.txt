Dobermann:

Dobermann:
There's too much coming... at this rate, every single building in this city is going to be destroyed!

Dobermann:
This is looking bad...!

Ace:

Ace:
We have to relocate!

Medic:

Reunion Member:

Reunion Member:

Nearl:

Ace:
A massive cluster just toppled the building across the street from us! Get down! !

Medic:
Eeek...!

Amiya:
... Don't stand there... Medic! Watch out!

Guard:
Oh no... Medic, get out of there!

Medic:
Aaaahh!

Medic:
...Huh, D-Doctor?

Guard:
The Doctor pushed the medic out of the way? Wouldn't that mean... Doctor...?!

Guard:
No, Doctor!!

Nearl:

Nearl:
I can still hold my shield...!

Nearl:
Jump, Doctor!

Nearl:
Jump!

Amiya:
Doctor, Doctor...

Amiya:
You're, you're not hurt?

Nearl:
How could you... put yourself in danger like that!

Nearl:
At least take me with you, so I can protect you!

Nearl:
I can't allow you to be harmed...

Nearl:
Especially, right before my eyes!

Amiya:
We should count ourselves lucky that everyone is still safe...!

Amiya:
But...

Amiya:
(How much longer is this going to last?)

Amiya:
(How long are we going to be able to stay alive?)

Amiya:
... Hm...

Amiya:
Are fewer rocks falling now?

Amiya:
So we managed to weather the first impact...

Dobermann:
But we have to be careful still. Nobody knows how long this Catastrophe will continue for.

Dobermann:
At least... we weren't caught dead in the middle of it.

Dobermann:
We were lucky to slip through.

Amiya:
Mmhm...

Amiya:
How's everyone doing?

Guard:
Looks like all of the Operators made it through just fine...!

Guard:
Some were lightly injured, but considering the circumstances, we were quite fortunate!

Guard:
We... we made it!

Reunion Member:
Ugh...

Amiya:
Some of the Reunion members have also...

Reunion Member:
...Huh?

Reunion Member:
Huh... Ahh! ! Rhodes Island!

Dobermann:
...What?

Reunion Member:
Arghh...!!

Amiya:
They're still trying to attack us?!

Reunion Member:
...

Reunion Member:
Rhodes Island!

Dobermann:
What's wrong with you bunch!

Reunion Member:
Come back here...!

Dobermann:
They've gone insane.

Nearl:
Do they not value their lives at all?!

Amiya:
Dobermann...

Dobermann:
We have no choice...

Dobermann:
We'll suppress them first, and then immediately relocate!
