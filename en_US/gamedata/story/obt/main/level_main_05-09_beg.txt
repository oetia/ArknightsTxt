Outside Immigration Department, L.G.D. Headquarters 2nd Floor, Upper Lungmen.

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en, something's wrong. Don't you think it's strange that we were able to enter the headquarters so easily?

L.G.D. Agent:
There were so many Reunion forces outside so we braced ourselves for a hard fight, but it was as if they were sleepwalking.

L.G.D. Agent:
According to our scouts' intel, their equipment is practically damaged to the point of unusability. It's unlikely that they've seen much combat, and their degree of preparedness seems...

L.G.D. Agent:
It creeps me out.

Ch'en:
I've noticed as well. They don't even know we're here. At least they're not a threat right now.

Ch'en:
We'll follow the plan. Next, our non-combat squads will scout out the distribution of Reunion forces on each floor, and attempt to restart the security system that was disabled earlier.

Ch'en:
Additionally, we'll need to be ready to hold off a possible Reunion encirclement. We must hold out until our plan is implemented smoothly.

L.G.D. Agent:
Understood.

Ch'en:
Focus your attention on controlling the situation inside.

L.G.D. Agent:
According to our sources, Reunion's temporary command center is on the rooftop.

Ch'en:
The rooftop? What kind of leader would put their command center on the roof?

Ch'en:
Hmm... there's a significant possibility of this being a trap.

L.G.D. Agent:
But we don't have a choice, do we, Madam?

Ch'en:
That's right. Taking back the rooftop would be like lighting Lungmen's signal beacon. We will let Reunion witness the moment when the L.G.D. Headquarters returns to our hands.

Ch'en:
We ought to lead them all here.

Ch'en:
Get ready, there are still a few hours to go. Let the recon and engineer squads go first. The combat squads still have some time to rest up before the main operation begins.

Ch'en:
Don't waste even the smallest opportunity to create an advantage. Expect our enemies to fight to the death.

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en, something doesn't feel right about this building.

Ch'en:
What do you mean?

L.G.D. Agent:
Let me make a conjecture first. As we get closer to the top floor, we may encounter some resistance. Perhaps there are some enemies stationed on the roof.

L.G.D. Agent:
However, the lower floors were completely empty. Only on the sixth floor did enemies start to appear, and while their numbers have increased, they haven't posed any threat.

L.G.D. Agent:
Just now, one of my squad members reported that he thought he saw some Reunion members walk down a corridor, but they disappeared in the blink of an eye.

L.G.D. Agent:
Another member told me that he heard some whispering, but when he went to investigate, he didn't find anything.

L.G.D. Agent:
That's all we found from our investigation. But something feels wrong to me still.

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
Let's go first. I don't have time for your nonsensical ghost stories.

Ch'en:
Even if there was something anomalous going on, I'll handle it after this is all over.

L.G.D. Agent:
Yes ma'am!

Ch'en:
Let's take the fire escape route here. Though we don't it often, it's going to come in handy now.

Ch'en:
This staircase will take us straight to the rooftop.

Ch'en:
You'll all control the top floor and use your vision advantage to cover me. I'll head directly to the rooftop, and rejoin you after the situation is stabilized.

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en, are you really going alone? Whatever the situation is, I'm sure we'll be able to help.

Ch'en:
I have full confidence in your abilities. However, I might have to go all out in this coming battle.

Ch'en:
The most you can do to help me is to clear Reunion out of this entire building, and make sure I have nothing else to worry about.

L.G.D. Agent:
In that case, we won't get in your way, Madam Ch'en. Lungmen is counting on you.

Ch'en:
Wrong. Lungmen is counting on us.

L.G.D. Agent:
Yessir!

Ch'en:
Hurry!

???:
Good evening, Madam.

???:
You charged straight into my trap alone. Should I call you brave, or just stupid?

Ch'en:
You have no where to run, Reunion commander.

Mephisto:
Is that so? From my perspective, Madam, you are the one who has nowhere to run. My comrades shall devour you.

Ch'en:
Talk is cheap. Show me what you've got.

Ch'en:
You should never have set foot here, Reunion!
