Mephisto:
*cough* *cough*...

Ch'en:
You're no match for me!

Mephisto:
You defeated all my comrades single-handedly? Perhaps I must re-evaluate your abilities, Madam.

Ch'en:
That's enough.

Mephisto:
No, far from it. Faust, give her a shake-down.

Faust:
Understood.

Ch'en:
...!

Ch'en:
Those on the roof, get down!

L.G.D. Agent:
Ahh!

Ch'en:
Reunion's sniper...

Ch'en:
(I even made sure to prepare for ranged attacks, but how does he pack this much firepower...?)

Ch'en:
That's not enough to save your life. You'll die before your sniper can land a shot on me.

Ch'en:
...Wait. Were you arrested by the L.G.D. before?

Faust:
...

Mephisto:
Your bunch caused him a great deal of grief. But it's nothing compared to what Ursus did to us.

Mephisto:
He missed that shot on purpose, dear Madam. We'll spare your life this once, so take this as a gesture of kindness.

Mephisto:
Right now, the seeds of unrest have been sown within the L.G.D.

Mephisto:
It was your organization's corruption and negligence that gave him the chance to cooperate with us.

Ch'en:
...Reunion scum, you know nothing about this world.

Mephisto:
Were you trying to say something profound?

Ch'en:
Did you think that Faust was rescued by Reunion?

Mephisto:
There were many Infected in the L.G.D. at the time.

Ch'en:
Twenty-one.

Mephisto:
...

Ch'en:
Did you think that at least four of them would side with Reunion?

Ch'en:
But even those four were set up by me. After they got in contact with you, did you lock one of them up?

Mephisto:
Very clever, Madam. She ran away.

Ch'en:
Have you still not realized the situation you're now in?

Mephisto:
Of course I've figured it out. My squad has been crushed, and I'm the only one left.

Mephisto:
Our forces wandering around outside are hopelessly weak, and my comrades have basically lost their will to fight.

Mephisto:
Is this what you wanted to hear me say?

Ch'en:
I suppose you're not that arrogant after all.

Mephisto:
Well then... Come, my guards.

Mephisto:
Rise.

Reunion Member:
Ugh... argh... Ooaarrrggh!!!

Ch'en:
What did you do?!

Ch'en:
The bits of Originium on their bodies... are growing?

Mephisto:
The Originium will pierce through their bodies and become their new form.

Mephisto:
Behold, Officer. These are my guards, my immortal guards.

Mephisto's Guard:
GRAAAAAAGHHH!!

Mephisto:
Take it all, my herd, my comrades...

Mephisto:
Fwoo...

Ch'en:
Powder...?

Mephisto:
My comrades need healing. They need me.

Ch'en:
Arts? All squads, be on alert! The enemy commander is casting wide-range Arts using some kind of powder!

Mephisto:
Don't worry, Madam. This does not concern you, as you are not my comrade.

Reunion Member:
Ugh... Aagghhâ€”

ReUni N MemBr:
...Unghh... Nnngh!

ReUMmbr? N;E? OE:
Nghhhaaahghh...

???:
Grrraaaaaaaaaaaghh!

Mephisto's hERd:
...Blood!! Blood!! Aaaargh!!! Aaaaaggh!!!

Mephisto:
Quiet now.

Mephisto's HeRd:
...

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en, it's looking bad...

L.G.D. Agent:
All the defeated Reunion members started to transform into hulking monstrosities after coming in contact with that powder!

L.G.D. Agent:
They've started attacking us again, and they're slowly moving towards our defense line!

Ch'en:
Just how many of them have transformed?

L.G.D. Agent:
All of them!

Ch'en:
...!

Mephisto:
They are my herd, as well as my brethren.

Mephisto:
G7, G6.

Mephisto's Herd:
...Urgh.

Ch'en:
You...

Mephisto:
They shall never fall, because I will take away all their pain.

Ch'en:
You're just manipulating them like puppets. How can you call them your brethren?

Mephisto:
I see no difference between the two. For the greater good, we are willing to become anything.

Ch'en:
If this is what you call the greater good... Looks like you're the only one I need to get rid of.

Mephisto:
You have a sense of purpose, and the will to get it done. I'm quite drawn to you, Madam.

L.G.D. Agent:
Focus your fire! Hurry! Aim at the enemy commander!

Mephisto's Guard:
...

Mephisto's Guard:
Urrrrgghhhh...

Mephisto:
But you'll find that my guards are not so easily defeated.

L.G.D. Agent:
They just blocked the explosion with their flesh... and they're completely unscathed?!

L.G.D. Agent:
That amount of firepower... should've been enough to blast through a layer of the city's fortified walls!

Mephisto:
Don't waste your effort.

Mephisto:
Wounds will heal. Flesh will harden. Life will return.

Mephisto:
Their weapons cannot hurt my guards. After all, I prepared them especially for you.

Mephisto:
Rise, my comrades. Don't let anyone interfere with our conversation.

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en, Reunion is attacking us wave after wave! We can't defeat them using conventional methods!

L.G.D. Agent:
Damn it, do they not feel any pain?!

L.G.D. Agent:
The other squads are also in the same situation! The Reunion members outside have also started moving. They keep charging towards the headquarters, trying to attack our security facilities!

Ch'en:
Prioritize taking care of the enemies in your immediate vicinity!

L.G.D. Agent:
Out of my way!

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en, these things have no sense of feeling at all! They've completely surrounded the L.G.D. Headquarters!

L.G.D. Agent:
We're being forced into melee combat! We won't be able to support you!

Ch'en:
Take care of yourselves.

L.G.D. Agent:
Roger!

Mephisto:
Majestic, isn't it? After so many battles, their minds seem to have fallen apart, but their bodies are still healthy and strong.

Mephisto:
Sheer strength seems to be able to slightly make up for mistakes in decision-making.

Mephisto:
At least we'll have ample time to slowly talk through our issues.

Mephisto:
I'd like to have a fruitful discussion with you, Madam, about things that aren't related to this battle.

Ch'en:
There's no need for that.

Ch'en:
I'll just kill you right now.

Mephisto:
You're fast!

Faust:
...

Mephisto:
But not fast enough.

Ch'en:
!

Faust:
She deflected my shot with her blade?

Mephisto's Guard:
...

Ch'en:
That black-haired kid has a good read on my movements.

Ch'en:
Tsk... Looks like their plan is to harass me with sniper shots, and then predict my movements while blocking me off.

Mephisto:
Sorry, Madam. I can pretty much predict all your possible moves. All I need to do is block you off a bit.

Mephisto:
This way, you'll never be able to close the gap. So, which do you prefer? Sharp arrows, explosive bolts, or heavy spikes?

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
Looks like you really came here prepared.

Ch'en:
But when a chessmaster finishes his preparations, he's assuming that his opponent will be playing the other color.

Mephisto:
(Wait, why is my powder still sticking to her body...?)

Mephisto:
(So that's what's going on, I see...)

Ch'en:
I'm not good with the theoretical stuff like you, but I simply come prepared for everything.

Ch'en:
Your chessboard cannot contain me, brat. I am no chess piece. I am Lungmen's blade.

Mephisto:
Hmm...

Mephisto:
The line between bravery and stupidity is fine indeed.

Mephisto:
Or were you planning to pull out some kind of trump card? If I remember correctly, I've never seen you use that other sword of yours in combat.

Mephisto:
Surely it's not just there for decoration, right?

Ch'en:
Hah.

Ch'en:
This sword was not meant to be drawn against the likes of you.

Ch'en:
You aren't worth of it, no matter what.

Ch'en:
However, you must pay for your sins, for all you've done to the innocent people of Lungmen and Chernobog.

Faust:
...

Ch'en:
Right here, right now.

Wei Yenwu:
This belongs to you now.

Ch'en:
I don't need it.

Wei Yenwu:
Well, just treat it as a loan.

Ch'en:
Are you not afraid?

Wei Yenwu:
Afraid of what? You turning against me?

Ch'en:
Yes.

Wei Yenwu:
No, I am not.

Ch'en:
Why's that?

Wei Yenwu:
Because I am not scared of death.

Ch'en:
...

Wei Yenwu:
This is no ordinary weapon. You'll gradually come to understand it.

Wei Yenwu:
Do not waste its power on trivial things. A dragonslaying sword shall only be unsheathed against a worthy enemy.

Wei Yenwu:
Who you choose to draw this sword upon is entirely up to you.

Ch'en:
(...This sword is still hibernating.)

Ch'en:
(You still refuse to be unsheathed even in this situation...)

Ch'en:
(But right now, Chi Xiao, you must drink their blood!)
