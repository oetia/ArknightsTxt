Dobermann:
Scouting complete. I can confirm that the enemies pursuing us have been eliminated.

Dobermann:
We've managed to break through their encirclement. We'll be at the outskirts of Chernobog soon.

Ace:
Even though the enemies we defeated today were just a small portion of the whole force...

Ace:
At least we're safe for now.

Nearl:
Thank you for what you did back there. I am forever in your debt.

Ace:
Don't say stuff like that. I don't have the right to ask the Radiant Knight for repayment anyway.

Ace:
Anyway, let's talk about that sniper, Nearl.

Nearl:
Sure.

Nearl:
Putting aside the destructive power of that ballista...

Nearl:
I think... he might have set up several turrets in advance, as well as other automatically-firing devices.

Nearl:
I was targeted from different directions... but I only saw one sniper.

Ace:
I had the same feeling.

Ace:
The first and second shots exploded at about the same time, but there was a noticeable delay between them.

Ace:
Those shots weren't fired from the same repeating ballista. At least, when we returned fire, we weren't targeting the same sniper.

Nearl:
Ace, did you realize something?

Ace:
I can't say for sure. What if the enemy was moving so quickly... to the point of basically being in several places at once?

Nearl:
There's no way anyone could move that quickly. I can't even imagine how it'd be possible.

Nearl:
We can't underestimate how dangerous Reunion is.

Dobermann:
It was that malicious brat who ordered the sniper to go after you. He didn't even call upon the sniper when he was attacking us...

Nearl:
Looks like that disgusting personality of his is backed up by some real power.

Ace:
However, he never attacked us, even when he was angry.

Dobermann:
So either his combat capabilities are lacking, or he simply chose to not display his true abilities yet.

Dobermann:
Just seeing his commanding abilities in action... makes me highly suspicious.

Dobermann:
He was commanding his troops like puppets...

Nearl:
In any case, we're no longer in territory that he controls.

Amiya:
Nearl... Thank you.

Amiya:
If not for your timely arrival, we would have been in grave danger.

Nearl:
I was just following the plan we agreed on beforehand.

Nearl:
You were the one who asked me and Ace to make adjustments depending on the situation.

Nearl:
You solved your own problem.

Nearl:
On my way here, I saw the extent of Reunion's atrocities, and I had doubts about their power.

Nearl:
What if I stopped to engage their forces?

Nearl:
What if I helped Ursus defend against Reunion?

Nearl:
What if I stayed back at the rendezvous point, waiting for you to come to me?

Nearl:
...If I was the one who called the shots, there's no saying how much worse the outcome could have been.

Nearl:
I'm not good at thinking several steps ahead. The only way I know to get what I want is to keep fighting.

Nearl:
Amiya, I was only performing my duties, but you have the ability to end the crisis.

Nearl:
You earned this victory, so have some more confidence in yourself.

Amiya:
Miss Nearl...

Nearl:
Hehe.

Nearl:
This person standing next to you must be the Doctor, then.

Amiya:
That's right. But...

Dobermann:
Every time we meet someone, Amiya has to repeat the story about how the Doctor is suffering from amnesia. What a pain...

Nearl:
Dr. {@nickname}...

Nearl:
One of my friends lost her memories as well. I'm sure you two will get along.

Nearl:
After all, you should understand how precious living in the present is.

Amiya:
Mhm...!

Nearl:
Let's get going, everyone.

Nearl:
We still have to escort the Doctor to Rhodes Island.

Faust:
Sorry... I failed.

Mephisto:
No, don't apologize. It was my mistake. I lost my temper.

Mephisto:
Can you help me track Rhodes Island? I'll report the situation to Talulah first.

Mephisto:
She should have taken over Chernobog's core command tower by now.

Mephisto:
...She will decide the fate of these insects.

Faust:
...Understood.

Mephisto:
Be careful. Your safety is the most important thing, all right?

Faust:
...I will.

Mephisto:
...I suppose my mission is complete too.

Mephisto:
Let's go, comrades.

Mephisto:
Let us go forth and welcome our new era!!
