Dobermann:
Phew... We finally lost them.

Ace:
If we keep up the pace, we'll be out of the central region shortly and arrive at the southern exit.

Dobermann:
It's starting to get noisier and more chaotic...

Dobermann:
It might be because the Chernobog civilians trying to evacuate the city are running into Reunion.

Amiya:
...

Ace:
It seems like a few districts have already been vacated.

Ace:
But those who didn't make it in time are now being held up by Reunion.

Nearl:
...

Ace:
——

Ace:
This place used to be a magificent, sprawling plaza.Now... it's been reduced to ruins.

Ace:
This city tormented the Infected. To meet their end this way is almost poetic.

Dobermann:
Almost...

Dobermann:
You seem quite sentimental.

Ace:
Perhaps, at one point...

Amiya:
The sky's getting even darker.

Amiya:
Even the air has the smell... of something burning.

Civilian:
What are you doing?!

Reunion Member:
...

Civilian:
...Aaaargh!! !

Ace:
————!

Ace:
Civilians?

Dobermann:
I can't hear anything anymore.

Dobermann:
We can't tell who they are from this distance.

Amiya:
...!

Amiya:
Reunion is attacking them...!

Ace:
We can't leverage the terrain to our advantage here. We don't have the capacity to save everybody.

Ace:
Life is very precious, Amiya. Each and every one.

Amiya:
...

Dobermann:
...

Dobermann:
Regardless, we're already too late.

Dobermann:
After all, we're in for some trouble ourselves.

Nearl:
...

Nearl:
We can't catch a break today.

Reunion Member:
...

Reunion Member:
...Kill them all.

Nearl:
A large number of Reunion forces are coming through the exits!

Dobermann:
Get ready to fight our way out!
