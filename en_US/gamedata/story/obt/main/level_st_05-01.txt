L.G.D. Headquarters Rooftop Ruins, Upper Lungmen

Wei Yenwu:
Madam Ch'en, I believe Amiya is right next to you. Can you hear me?

Amiya:
Yes, Chief Wei.

Wei Yenwu:
Very well then.

Wei Yenwu:
I must apologize, leader of Rhodes Island. Though I can risk sending the L.G.D. deep into enemy territory, I can't risk bringing any more players into this game.

Wei Yenwu:
Dr. {@nickname}...

Wei Yenwu:
Beneath this entire land lies an invisible, yet intricate net.

Wei Yenwu:
No single city can break free from this net of conspiracy and intrigue - and especially not Lungmen, as it is situated in the midsts of giants.

Wei Yenwu:
Perhaps you already know this, perhaps you don't. Nevertheless, I have to take all these factors into consideration.

Amiya:
Chief Wei, you should have shared this information with us if you wanted our mission to progress more smoothly.

Amiya:
At least, you should have told me.

Wei Yenwu:
I must apologize yet again, Miss Amiya. From my position, I simply cannot disclose all our intel.

Wei Yenwu:
If you were standing in my shoes, you would have made the same decision.

Wei Yenwu:
What happened in the Chernobog ruins was a pity, but at least you achieved something.

Blaze:
You used us to draw Reunion's attention.

Wei Yenwu:
No, the L.G.D. was right there with you.

Wei Yenwu:
Huh?

Kal'tsit:
He planned for all this a long time ago.

Kal'tsit:
Reunion's infiltration only deepens as time passes, so he had to quickly make a decision.

Kal'tsit:
He led Reunion to believe that the L.G.D. had been separated—

Blaze:
Hah, well said, Dr. {@nickname}! Chief, of course you'd need us to hold Reunion back. The more the better, right?

Blaze:
When the lurking Reunion saw Lungmen in such a state, there's no way they wouldn't spring at the opportunity.

Blaze:
And as soon as they began to emerge from their lairs, then BAM! Lungmen's elite forces would be waiting for them, seemingly out of nowhere.

Blaze:
How long have you been concealing Lungmen's power? Did you already start preparing for this after the Chernobog incident?

Wei Yenwu:
Lungmen kept you safe, and helped you return to a position that could maximize your value.

Blaze:
You left Amiya to die back there in the middle of so many enemies. What kind of 'position' are you talking about?

Wei Yenwu:
I just hope that Rhodes Island can understand that we all have to face this difficult situation together.

Amiya:
Miss Blaze, Dr. {@nickname}, it's fine.

Amiya:
Miss Swire helped us to defeat Reunion's forces, together. Lungmen did not abandon us.

Amiya:
(We don't have any proof.)

Blaze:
Tch...

Wei Yenwu:
Our agreement is still valid. No matter what happened during the process, only the end result can satisfy me.

Wei Yenwu:
No matter what happened.

Wei Yenwu:
Dr. {@nickname} of Rhodes Island, I believe I made myself clear the last time we met.

Wei Yenwu:
You do not have a choice in this matter. But at least you can choose how you eliminate your enemies.

Wei Yenwu:
Isn't that for the best?

Wei Yenwu:
We should all stay alert. Nobody should let their guard down when we are facing a common enemy.

Wei Yenwu:
Your vigilance can keep you from falling into a trap.

Wei Yenwu:
Listen, Dr. {@nickname}—

Wei Yenwu:
...We may not be friends yet, but at least we are not enemies.

Wei Yenwu:
So, silence is your answer.

Wei Yenwu:
A fine display of judgment. You would hide your weaknesses while pressing your advantages.

Wei Yenwu:
Rhodes Island indeed is a powerful partner. You have earned my recognition from this incident.

Wei Yenwu:
But, this comes on the condition that our relationship is still a partnership, not a statement of the status between illegal Infected and local authorities.

Wei Yenwu:
I do not intend to fool anyone.

Wei Yenwu:
Though, objectively speaking, I may well have fooled Reunion.

Wei Yenwu:
But none of that can be proven. Reunion may also have access to our secrets.

Wei Yenwu:
We can only hope to destroy them before they come to grasp our strategies.

Wei Yenwu:
So, does this goal motivate you at all?

Wei Yenwu:
Miss Amiya, Dr. {@nickname}, the cooperation between us has not ended yet.

Wei Yenwu:
A counterattack is imminent. We will demonstrate Lungmen's stature, wisdom, and unity to them.

Wei Yenwu:
If possible, I would also like to witness Rhodes Island's professionalism, resolve, and bravery.

Wei Yenwu:
In fifteen minutes, Madam Ch'en will return to fight at your side.

Amiya:
Mister Wei, I hope you don't forget what you just said.

Amiya:
Because Rhodes Island will not.

Wei Yenwu:
Naturally.

Amiya:
Blaze, Dr. {@nickname}, let's go.

Amiya:
Ah, by the way, Madam Ch'en, where's Inspector Hoshiguma? I don't see her around. Is she... all right?

Ch'en:
She had some minor injuries, nothing serious.

Amiya:
Oh, I see...

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en, Rhodes Island can also give you a checkup and provide some quick treatment if needed.

Ch'en:
No thanks.

Amiya:
You don't have to worry about anything, our medical procedures are completely confidential.

Ch'en:
A little bit of elbow grease is good enough.

Amiya:
Mm... If you insist, then I won't force you.

Amiya:
In that case, I'll see you later then, Madam Ch'en.

Ch'en:
...

Chief's Office, Upper Lungmen

Swire:
Chief Wei, how was everything on your end?

Wei Yenwu:
Good, of course. Otherwise, I wouldn't have time to chat with you here.

Swire:
Did they agree to slow down the operation?

Wei Yenwu:
Of course, but there is a time limit.

Wei Yenwu:
Today, and tomorrow. If Reunion is still not contained after two days, you know what will happen.

Swire:
Only two days?! That's not enough time! I can't—

Wei Yenwu:
Two days and nights are already too generous. In comparison, I will only give you one day.

Swire:
One day?

Wei Yenwu:
I want you to take care of everything within a day.

Swire:
Chief Wei, if they can help us, we can get rid of Reunion within hours. Wouldn't that minimize our losses?

Wei Yenwu:
That's not important. Lungmen should be able to handle its own problems, once and for all. That is our first principle.

Wei Yenwu:
That is what we need to demonstrate to them. So, everyone, get moving.

Wei Yenwu:
Go, Madam Ch'en. It is time to show Reunion some Lungmen hospitality.

Ch'en:
Understood.

Ch'en:
Chief Wei, I do have one question. Even if you can't answer right now, I hope you can give me a reasonable guess after everything is over.

Wei Yenwu:
You may ask.

Ch'en:
This is supposed to be Reunion's all-out attack. In that case, why has their leader, Talulah, not appeared in Lungmen?

Wei Yenwu:
Hmm...

Fumizuki:
I thought things were progressing smoothly. Why are you frowning, then?

Wei Yenwu:
Have we received any response from Ursus?

Fumizuki:
Still nothing.

Wei Yenwu:
And we still can't get in contact with Speaker Witte?

Fumizuki:
Unfortunately, our messenger hasn't even been able to meet him.

Wei Yenwu:
By the looks of things, the Ursus Empire is completely opaque.

Wei Yenwu:
Fumizuki, I have a premonition. That this whole thing is just the start of something much bigger.

Fumizuki:
The last time I heard you say that was many years ago.

Wei Yenwu:
When did I say that? I've completely forgotten why I would say something like that.

Fumizuki:
That was right after we first met. Are you saying that you've forgotten about everything that's ever happened between us?

Wei Yenwu:
N-no way! How could I! I just can't remember most things apart from our time together.

Fumizuki:
Nice try, you sweet-talker. Unfortunately, this isn't something you'll be able to forget.

Fumizuki:
You said this to my face twenty years ago... that if we lost, this city would be under a different name, and become just another stepping stone on the path to Ursus hegemony.

Fumizuki:
If we had lost, you wouldn't be the one sitting here. He would.

Wei Yenwu:
...

Wei Yenwu:
Duke of Kashchey.

Fumizuki:
Alas, poor Tal. Don't you think she reminds us of him?

Wei Yenwu:
But he's already dead.

Wei Yenwu:
Killed by Talulah herself.
