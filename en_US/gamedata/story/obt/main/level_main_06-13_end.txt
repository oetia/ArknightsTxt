Amiya:
......

Amiya:
(Blaze. I need you to lead the team to seize the advantage.)

Blaze:
(You want to organize a raid?)

Amiya:
(I'm very worried about our current situation.)

Amiya:
(Both we and the Yetis have used our respective skills to locate the Doctor and FrostNova. Thanks to your Arts, they are now safe.)

Amiya:
(And... The two are very close. If you can save one, you can save the other.)

Amiya:
(There are two things we can't be sure of right now.)

Amiya:
(First, who will reach them first...?)

Blaze:
(Second, FrostNova's attitude.)

Amiya:
(Exactly.)

Amiya:
(If we get the initiative, we'll have to subdue FrostNova immediately. But we also have to trade her for Yeti Squad's cooperation.)

Amiya:
(That way, we avoid fighting, and also deepen the opportunity for communication.)

Amiya:
(But if they get there first...)

Jessica:
Um, Amiya, the heartbeat detector found something. We have a position, but we don't know the depth...

Amiya:
Right!

Blaze:
Hey... Wait!

Blaze:
Where's the fire? Aww.

Meteorite:
As soon as the Doctor comes up, she gets all panicky and forgets herself.

Meteorite:
I'm not sure if this is a bug in Amiya or a feature...

Blaze:
You know, the stuff she just said, that's not like her at all. She came up with it too fast.

Meteorite:
At least she didn't come around to a sneak attack. This one's on us.

Blaze:
Not quite. If we ambushed them, the Yetis would just fight to the death.

Blaze:
I'm here to rescue you all, not cause more casualties. She didn't give up on her winning outcome.

Meteorite:
...I guess I should apologize. It's the mercenary in me.

Blaze:
You didn't do it, did you?

Blaze:
Keeping a level head after her victories and keeping to her tactical goals are what makes me trust Amiya as field commander.

Blaze:
I'm gonna go check on the Yetis.

Meteorite:
Huh?

Yeti #1:
This structure... It's so complicated. It makes my head hurt.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Describe it to me and I'll draw it up.

Yeti #1:
Huh? I didn't even finish my eighth grade textbook in middle school. Give me a break.

Yeti Squad Member B:
What did you do instead of class again?

Yeti #1:
I went to train.

Yeti #1:
Why not let Nesti try? He's got some Arts, doesn't he?

Yeti Squad Member B:
He's all about reciting poetry and writing essays. That's not your structural probing business.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Well, why not try to express it through numbers?

Yeti #1:
Good idea. I'm okay at math. Let's try it.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Does it feel hot to you?

Yeti #1:
No. I'm wearing this thick heavy thing and even so I still feel Sister's Originium freezing my skin off...

Yeti #1:
Oh.

Yeti #1:
Hi, Rhodes Island cat.

Blaze:
Sorry, but when I sweat, the air around me heats up, and then I just keep sweating.

Blaze:
Thanks to you guys, I'm feeling a lot cooler than usual.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Are you nervous?

Blaze:
A little. I never thought I'd be working with the enemy.

Yeti Squad Member B:
For now, at least, we aren't enemies. After digging out our Sister, we'll do what she says. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

Blaze:
...You guys really aren't anything like the other Reunion folks.

Yeti Squad Member B:
You think the rest of Reunion is all the same? Are you and the bunny the same?

Blaze:
Hey, yeah. Good point. We've got all kinds on our side.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Everyone's got all kinds.

Yeti #1:
At least you're willing to listen to us. The Ursus soldiers all just shoot us on sight.

Yeti #1:
The arrows start flying and they don't stop until one side is dead.

Blaze:
Good thing we're a pharmaceutical company and not a bunch of Ursus soldiers.

Yeti #1:
Do pharmaceutical companies all have equipment like yours?

Blaze:
The world is a dangerous place and we have to protect ourselves, right?

Yeti #1:
It would be nice if you spent your time farming instead of battling.

Yeti #1:
If you can grow a harvest of red wheat, you'll feed half a town's starving Infected.

Yeti #1:
If they weren't starving, they wouldn't have gone into that little town. Then they wouldn't have been shot.

Yeti #1:
If only.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Enough of that.

Blaze:
He's pretty sentimental. You know, I think all Ursus are pretty sentimental.

Yeti Squad Member C:
No slacking off!

Yeti #1:
Oops, sorry. Time to get back to work.

Blaze:
No big deal. Go back to your work.

Blaze:
But that thing you're carrying, it's got a powerful smell.

Yeti #1:
Oh? This...? I...

Yeti Squad Member C:
What's she talking about?

Blaze:
Nothing. Don't worry.

Blaze:
Hey, a mite peckish.

Yeti Squad Member C:
Oh...?

Yeti #1:
What are you looking at me for?

15:22 P.M.

Ruins of Chernobog 'District 14'

Sector Surface

3 hours into the excavation operation

Meteorite:
Amiya, stop!

Meteorite:
Your fingers are bleeding! Stop digging with your hands!

Amiya:
But... I can feel something down there... Right down here!

Amiya:
I can't feel it if I'm using a tool... I have to use my fingers to pick up on that tiny whisper of a feeling...

Meteorite:
Amiya!

Amiya:
It's close!

Blaze:
(Meteorite...)

Meteorite:
(But...)

Blaze:
(Leave her be.)

Amiya:
If we let them get there first...

Yeti #1:
It's okay, you can do it!

Yeti Squad Member D:
Use Arts! I- I can't. I really can't!

Yeti #1:
We can do this even without our Sister, right? Hurry up and make the temperatures nice and different. The bigger the difference, the better!

Yeti Squad Member D:
I'll try... But don't blame me if it doesn't work!

Yeti Squad Member B:
Who else can we blame besides you...?

Yeti Squad Member C:
Don't tease him. He has to concentrate.

Amiya:
Here! Right here!

Amiya:
...A wall? Did I get it wrong?

Amiya:
Just smash it! Break through...!

Amiya:
But if it collapses, I...

Amiya:
I... got it wrong.

Yeti #1:
It's open!

Amiya:
......!

Amiya:
Blaze! Meteorite!

Meteorite:
On it.

Blaze:
Get ready.

FrostNova:
Said I won't lose.

Yeti #1:
Sister!

Yeti #1:
.....This one......

Yeti #1:
This is the one they call the Doctor.

FrostNova:
The leader of Rhodes Island.

Amiya:
That's me. You can call me Amiya.

Meteorite:
(Her rings... are turning red?)

Blaze:
......!

Meteorite:
(Aren't you going to stop her?)

Blaze:
(Why would I stop our only chance at winning?)

Meteorite:
Blaze!

Blaze:
I respect Amiya's decision.

Amiya:
Doctor!

FrostNova:
Nesti, is Rhodes Island not fighting you?

Nesti:
They're not.

FrostNova:
Then here on this battlefield, we are not enemies.

Amiya:
FrostNova...

FrostNova:
There is no reason to fight if we are not enemies.

FrostNova:
Go back, Doctor, to your people.

Yeti #1:
...Our Sister is so magnanimous.

Yeti Squad Member B:
Like she needs your approval.

FrostNova:
Quiet down.

FrostNova:
Little rabbit.

Amiya:
Uh, my name is Amiya...

FrostNova:
You're going to Lungmen too, aren't you?

Amiya:
...That's right.

FrostNova:
Then we will be enemies before long, little rabbit. Just, not yet.

Amiya:
FrostNova, you and your team aren't as destructive as the other Reunion units.

FrostNova:
Don't blame my people. You don't know what they've been through.

Amiya:
But you don't want them to go on like this!

FrostNova:
...Oh?

FrostNova:
It seems you can read my mind?

Amiya:
I can't. But I do sense your unease and your consternation.

FrostNova:
All of this will be swept away after the fall of Lungmen.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island, we can honestly understand you and your squad.

Amiya:
You may think I'm wrong, and that we don't understand you at all...

Amiya:
But FrostNova, ma'am, I know exactly what you've been through.

FrostNova:
......Childish.

FrostNova:
......

FrostNova:
They're not. This was once the cloak of the 'Patriot.' I wove it into a coat.

Amiya:
......Oh......

FrostNova:
How can you tell?

FrostNova:
Never mind...

FrostNova:
......

FrostNova:
Everyone has some things they can't say, I suppose.

Amiya:
FrostNova, Rhodes Island does not seek out conflict. We want to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

FrostNova:
And which bloodshed was necessary?

Amiya:
At the very least, we don't want to fight your squad!

Amiya:
They are all good, decent people. We absolutely cannot hurt them, or let them hurt innocent people!

FrostNova:
...Then you must pray we do not meet again.

Amiya:
FrostNova!

FrostNova:
I think I don't much want to hurt you either. But if I have to, I will kill you all.

FrostNova:
Then you can try to beat me.

FrostNova:
Defeat me in battle, and I will consider it.

FrostNova:
But of course, once we meet on the battlefield, we are enemies. And as enemies, we will fight to the death.

Amiya:
......

FrostNova:
Oh yes. This one, for the fox.

Frostleaf:
...What?

FrostNova:
A special remedy for frostbite. One-of-a-kind recipe. It relieves the burning and pain.

FrostNova:
I've studied these things for a long time. And you fought very well back there.

FrostNova:
Warriors willing to sacrifice themselves are the strongest, in my eyes.

Frostleaf:
......

Frostleaf:
Thank you.

Amiya:
FrostNova...

Blaze:
Hey, wait. I have something to say too.

Blaze:
Yeti #1!

Yeti #1:
Oh... huh?

FrostNova:
......?

FrostNova:
What's happening?

Blaze:
Let's get a drink next time! Your vodka smells great!

Yeti #1:
Don't say that out loud!

FrostNova:
......

FrostNova:
Hm.

FrostNova:
Haha...

FrostNova:
Goodbye, Rhodes Island.

FrostNova:
I hope we never meet again.

Lungmen Substructure

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
Here you are, after all.

FrostNova:
......

FrostNova:
Hello, Rhodes Island.
