Child:
Ahh...! Look out!

Amiya:
Ouch!

Child:
S-sorry, I didn't mean to run into you...

Amiya:
Don't worry about it. You're very polite.

Child:
Ehehe...

Child:
Um, ma'am, what are you doing here?

Child:
It's still raining. You're not going to go inside?

Amiya:
Ah, um... I'm just... taking a walk.

Amiya:
Are you looking for help?

Child:
Oh! How'd you know?!

Amiya:
I can't tell you~ It's a secret.

Child:
Aw... it's fine though!

Child:
Ma'am, do you think...

Child:
Hmm... that probably won't work. You're a bit too short...

Amiya:
Hey, you shouldn't say stuff like that! You're shorter than me!

Child:
Whoa!

Child:
W-well, we could try... Um, could you help me move that board? Let's do it together!

Child:
There's a record player under that metal rack. I want to take it back home.

Amiya:
Sure.

Child:
1... 2... 3! Together!

Amiya:
We did it!

Amiya:
...

Child:
Woah, you're really strong, ma'am! Thank you!

Amiya:
But... this record player is broken.

Child:
It's okay! It's always been broken.

Child:
But one day, I'll be able to fix it. I collected a lot of records, but I've never listened to them before...

Child:
...But one day, I'll play them for everyone!

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...Such a difficult thing, said so casually...

Amiya:
...What am I doing this for... What can I even do...

Child:
Ma'am, you're not scared of me?

Amiya:
...Scared of what?

Child:
I'm an Infected!

Amiya:
Haha... I am too.

Child:
What?! That's such a pity. You're so pretty, too...!

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
There's nothing wrong with being an Infected. Whether you are healthy or infected...

Amiya:
If you're a good person, that will never change.

Child:
Huh...? I don't get it...

Child:
(Grrrrrr...)

Amiya:
...Are you hungry?

Child:
...Mmhm...

Amiya:
...Here, take this. It's all I have.

Child:
Wow! Thank you, ma'am!

Child:
But... why did you come here?

Amiya:
I...

Amiya:
It's because...

Amiya:
It's because I made a promise to someone.

Child:
Bye bye, ma'am!!

Amiya:
Sure, bye bye!

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Even a child like that... In the end, will just...

Those who were robbed of their identity. The Infected. You've long lost the right to call yourselves people.

Amiya:
What can I accomplish? What more... can I do...?

Amiya:
Why... can I not protect those around me...

You cannot.

Amiya:
No... I...

Famine... Persecution... Death...

These are the only things awaiting the Infected.

Amiya:
No, that's not true...

Amiya:
As long as Rhodes Island is fighting for the Infected...

You are but one of the few lucky ones.

Amiya:
No... We've all come together to fight towards a common goal.

This world has already become cold and callous.

Amiya:
No, not yet...

Amiya:
The Infected can't succumb to despair just yet...

You.

Allow the rage to consume you.

Only then...

Amiya:
I...

Amiya:
No... I won't...

Amiya:
I made a promise...

Amiya:
I made a promise to her...!

Amiya:
...Huh?

Amiya:
Who's that...?

Little Girl:
A big sister once told me that these dolls won't work unless you make them yourself.

Little Girl:
So that's why I'm giving this to you!

Another Girl's Voice:
...

Amiya:
That voice just now...?

Amiya:
!

Amiya:
That silhouette...

Amiya:
Is that Madam Ch'en?

Little Girl:
...

Little Girl:

Little Girl:

Little Girl:

Another Girl's Voice:

Ch'en:

Amiya:

Ch'en:
...

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en...

Ch'en:
... ...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en, what are you doing here?

Amiya:
I thought you were...

Ch'en:
None of your concern.

Ch'en:
This is Lungmen's business, and I will take care of it.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en...

Amiya:
This is the first time...

Amiya:
I've seen that look in her eyes...
