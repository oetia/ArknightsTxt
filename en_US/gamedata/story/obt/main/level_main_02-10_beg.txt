Franka:
Liskarm Are you able to hold the line?

Liskarm:
I'm fine over here!

Liskarm:
Franka, watch out for an enemy flank!

Franka:
There's no end to them...!

Reunion Member:
You don't have a chance of breaking through our defenses!

Reunion Member:
I'm going to smash you...

Reunion Member:
Guh?!

Reunion Member:
A-aaaagh!

Reunion Member:
Wh-what is that? !

Franka:
It's a thermite blade.

Franka:
Does slicing count as breaking as well?

Franka:
What a pain...

Franka:
Medic! There's someone injured here!

Franka:
Be careful when transporting them!

Medic:
I got it!

Franka:
Amiya!

Franka:
How's the situation over there?

Liskarm:
I think we have a little issue here.

Amiya:
Franka...

Amiya:
The enemy leader... just showed up in front of me and Liskarm!

Skullshatterer:
...

Skullshatterer:
Where else do you plan on hiding?

Skullshatterer:
You can't escape us, Rhodes Island.

Skullshatterer:
I'll grind you to dust...

Skullshatterer:
...not even your bones will remain.

Skullshatterer:
You traitors... have turned your backs on the Infected!

Franka:
Oh~ This one's finally decided to show up.

Franka:
Doesn't sound too impressive, though.

Liskarm:
Amiya, seems like we--

Franka:
Ack, it's a dead end!

Franka:
Did I run too far ahead? !

Liskarm:
Franka's also having some problems...

Liskarm:
Reunion has us cornered.

Amiya:
...

Liskarm:
We'll have to fight.

Liskarm:
I feel that... we more than match up against them.

Liskarm:
We just have to get a bit more serious...

Franka:
Liskarm, you just don't understand.

Franka:
Whatever level of power we choose to display, we can't let the L.G.D. feel threatened.

Liskarm:
But we can't just sit here and let them run over us!

Liskarm:
Defenders, hold your ground!

Skullshatterer:
A leader of Rhodes Island, eh...

Skullshatterer:
You're an Infected, but you still assist Lungmen in their slaughter of other Infected!

Skullshatterer:
You have blood of so many of my comrades on your hands!

Skullshatterer:
Stand and face me!

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Reunion...

Amiya:
You were the ones who started the hatred, the pain, and the violence...

Amiya:
You were the ones who started all this in Chernobog!!
