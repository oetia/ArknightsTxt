Franka:
Amiya! Hurry!

Amiya:
Miss Misha! Please follow us!

Misha:
...How... can this be...

Texas:
This way, hurry!

Franka:
This area is clear! Be careful, they're still after us!

Misha:
...

Misha:
Are they also...?

Amiya:
Yes...

Amiya:
Reunion...

Amiya:
They're also... Infected.

Misha:
...

Misha:
Why?

Misha:
Why are the Infected fighting each other...

Skullshatterer:
...

Reunion Member:
Skullshatterer...

Reunion Member:
You... let them go?

Skullshatterer:
Don't worry...

Skullshatterer:
They can't run.

Skullshatterer:
But I've finally found her-- No, no...

Skullshatterer:
She's finally... come to me...

Reunion Member:
...

Texas:
We've arrived.

Franka:
...Are you serious?

Texas:
That's what the markings say.

Franka:
But... this route is heading up, isn't it?

Franka:
How's that going to help us?

Exusiai:
Amiya, Amiya! Up here, that's right, come up here!

Amiya:
--Exusiai!

Amiya:
Are you certain...?

Exusiai:
Trust me, I wouldn't mess up~

Exusiai:
I know Lungmen's roads like the back of my hand!

Amiya:
Aha...

Texas:
Let's head up.

Franka:
Wouldn't that be... waiting for the enemy to surround us?

Exusiai:
If you don't hurry and Reunion finds us, maybe!

Franka:
Tch... Wait, you guys go first...

Franka:
I'll go weld the gate's entrance so Reunion can't get in.

Amiya:
There's a penguin logo on the staircase here. Is this the place?

Exusiai:
Sure is. Head forward and take a left, then take the stairs up.

Amiya:
That will take us inside the building...

Amiya:
Weren't we going to go underground?

Exusiai:
No, no, I just said we were heading upstairs.

Liskarm:
...Upstairs?

Liskarm:
Are you sure... she's trustworthy?

Texas:
'As long as we get to the destination, any route can be taken.' That's one of our mottos here at Penguin Logistics.

Texas:
Just try our service once. You'll love it.

Liskarm:
...

Amiya:
*gasp*... *gasp*...

Amiya:
Sorry, Misha... I didn't know...

Misha:
...

Texas:
Phew...

Texas:
Hey, you.

Texas:
Are you Dr. {@nickname} of Rhodes Island?

Texas:
You don't seem to like climbing stairs.
