Meteorite:
Frostleaf, watch out! Don't rush so far forward!

Frostleaf:
I know what I'm doing!

Reunion Member:
Aaah! Aaaagghhh!

Reunion Member:
She sliced through the shield using a blade of frigid air?

Reunion Member:
Wh-what?!

Frostleaf:
Get lost!

Meteorite:
Amiya! Frostleaf has broken the enemy's formation, and is now charging towards their commander!

Amiya:
Snipers, casters, I need you to cover Frostleaf!

Mephisto:
Ohh...?

Mephisto:
And just what do you want, little fox?

Frostleaf:
I want you to scream and beg. I want you to pay...

Frostleaf:
...with your life.

Amiya:
Out of my way!

Reunion Member:
Woah!

Reunion Member:
B-Black Arts...

Reunion Member:
H-hurry, run for it!

Reunion Member:
I don't want to end up like Mephisto's minions...!

Amiya:
Mephisto, we're not letting you get away!

Mephisto:
Heh. I should have guessed that these goons weren't enough to stop you.

Amiya:
You're going to pay for what you've done, you sick bastard!

Frostleaf:
You can't escape.

Mephisto:
Little fox, you're getting a bit too close for comfort.

Frostleaf:
Because I am the one who will take your life.

Frostleaf:
Those who do not respect the sanctity of life...

Frostleaf:
Do not deserve on of their own.

Mephisto:
Hehhh...

Mephisto:
Is that so.

Frostleaf:
?!

Frostleaf:
What... My feet...?

Meteorite:
Amiya! Reunion forces are appearing from all directions! Even though there aren't a lot of them...

Meteorite:
...

Meteorite:
Oh no, it's the Yeti Squadron...

Meteorite:
They've all... come together!

Mephisto:
All right, I need to introduce you to a new friend.

Mephisto:
Ahem~ Next up, put your hands together for the real star of the show...

Mephisto:
The nightmare of the northwest tundra, the master of the Yetis...

Mephisto:
Miss... Frost... Novaaaaaaa!

Mephisto:
She will freeze every bit of your flesh, every drop of your blood...

Mephisto:
Bit. By. Bit!

Amiya:
...We need to get out of here...!

FrostNova:
...

FrostNova:
Mephisto...

FrostNova:
I should have left you to slowly freeze to death in the tundra like the psychopath you are.

Mephisto:
Oh my, scary, scary~

Mephisto:
But Rhodes Island is right in front of us.

Amiya:
Frostleaf...

Amiya:
Back up.

Frostleaf:
...

Frostleaf:
Amiya, take them with you.

Amiya:
I refuse!

Amiya:
That person... that person is...!

Frostleaf:
She's... coming towards me.

Frostleaf:
We can't win.

Frostleaf:
Hah... Even though I would've liked to live a bit longer...

Frostleaf:
I'm glad that I had the chance to meet all of you.

Frostleaf:
Hurry.

Amiya:
Frostleaf?!

Frostleaf:
Hurry!

FrostNova:
...

FrostNova:
Don't worry, Rhodes Island.

FrostNova:
I'll give you a painless death.
