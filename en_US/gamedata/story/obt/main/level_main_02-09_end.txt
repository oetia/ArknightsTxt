Amiya:
This is the last wave of pursuers!

Reunion Member:
...Aaargh!

Liskarm:
All clear!

Liskarm:
Confirming that it's safe over here!

Franka:
Where's the enemy commander?

Liskarm:
...Not with their main force.

Franka:
The enemy is lurking... we're being followed and watched.

Franka:
Are they trying to wear us down until they have the perfect opportunity to strike?

Amiya:
Reunion is no stranger to sneak attacks.

Amiya:
We learned this the hard way at Chernobog.

Amiya:
Let's fall back quickly...

Liskarm:
I can't guarantee the safety of the escape route.

Liskarm:
We'll be in danger if they start demolishing the nearby buildings to block the road.

Amiya:
Hurry, let's see what other routes we can take. The stealthier, the better!

Liskarm:
Amiya, how about taking that staircase to our 4 o'clock down?

Franka:
That's a difficult route.

Reunion Member:
Aaargh! Rhodes Island!

Amiya:
It's an ambush! Watch out!

Skullshatterer:
Continue the chase.

Skullshatterer:
Don't give them any room to breathe.

Misha:
Madam...

Misha:
There are some Infected kids... still in the slums.

Misha:
If possible...

Misha:
I hope that you can take care of them...

Ch'en:
Our duty is to protect Lungmen.

Ch'en:
The Infected are not considered citizens of Lungmen.

Misha:
...

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
However, citizens or not, the Infected still belong to Lungmen.

Ch'en:
I have no obligation to promise you anything, but I will perform my duty.

Ch'en:
After all...

Misha:
They said they used to...

Ch'en:
It's something we've always been doing.

Misha:
...

Misha:
Thank you...

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
Do you know why we've been searching for you?

Misha:
...I'm not sure.

Misha:
I can't think of any reason why you'd want me.

Misha:
But I have a feeling...

Misha:
That this isn't about me...

Misha:
...It's about my parents.

Ch'en:
...Yes.

Ch'en:
Your father was the most famous scientist in Chernobog.

Ch'en:
As well as one of the most important political figures there.

Ch'en:
Perhaps, there's something you might know...

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
But even if that isn't the case...

Ch'en:
We cannot allow you to fall into Reunion's hands.

W:
Hehe. I've found you, L.G.D.

W:
Don't take this personally...

W:
But I have a very interesting plot in my hands.

W:
To make things more entertaining, I'll need you all to participate.

W:
Now, let us begin.
