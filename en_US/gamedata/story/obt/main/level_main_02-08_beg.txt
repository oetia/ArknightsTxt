Amiya:
Franka, Liskarm, be aware of our surroundings.

Amiya:
I'll take Misha to Madam Ch'en.

Misha:
...

Ch'en:
You're late again.

Ch'en:
Lungmen doesn't want any more security risks.

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en, our escort team was attacked multiple times by Reunion.

Amiya:
In fact, they're still around as we speak.

Amiya:
It's not safe here. Please take Misha and leave as soon as possible.

Ch'en:
And you're Misha?

Misha:
I am...

Ch'en:
From now on, you will follow the L.G.D.'s arrangements.

Ch'en:
PC94172, you're in charge of this girl.

L.G.D. Agent:
Come with me.

Misha:
Amiya...

Amiya:
It's fine.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en, I don't know what Lungmen needs her for...

Amiya:
But I hope that you can ensure her safety.

Ch'en:
We already treat the Infected very well.

Amiya:
I see...

Amiya:
But, Misha is not in good health.

Amiya:
We hope that Lungmen will allow her to live in Rhodes Island after this.

Ch'en:
...I'll send an application to Chief Wei.

Ch'en:
Lungmen will transfer her to Rhodes Island if she passes our checks with no other issues.

Ch'en:
...That is, if there aren't any problems.

Ch'en:
It shouldn't take long.

Amiya:
Understood.

Amiya:
...We'll part ways for the time being, Misha.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island welcomes you.

Misha:
...

Misha:
Amiya, while I'm gone, please protect those kids in the slums.

Amiya:
Huh?

Amiya:
...Oh, that's right.

Amiya:
No problem, you have my promise!

Amiya:
By the way, Misha...

Misha:
Hmm?

Amiya:
Next time, could you teach me... how to make dolls?

Misha:
...Hehe.

Misha:
Mm, sure.

Franka:
Is our mission over now?

Texas:
Rhodes Island will have their hands tied the more they get dragged into all this.

Franka:
But, Lungmen is still keeping a lot of secrets from us.

Liskarm:
Lungmen doesn't seem to care about us too much...

Liskarm:
But the opposite seems to be true for Reunion.

Liskarm:
...

Liskarm:
Amiya.

Liskarm:
The enemy wants to attack the district we're staying at.

Franka:
Even though I've heard about it, Lungmen's architecture sure is complex!

Franka:
This entire street is actually built on rooftops...

Franka:
...and that's giving our enemies a huge advantage to exploit!

Amiya:
Reunion is attacking again...!

Amiya:
They've even chased us all the way out here?!

Amiya:
Why do they... want Misha so badly?
