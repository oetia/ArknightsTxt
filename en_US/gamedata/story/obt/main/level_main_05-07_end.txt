Ch'en:
Medics, former South Paci Plaza, exit 12. One injured, a senior L.G.D. inspector. Get here quickly.

Ch'en:
Has the bleeding stopped?

Hoshiguma:
You should know me by now. The wound has closed, but I won't be able to lift my shield for a while.

Hoshiguma:
How are our colleages doing?

Ch'en:
We were the only ones who fell. I consider that a small win.

Hoshiguma:
You're really not bringing me with you? Reunion's commander may well be hiding inside the L.G.D. Headquarters. It's going to be a brutal fight.

Ch'en:
I'm aware. But considering your condition, it's for the best. Wouldn't you agree?

Hoshiguma:
Hearing you say that stings a bit, but it's fine. I know better.

Hoshiguma:
Remember, be careful out there.

Ch'en:
I know.

Hoshiguma:
No matter how you look at it, Reunion is weaker than we expected. Despite that, they still managed to take Chernobog.

Hoshiguma:
Also, you have a weak point. I can't stress this enough, but never let your thoughts consume you. Ever.

Hoshiguma:
Don't be so obsessed with something that you neglect the other possibilities. There is nothing out there worth going off to battle for, except for your continued existence.

Ch'en:
I'll treat this as your advice to me. I'll take it to heart.

Ch'en:
Hurry up and get better. I'll be waiting for your return after this mission is finished.

Hoshiguma:
I'll protect the medic team. You should get going.

Ch'en:
Sure.

Radio Operator:
...

Radio Operator:
Reunion has already passed the Causeway Bell.

Radio Operator:
Report from AU7: Reunion is also assembling in Ha Wan. I repeat, Reunion is currently assembling. This is AU7's mission briefing.

Radio Operator:
Squad AO3 has eliminated the Reunion forces in Front Bay as planned. They are now pushing the remnants back towards the L.G.D. Headquarters.

Radio Operator:
All enemies in front of Scorpio Palace have been annihilated. Now retreating towards Charles Avenue to head to the rally point. This is Squad AL1's report, over.

Radio Operator:
...

Radio Operator:
These are the updates on Reunion's movements and each squad's progress.

Radio Operator:
Over.

Ch'en:
Understood.

Ch'en:
Continue the operation. Our objective is to drive all Reunion forces into the designated area.

Ch'en:
If small groups of stragglers are seen in other districts, you are authorized to eliminate them.

Ch'en:
Try to draw them out if possible. Focus on avoiding casualties. We'll need to preserve our strength.

Radio Operator:
Yes ma'am.

Ch'en:
Phew...

Ch'en:
Hmm? Another call?

Swire:
Hello, hello? Is this Ah Ch'en? Are you still there?

Ch'en:
What did you call me?!

Swire:
Ah Ch'en. You're done for! You're so dead for what happened at Paci Plaza. I heard it myself - you were the one who gave those orders!

Ch'en:
Is that all you wanted to say?

Swire:
Look, why did you reject Rhodes Island's help? Was it because you felt guilty?

Ch'en:
I don't recall you being a psychologist.

Swire:
Don't worry, I'll help you make reparations.

Ch'en:
Reparations?

Swire:
Hehe, I can't tell you yet.

Swire:
But, you're so done for because of what you did!

Ch'en:
By the way, do you still remember that one restaurant in Sheung Wan?

Swire:
Huh? Which one? Well, whichever one it is, they're all closed now!

Swire:
Wait... are you trying to change the subject?!

Ch'en:
The one with that absolutely divine steak sandwich.

Swire:
Huh? Oh... OHH! I just remembered! The restaurant with a steak burger as big as your palms put side by side!

Ch'en:
That's the one.

Swire:
I used to go there quite often while on my patrols... Get down! Who said you could stand up?!

???:
Aaah!!

Swire:
What was that place called again? Goodie Foodie?

Ch'en:
Sounds about right.

Swire:
Aha, now I get it. You're going to treat me to a meal, aren't you? But why don't we go to some place a bit more high-class?

Ch'en:
Your idea of 'high-class' is very different from mine.

Swire:
Come on, I can foot the bill.

Ch'en:
Miss S, do you really think I'm that kind of person?

Swire:
Do you want to try calling me that again?

Ch'en:
Sorry, I bit my tongue.

Swire:
You clearly did that on purpose!

Ch'en:
Swire, I was just thinking... If we don't do a better job this time, we won't be able to face the locals.

Ch'en:
Our businesses depend on Lungmen, and Lungmen also depends on them.

Swire:
If you feel that way, you should stop running your mouth. The sooner we take down Reunion, the sooner you can treat me to brunch.

Ch'en:
Seems like the fighting is pretty intense on your end as well?

Swire:
Ah, it's fine. I can handle it.

???:
Quick! They're about to get away!

Swire:
How annoying! Hey, hurry it up! We don't have all day!

Swire:
Ah Ch'en! I want a steak, tomato, and egg burger!

Ch'en:
No problem.

Ch'en:
Sorry for accidentally locking you up in the vault that other time.

Swire:
You call that an accident? ! I know you did that on purpose! Whatever, it felt cathartic splashing water all over you this morning, so I guess we're even.

Swire:
Hey, Ah Ch'en.

Ch'en:
Hmm?

Swire:
Safety first. Don't throw your life away for the sake of what's immediately in front of you. Remember that there are lots of people who are counting on you.

Ch'en:
Hmph, is that so. Thanks for your advice.

Swire:
Now that you're in front of the restaurant, that means you're almost at the L.G.D. Headquarters, right?

Ch'en:
That's right.

Swire:
Good luck.

7:40 P.M. \ Overcast

670m east of L.G.D. Headquarters, Upper Factor St., Upper Lungmen

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en, Fourth Mobile Squad reporting in.

Ch'en:
Good work.

Ch'en:
All of you assembled here are the cream of the crop. As we speak, many of our colleagues are still out there fighting. But we have our own mission.

Ch'en:
The building in front of us used to be the symbol of Lungmen's safety â€” the embodiment of law and order, the heart of the L.G.D.

Ch'en:
But now, it has fallen into Reunion's hands, and has been tainted by conspiracy and warfare.

Ch'en:
Some of you might see this as just another job. Some of you might be saddened, while others might be enraged.

Ch'en:
No matter how you feel, we are the L.G.D. We aren't rioters, nor are we criminals.

Ch'en:
We will take back our headquarters, not necessarily for the sake of pride or justice.

Ch'en:
We will do it because we are the L.G.D., and we will take back what belongs to us. That's the only reason we need.

Ch'en:
Do not make Lungmen worry about us. Do I make myself clear?! Obedience, diligence, and perseverance!

Ch'en:
It's time. Let us rid the L.G.D. Headquarters of every last Reunion member!

L.G.D. Agent:
Yes ma'am!

Ch'en:
Let's go.
