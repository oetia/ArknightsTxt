Port 309, Sudean Borough, Londinium

Amiya:
The port... is right ahead.

Amiya:
Hm... Actually, things have been going pretty well so far...

Amiya:
With one exception.

Amiya:
Doctor, the Messenger who's been in contact with you and Dr. Kal'tsit should've reached out to us as soon as we arrived at the adjacent plate.

Amiya:
We're just waiting here... with our hands tied behind our backs.

Amiya:
I thought we'd be able to see her in person, or at least get some kind of message.

Amiya:
Doctor, I can't say any more about our current situation to the other operators.

Amiya:
We've already gotten this far, so we can only keep moving forward.

Amiya:
If we can't get in touch, we can't know for sure.

Amiya:
But I can only hope that nothing happened to her...

Amiya:
We'll enter the city as we originally planned.

Amiya:
Ugh, look at how long that line is. They're all coming from the direction of the city...

Londinium Citizen A:
We're really going to run away like this?

Londinium Citizen B:
This way's safe. My neighbor's whole family left this way last week.

Londinium Citizen B:
As long as we've applied for an exit permit, the soldiers won't give us any trouble.

Londinium Citizen A:
That... That's not what I meant.

Londinium Citizen B:
I know. We're thinking the same thing.

Londinium Citizen B:
Four years ago was when I first heard about the Sarkaz army on the news. Didn't think much of it back then.

Londinium Citizen A:
Yeah, same here. With Her Majesty gone, everything's turned to shit. Who could've expected that some duke would invite the devils into the army on a whim?

Londinium Citizen B:
Two years ago, I saw Sarkaz troops walking down the streets of Trenfield. Everyone was talking about it as we walked home from work.

Londinium Citizen A:
I also remember... It was as if things quietly changed overnight. Those of us who lived by the duke's estate in Camden wouldn't see these changes until a bit later.

Londinium Citizen B:
Something like half a year ago, the Sarkaz army stood in front of our bank. They took away our manager because her husband held an important position in the city's defense forces.

Londinium Citizen A:
Whew. Did you ever see them again? The police force in our estate was replaced with all new faces, plenty with horrible horns on top.

Londinium Citizen B:
And then there's... yesterday. I saw the Sarkaz going to the corner opposite my home. They were... knocking on doors.

Londinium Citizen A:
So that's why you decided to flee?

Londinium Citizen B:
Actually, my parents left a long time ago. I just... couldn't put down my banker's salary.

Londinium Citizen A:
None of us wanted this. Londinium... If we leave, we'll never be able to go back to our old lives, right?

Londinium Citizen B:
Let's not worry about that for now. We should get going. I'd rather stay alive than make money.

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
Is it like this every day?

Siege:
More or less, since a certain point.

Amiya:
Theresis's army... They're not stopping the civilians from leaving the city?

Siege:
By the looks of things, he doesn't seem to care about letting outsiders know who holds the reins of power in Londinium now.

Siege:
I'd assume they always have an eye on Londinium, which is why they have troops stationed outside the city.

Siege:
But they're more concerned about watching each others' moves.

Siege:
For the dukes who've been trying to get into Londinium, whoever gets ahead in taking down the Sarkaz inside the city will gain the upper hand in this power struggle that has lasted over twenty years.

Siege:
Who would want to see the throne claimed by someone else, when in their minds, it rightfully belongs to them?

Siege:
The way things are now, anything a duke might pull can be stopped by a few messages, an invitation to a party, or even a little bad news from their own demesne.

Siege:
And even if one of them decided to march on the city, they'd be walking right into a defeat. The Sarkaz regent wouldn't lose a single man.

Siege:
I'm not sure.

Siege:
When we left Londinium, the city seemed like it did on any ordinary day.

Siege:
And I always figured that if Parliament could convene for a day, nothing too crazy could happen to Londinium.

Siege:
As for the specifics of what's going on inside the city, we won't know until we see for ourselves.

Londinium Citizen:
Excuse me, I've brought you all the way here... You'll be able to go the rest of the way on your own, right?

Amiya:
Yes, sure. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. You've done us a great favor.

Amiya:
All squads, listen up. Follow the plan and mingle with the flow of traffic ahead in batches––

Amiya:
Closure's squad will go first to make sure the road ahead of us is clear. Then Siege's squad will follow up, with me and Doctor's squad behind that.

Amiya:
Recon squad, keep a close eye on our surroundings, and report any abnormalities right away.

Amiya:
Balin, you'll be in charge of taking Mr. Thomas back the same way we came.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Amiya!

Amiya:
What is it?

Rhodes Island Operator:
There's a disturbance up ahead! Looks like Sarkaz fighters incoming!

Amiya:
What?!

Amiya:
Everyone, the infiltration operation is on hold. Take cover, hide yourselves!

Sarkaz Warrior:
......

Sarkaz Warrior:
Grab that one, right there!

Londinium Citizen A:
What... What's going on? Why are the Sarkaz here?

Londinium Citizen A:
Didn't you say this way was safe?!

Sarkaz Warrior:
I'm talking to you. Stop right there!

Londinium Citizen A:
Hurry... Hurry... We're almost out... of the city...

Londinium Citizen A:
Gaaahh––!

Sarkaz Warrior:
......

Sarkaz Warrior:
Wrong one.

Londinium Citizen B:
S-Sir, please... D-Don't hurt me, I'll go... Did we do something wrong?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Go, scurry off. Don't stand here blocking our way.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Listen up, nobody move!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Stop what you're doing and stand still. You, you, and you. Turn around and let me see your face!

Sarkaz Warrior:
What's in your bag? Is it a weapon? Pour everything out and let me see!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Why's there a burn mark on your face? Looks pretty fresh too... Yeah, you. Get out of the line!

Sarkaz Warrior:
You burned your face baking bread? Do you take us for fools?!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Hmph... Guess it really wasn't our weapons. Just to be sure, you're not a rebel, right?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Got too scared and passed out, huh? Whatever, we'll bring this one with us.

Horn:
......

Londinium Citizen?:
Lieutenant, we're stuck here.

Horn:
It's my fault. Before I brought you here, I should've made sure we weren't being followed.

Londinium Citizen?:
Please don't talk like that.

Londinium Citizen?:
We've all been through worse. Whether it's my bunch that got captured by Dublinn, or Old Tom's group who were tortured by the Sarkaz, we were pretty much dead men walking until you rescued us.

Londinium Citizen?:
That really was a taste of despair... I'd rather die in battle than live inside the enemy's cage, powerless and addled.

Horn:
You are not to blame for Londinium's fall, not in the slightest.

Londinium Citizen?:
And you are even less to blame.

Londinium Citizen?:
You were the one who pulled us out of a desperate situation. At least I was able to get here on my own two legs, and got to live an extra hour.

Londinium Citizen?:
I said I didn't have the will to fight anymore, but you didn't blame me. You even risked yourself to bring us here.

Londinium Citizen?:
Leave us, Lieutenant. If you're alone, you can hide. Avoid their line of sight, and find a safe place.

Londinium Citizen?:
We're sickly and chewed up. We'll only slow you down.

Horn:
I'd never leave any of you behind.

Londinium Citizen?:
Hah... If our officers back there were like you, then maybe... we wouldn't have lost so quickly and disastrously.

Londinium Citizen?:
It took meeting you to make me realize that I wanted to make a difference, to be like you...

Horn:
You mean... No, you mustn't!

Londinium Citizen?:
Hey, if the few of us charged at once, how many Sarkaz do you reckon we could take with us?

Horn:
Listen to me, right now.

Horn:
None of you move. That's an order.

Londinium Citizen?:
An order...?

Londinium Citizen?:
Fine. You're my commanding officer right now. I'll obey your orders.

Horn:
We still have a few minutes until we face the Sarkaz.

Horn:
Keep your heads down. Remember what I told you – you're all vagrants from the neighboring estate. You got hurt fighting each other over a piece of bread.

Londinium Citizen?:
You... expect the Sarkaz to buy that?

Horn:
Sudean is a complete mess these days. They've probably seen it all.

Horn:
Doesn't matter if they buy it or not. Even if they try to interrogate you, just... bear with it for a while.

Horn:
And if you can't take it anymore...

Londinium Citizen?:
We understand. If the Sarkaz find out, no one betrays the others.

Horn:
If you can't take it anymore, that's when I'll make my move.

Londinium Citizen?:
Lieutenant...?!

Horn:
Let's wait and see for now.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Nothing over here.

Sarkaz Warrior:
What about over there? There are a few more over there, and behind that elevator too. This damned place has too many hiding spots!

Sarkaz Warrior:
You lot, go take a closer look over there!

Amiya:
Those fighters seem to be looking for someone.

Amiya:
Squads, report your current position.

Amiya:
Positions confirmed.

Amiya:
Seems like it.

Amiya:
Doctor, do you still remember the table-top exercise we did with Dr. Kal'tsit before we left?

Amiya:
One possibility is that the Messengers we had active around Londinium and Victoria all failed.

Amiya:
They didn't have time to provide us with the accurate intel, and Theresis was able to see all our moves.

Amiya:
In that case, Theresis's personal guard would be there waiting for us the moment we set foot in Londinium.

Amiya:
But it doesn't look like that's what's happening...

Amiya:
I think we've more or less reached the same conclusion.

Amiya:
Theresis doesn't know we're here yet. Otherwise, we would've had a very hard time even making it this far.

Amiya:
If that's true, then these Sarkaz fighters up ahead must be searching for someone else who could potentially come this way...

Londinium Citizen:
––!

Amiya:
Huh, Mr. Thomas...?

Rhodes Island Operator:
Amiya, he tried to bolt! I barely managed to stop him!

Londinium Citizen:
No, let me go! I can't stay here...

Amiya:
Mr. Thomas, you'd best not run off on your own! That'd be terribly dangerous!

Amiya:
I promised you I'd send an operator to escort you... I'm really sorry, but that's not something we can do right now...

Rhodes Island Operator:
Ouch!

Amiya:
W-Wait, you can't just take our operator's weapon––!

Londinium Citizen:
Sorry, b-but, I don't want to die!

Amiya:
What's going on here...?

Amiya:
......

Londinium Citizen:
I don't want this either... I was just their driver for six months, that's all!

Londinium Citizen:
They took over my candy plant and forced me to ship things for them. I have a family... what am I supposed to do?!

Londinium Citizen:
That day I took a tiny peek, just one glance. How could I have known what they were doing with my plant?

Londinium Citizen:
They've been chasing me ever since! If they catch me, they're going to kill me for sure!

Londinium Citizen:
Why'd you have me do this anyway... I'm going to die, no matter where I run!

Londinium Citizen:
I... I can't just sit here and wait to die...

Rhodes Island Operator:
Mr. Thomas!

Amiya:
Balin! Don't chase after him, we can't afford to blow our cover.

Londinium Citizen:
Ha... Haha...

Londinium Citizen:
I'll just... keep running away from Londinium... I don't even care about Dublinn anymore...

???:
Huh?

Londinium Citizen:
Eek––!

Dublinn Soldier:
......

Londinium Citizen:
You... How could... You're...

Mandragora:
It's not up to you to decide whether or not you care about Dublinn.

Mandragora:
––Get him.
