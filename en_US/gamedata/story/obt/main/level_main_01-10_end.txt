Dobermann:
We've broken through Reunion's encirclement!

Nearl:
But... they...

Nearl:
... I... Aaaagh...

Dobermann:
Shh...

Dobermann:
...Don't let Amiya hear you.

Nearl:
Amiya's kept a clear head through this! She's a lot more mature than we thought...!

Amiya:
...Ngh...

Amiya:
...Mmh...?

Dobermann:
Even if that's the case, we can't let her hear this!

Dobermann:
We mustn't burden her any further. She's already... carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders.

Dobermann:
...We can't... let their efforts go to waste!

Dobermann:
They made the ultimate choice to let us live, so we have to return the favor... by making sure Amiya and the Doctor return safely.

Nearl:
...

Nearl:
That's right.

Dobermann:
Now isn't the time to be dejected.

Dobermann:
As the Radiant Knight, shouldn't you always be our beacon of hope, no matter what happens?

Nearl:
...

Nearl:
... I'm not sure anymore. But, I will do my part.

Nearl:
Regroup! Don't let your guard down! We're almost there!

Dobermann:
...

Dobermann:
*sigh*...

Dobermann:
Those who told me not to worry... None of them ended up coming back.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Doctor {@nickname}...? What happened...?

Amiya:
P-please... let me down...

Amiya:
Mm, I'm fine. I can walk on my own...

Amiya:
I just... lost consciousness for a little... but I'm okay.

Amiya:
...We managed to make it out?

Amiya:
What about Ace and the others...?

Amiya:
I see.

Amiya:
It's okay. I'm sure Ace will be fine.

Amiya:
Everyone in Rhodes Island is very strong.

Amiya:
We're almost at the south exit. Once we leave Chernobog, we'll be...

Amiya:
We'll... be...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Doctor... Can I... lean on you for a bit...

Amiya:
Just... a little...

Amiya:
...

Talulah:
...

Talulah:
What a pain.

Mephisto:
...

Mephisto:
How did that guy... manage to do this...

Mephisto:
Half of the city was burnt to ashes, the entire plaza became a sea of flames... Steel was melting and reforming...

Mephisto:
But how was he... able to keep fighting?

???:
He fought until the bitter end... Impressive.

Talulah:
I'll remember this.

Talulah:
...Rhodes Island.
