Dobermann:
How could this be...

Dobermann:
What in the world... is going on here?

Reunion Member:
Search all these houses! I want every single room turned inside out!

Female:
Let go of me...! No! You can't...

Reunion Member:
Trying to resist? Too late, you filthy Chernos!

Male:
Just run! Don't worry about me... Save... our child...

Child:
Mama... Mama...!

Ursus Guard:
Forget about the civilians! Hold the line first! There are too many masked goons coming!

Reunion Member:
Don't give the cops any time to rest! Keep attacking!

Ursus Guard:
Where are our reinforcements?! We're going to get overrun...

Reunion Member:
Attack, attack!!

Amiya:
What's going on...? ! Why... Why is Reunion doing this...?

Dobermann:
After all these years, the wolves in sheep's clothing finally bare their fangs.

Medic:
The Infected... they, they're attacking the Ursus troops!

Guard:
But why?! Challenging the Ursus government like this is basically suicide!

Dobermann:
No, look at how fierce this attack is. This must have been a planned operation.

Dobermann:
The place we rescued Doctor from was supposed to be top secret... but they somehow still managed to infiltrate it.

Dobermann:
It's possible that Reunion's attack has already spread through Chernobog in its entirety.

Guard:
No... How, how can that be...

Amiya:
Shhhh!

Reunion Member A:
Have you found any of those fleeing Chernos yet?

Reunion Member B:
I'm still looking!

Reunion Member A:
Good, don't let a single one get away!

Reunion Member A:
Those cold-blooded beasts... I'll make them pay for what they did to my family!

Medic:
(*cough*)

Reunion Member A:
What was that?

Reunion Member B:
Over there!

Medic:
(Mmfh!)

Medic:
(They... they found us...)

Dobermann:
(Shush!)

Medic:
(Mmf...!)

Female:
...Ugh...

Reunion Member A:
Over here! I found 'em!

Female:
...Nooooo!!!!

Female:
Aaah! No, don't...

Reunion Member B:
...!

Reunion Member B:
Hiding in an alley?

Reunion Member B:
Get out.

Female:
Aaaaahh...!

Reunion Member B:
Did you really think we wouldn't find you there...?

Female:
I'm... I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!! Please, at least spare my child!

Reunion Member B:
...

Amiya:
...We need to stop this, now.

Dobermann:
Amiya...

Amiya:
I'm aware of the risk, Instructor Dobermann.

Amiya:
It's just that... we don't have the luxury of sitting around waiting for Reunion to disband.

Amiya:
Additionally, nobody knows how long this situation will last...

Amiya:
Therefore, the best course of action would be to take out the enemy and then get moving. Wouldn't you agree?

Dobermann:
...

Dobermann:
Understood. I'll follow your command.

Dobermann:
All squads, listen up.

Dobermann:
We have the element of surprise - these Reunion members don't know that we're here yet.

Dobermann:
Remember, be decisive! Take them out, cleanly and swiftly.

Dobermann:
Dr. {@nickname}, gather your team. It's time for you to prove yourself.

Dobermann:
We have no more time to second-guess ourselves.

Dobermann:
Hah.

Dobermann:
Amiya, I'm counting on you.

Amiya:
Understood.

Amiya:
'Silent we shall be, should conflict be avoidable--

Amiya:
--but fight tooth and nail, should it be necessary!'

Amiya:
Rhodes Island's creed... has always been the same!
