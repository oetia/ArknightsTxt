Franka:
Phew...

Franka:
L.G.D.'s escort team has managed to leave safely.

Franka:
But... it doesn't look like our enemies have any intention on letting us go.

Amiya:
As long as they don't know that Misha has left with the L.G.D., they'll continue to focus their efforts on us.

Amiya:
Misha will be safer this way.

Liskarm:
Now that I think about it, why are both Reunion and Lungmen after this kid?

Amiya:
I can't say for sure. There are a lot of possibilities.

Amiya:
My best guess is that either she, or something she knows, is significant enough to determine Lungmen's continued safety.

Franka:
Something?

Amiya:
Yes, perhaps some intel or information...

Amiya:
So that's why both Lungmen and Reunion are after her.

Liskarm:
What a dangerous contest...

Amiya:
And none of us can stay out of it, not us, Misha, or the L.G.D.

Franka:
Hopefully we don't end up caught in the crossfire.

Franka:
We don't know anything, but we have to take care of everything...

Amiya:
I, I'm not quite sure...

Amiya:
But as for Madam Ch'en...

Amiya:
I have a hunch... that things aren't going to end so smoothly.

Exusiai:
Amiya, is there anything left for us to do?

Exusiai:
Should we accompany you back to Rhodes Island?

Amiya:
No thank you. Nothing is holding us back in combat anymore, so we should be fine.

Texas:
If that's the case, we'll head back and wait for further orders.

Amiya:
No problem.

Amiya:
Moving forward, I hope you'll continue to keep an eye out on Reunion's movements within Lungmen.

Amiya:
Even though we've handed Misha over to the L.G.D., the fact that Reunion is here... still makes me uneasy.

Exusiai:
Easily done~ We'll be on our way now~

Amiya:
Mhm. I'll leave you to it.

Amiya:
Everyone, we don't know how many more Reunion members there are in hiding.

Amiya:
Make sure to stay prepared and alert.

Amiya:
Next, we'll continue to relocate our operations within these high-rises.

Amiya:
If necessary, we can even use the rooftops.

Amiya:
This way, we'll have a terrain advantage versus having to fight Reunion out in the streets.

Amiya:
If necessary, we'll draw them towards areas that we control!

Operators:
Roger!

Crownslayer:
Talulah.

Crownslayer:
The preparations are complete.

Talulah:
...

Talulah:
It's time to make our move.

Crownslayer:
...

Talulah:
--Speak.

Crownslayer:
There actually is a strategic purpose for us to attack Lungmen.

Crownslayer:
If we can take control of Lungmen, Reunion will have a huge advantage.

Crownslayer:
Of course, this comes with a high risk.

Crownslayer:
...Why are you preoccupied with this idea?

Talulah:
...

Talulah:
Do you see that structure over there?

Crownslayer:
I see it.

Talulah:
That's the symbol of Lungmen... It's also...

Talulah:
...

Talulah:
I didn't come back here just to return everything that has been taken from the Infected.

Talulah:
I will also... make him pay.

Talulah:
Above all... Don't you think that... things are getting very interesting?

Talulah:
Don't you agree... Talulah?
