Hoshiguma:
All the Reunion members have been captured. None of them knew anything about the specific instructions...

Hoshiguma:
...

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en? What are you looking at that has you so absorbed?

Ch'en:
Didn't this used to be University Road?

Hoshiguma:
Hmm? Seems so. Its name was changed later.

Ch'en:
I think this is where my home used to be...

Hoshiguma:
Wasn't your apartment in Tai Bo?

Ch'en:
This was the estate that belonged to my biological father's clan. Looks like it's been renovated. So much time has passed that I barely recognize it anymore.

Hoshiguma:
Did you live here before studying abroad in Victoria?

Hoshiguma:
Even though I've heard that both you and Mister Wei were born to Yan aristocrats, it's really quite astonishing to see a mansion this big.

Ch'en:
Aristocrats? They were, but I'm not.

Hoshiguma:
But, your mansion here... How should I call it?

Ch'en:
Hmm, the Ch'en Estate will do...

Ch'en:
Come in.

Hoshiguma:
Huh?

Hoshiguma:
Woah woah, isn't this your own house? Why'd you slice the door open?

Ch'en:
I forgot to bring the key. Besides, Reunion also just opened a hole along the side wall. They might have caused some unexpected damage.

Hoshiguma:
That doesn't mean you shouldâ€” Ah, forget it. If you say so.

Ch'en:
No need to take off your shoes.

Hoshiguma:
Are you serious? Ch'en, answer me honestly, do you hate your old man?

Ch'en:
He doesn't deserve to be my father.

Hoshiguma:
Okay.

Hoshiguma:
If I remember correctly, you joined the L.G.D. right after you graduated from Victoria and returned to Lungmen.

Ch'en:
I was living in the dorms at the time.

Hoshiguma:
So, you never returned here after that.

Ch'en:
I have no lingering attachments to this place.

Hoshiguma:
People who say stuff like that usually have a lot more going on in their mind.

Hoshiguma:
Anyways, do you have any ideas about what this high-value target might be?

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en?

Hoshiguma:
...

Hoshiguma:
She's deep in her own little world again, huh.

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, I'll be waiting by the door. Call me when you're ready to go.

Keep all the toys orderly.

Do not go outside.

Do not talk to anyone without permission.

Do not make eye contact with adults without permission.

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
You really kept this room clean all this time.

Ch'en:
Hmph. How generous of you to keep a tidy bed for me. Or is this some kind of malediction because you think I'm bad luck?

Ch'en:
Wait, the photo... Right, the photo...

You shall receive no love from me, not in the slightest.

Sorry. I'm sorry, but I can't stand you. Just seeing you makes me want to peel my skin off my arms.

I cannot tolerate any of you. I am too selfish, but I can't live like this anymore.

One day, all of you will understand. If you hate me, so be it. Because I hate you too. And that's how it should be.

Ch'en:
Here it is.

Ch'en:
A photo from such a long time ago... I thought it had been lost.

Ch'en:
Wait, no... could this be what they're searching for?

Ch'en:
What's going on? Why would they be after this? Have you lost your marbles as well?

Ch'en:
I'll certainly help you, but what are you thinking? Why here, why now?

Ch'en:
Ah... What'd I expect. Of course you won't answer me.

Hoshiguma:
Ah, are you finally ready to go?

Ch'en:
We're going.

Hoshiguma:
Did you get any leads? Or did you want to play with the balls of yarn a bit longer?

Ch'en:
Hard to believe you're still in the mood to crack jokes.

Hoshiguma:
I think your mood is just a tiny bit better than it was before though.

Ch'en:
It's as you said. Maybe I did have a bit too much on my mind.

Hoshiguma:
That's right, according to the reports, Reunion is scattered throughout this entire area, and the forces we deployed earlier are driving them out.

Ch'en:
That's good. That makes our job easier, and we're getting closer to our goal.

Ch'en:
L.G.D., get into formation and move out! We're going to take back Lungmen!
