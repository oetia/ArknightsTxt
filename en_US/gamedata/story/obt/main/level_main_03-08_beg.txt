Reunion Member:
Ugh! They're still fighting back!

Reunion Member:
Skullshatterer!

Reunion Member:
As long as we can push them back, victory will be ours!

Skullshatterer:
Yes...

Skullshatterer:
Right now... we have no choice but to fight.

Hoshiguma:
These guys... are pretty tough!

Reunion Member:
Gaah-! Damn, that shield of yours...

Reunion Member:
Sh-she's the one from the L.G.D...!

Hoshiguma:
It's not too late to put down your weapons and surrender...

Hoshiguma:
Unless you want to die in vain right here.

Reunion Member:
You'd expect us to believe you?

Reunion Member:
Liar! Ursus... they've said the same thing before. But they executed those Infected, one by one...

Reunion Member:
I hid beneath the bodies of the slain, holding my breath, in order to survive.

Hoshiguma:
...

Reunion Member:
There are no depths to which your kind won't stoop... in order to exterminate us.

Reunion Member:
Aren't you just trying to round us up so you can kill us faster?

Reunion Member:
Very well. You've made your choice then.

Hoshiguma:
...

Franka:
You're not getting through to them, big fella. They won't listen to reason.

Franka:
They can't even distinguish between good and even, Lungmen and Ursus.

Franka:
In that place... No, in many places...

Franka:
Only hatred exists between those who are infected and those who are not.

Hoshiguma:
It seems that because of that... all communication has broken down. Even though there's another path in front of our eyes.

Skullshatterer:
Another path?

Skullshatterer:
What... could we possibly do?

Skullshatterer:
And what could you accomplish?

Reunion Member:
Don't waste any more time listening to their lies! Skullshatterer, let's get rid of them together!

Hoshiguma:
Explosions?

L.G.D. Agent:
He's planning to surround us from multiple directions!

Ch'en:
Our flank will collapse if we can't seize the initiative... Prepare to counterattack!

Reunion Member:
Skullshatterer! I'll cover you! Just kill them, and the battle will be over!

Reunion Member:
Skullshatterer...!

Skullshatterer:
I have to go back... with all of you...

Skullshatterer:
I have to...!!

Skullshatterer:
----------

Ch'en:
We don't have much time left!

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma.

Hoshiguma:
I'm ready.

Ch'en:
Act carefully. Don't show the enemy any signs of weakness.

Hoshiguma:
I won't give them an opening!

L.G.D. Agent:
Watch out, the enemy is charging forward!

Franka:
Amiya! Stay away from the enemy...!

Amiya:
Th-that's...

Amiya:
I...

Amiya:
Doctor... Doctor, what should I do...

Amiya:
But I don't want to...

Amiya:
I'm sorry, Doctor... I...

Skullshatterer:
...

Skullshatterer:
A-...

Skullshatterer:
Amiya...?

Amiya:
Why...

Amiya:
You...

Amiya:
Why did you become like this...

Skullshatterer:
Amiya... I guess this was our fate all along.

Ch'en:
Amiya! What are you doing? Hurry...

Amiya:
I...

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
Tsk...

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en? I...

Ch'en:
That's enough.

Ch'en:
It's time...

Ch'en:
...to put an end to this.

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en...

Ch'en:
There is one thing I must tell you.

Ch'en:
From now on, you'd better treat all Infected the same way... ...as your enemies.

Amiya:
...

Ch'en:
Life is unfair.

Ch'en:
If you want to hate someone, then hate me.

Ch'en:
L.G.D.! Attack!
