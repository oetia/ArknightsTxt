Reunion Member:
Curses...!

Reunion Member:
There are only two enemies! Get in there already!

Reunion Member:
What are you so scared of?!

Reunion Member:
We've already lost over twenty soldiers!

Reunion Member:
Those two devils are no ordinary people...!

Exusiai:
Watch your right!

Texas:
Give me a hand.

Reunion Member:
Keep pressuring her! I'll finish her off!

Texas:
I don't have time to deal with that guy rushing at me.

Exusiai:
You owe me a drink next time, all right?

Texas:
Sure, now hurry it up.

Exusiai:
All right!

Exusiai:
Hey, Mister Reunion guy?

Reunion Member:
Huh?

Exusiai:
This bullet is my gift to you. Make sure to accept it with gratitude~

Reunion Member:
Bullet? What the...

Reunion Member:
Guh... Ughh...

Heh, took care of him for you~

Texas:
Thank you very much.

Reunion Member:
Y-you monster!

Reunion Member:
Her... her sword...

Texas:
Aaaaahh! I'm sorry!!

Texas:
--Usually, I prefer to use two.

Reunion Member:
Gaah! Aaagh! !

Exusiai:
That's the rest of them.

Exusiai:
We were totally in sync back there!

Texas:
...Guess so.

Reunion Member:
Get back here!

Texas:
Here comes their main force.

Texas:
Looks like we made a bit too much noise and drew their attention.

Reunion Member:
Aaaaaah!!! You...!!

Reunion Member:
How can this be... What have you done?!

Exusiai:
Ah, don't take this personally.

Exusiai:
But, we're on a contract, you know?

Exusiai:
When you're in a logistics business, there's nothing more important than fulfilling your contracts!

Texas:
On your left.

Exusiai:
Huh?

Exusiai:
Wha- huh?

Exusiai:
Th-thanks.

Texas:
Please cover my right then.

Texas:
Start running. We need to move.

Amiya:
Exusiai, we're currently approaching your position!

Exusiai:
We've drawn the full attention of the enemy. The rest is up to you!

Amiya:
Stay safe, you two!

Amiya:
Franka, have you arrived at the destination yet?

Franka:
All good here.

Liskarm:
Liskarm and the other defenders are already in position.

Amiya:
Everyone, please be on your guard. The enemy snipers may be using the landscape to conceal themselves.

Amiya:
Make sure to mind your own positioning, and prioritize targeting the enemy snipers.

Amiya:
Next... we'll prepare our assault.

Amiya:
...But don't overdo it, we can't put our target in danger.
