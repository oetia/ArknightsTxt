Kal'tsit:
I understand.

Kal'tsit:
All right, keep in touch. Let me know if catch wind of anything.

Kal'tsit:
Just press the third button. Mhm.

Kal'tsit:
...Hmm? Dr. {@nickname}?

Kal'tsit:
Where's Amiya?

Kal'tsit:
...You actually let her go alone.

Kal'tsit:
...Whatever, at least someone is protecting her.

Kal'tsit:
I suppose you wouldn't be able to do anything even if you went with her. I'll let you off the hook this time.

Kal'tsit:
Did you also come back by yourself?

Kal'tsit:
Oh, Penguin Logistics.

Kal'tsit:
You also need to take better precautions to stay safe. We won't always have the luxury of reliable local guides.

Kal'tsit:
Dr. {@nickname}...

Kal'tsit:
Amiya will not be in Lungmen for a long time, since she has other missions to do.

Kal'tsit:
You'll have to face her again.

Kal'tsit:
...If I were you, I'd make sure to tell her the things that I couldn't say before.

Amiya:
Ah, Doctor?

Amiya:
Were you waiting for me this whole time...

Amiya:
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

Amiya:
Hmm? My complexion looks different from when I left?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Some things happened.

Amiya:
I feel like...

Amiya:
Perhaps Madam Ch'en has her own way of looking at things.

Amiya:
Even though her words are harsh, and she has done things that I can't accept...

Amiya:
Maybe... the difference between us isn't that big.

Amiya:
She has her responsibilities.

Amiya:
Oh... I understand now...

Amiya:
She also has her share of burdens to bear.

Amiya:
Perhaps I also...

Amiya:
Is that so...

Amiya:
I... just didn't have other choices.

Amiya:
...I suppose all these consequences were the results of my persistence.

Amiya:
Doctor, there's no need... to try to comfort me.

Amiya:
Actually, I'm well aware of this.

Amiya:
But what I don't know...

Amiya:
What I don't know, is how long we have to keep going before this world begins to change.

Amiya:
But, what I do know for sure...

Amiya:
Is that I won't give up.

Amiya:
I'll always bear the consequences of my actions, because... I chose this path.

Amiya:
Doctor...

Amiya:
Will you... stay by my side?

Amiya:
Even though... this guilt will always stay with me...

Amiya:
The regret of not being able to bring everyone with me. The regret of not being able to save my friends...

Amiya:
But I must face reality.

Amiya:
With everyone in Rhodes Island...

Amiya:
Hmm? A message from Dr. Kal'tsit...

Amiya:
Dr. Kal'tsit? Did you need something?

Kal'tsit:
Amiya, I've received communications from a few recon teams.

Kal'tsit:
The situation has changed for the worse.

Amiya:
Okay, I'll be right there.
