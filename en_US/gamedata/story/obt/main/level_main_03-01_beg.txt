Ch'en:
Looks like you had a rough time as well.

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en, what happened here?

Ch'en:
We were ambushed by Reunion.

Ch'en:
We were caught in a withering assault with no reinforcements. They easily routed our forces.

Amiya:
And Misha...?

Ch'en:
She was taken away by a woman dressed in red.

Ch'en:
I really should have...

Amiya:
...?

Ch'en:
Nevermind.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en, why is Misha so special?

Amiya:
If you keep hiding things from us, it's only going to be harder and harder for us to continue working together.

Ch'en:
I have no obligation to tell you.

Amiya:
But Rhodes Island has an obligation to understand the objectives and prepare our strategies accordingly.

Amiya:
Naturally, we'll continue to follow the L.G.D.'s instructions during our operations...

Amiya:
However, when it comes to using the Infected to fight other Infected, we need all the information we can get.

Amiya:
While you may have that information, you don't have the means of using it effectively to reduce your losses.

Amiya:
On the other hand, we have the ability to stop Reunion, but we don't know what they're after.

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
You sounded a bit like that doctor just now.

Amiya:
Is, is that so...

Amiya:
I think...

Amiya:
This is something that is equally important to both of us.

Ch'en:
I see.

Amiya:
If it's because you need to ask for permission from Chief Wei...

Ch'en:
When we investigated Misha, the most prominent bit of information was that her father was one of Chernobog's most influential people.

Amiya:
Misha's father?

Ch'en:
Naturally, we don't know how much Misha knows about Chernobog.

Ch'en:
She could know nothing, or she could know everything.

Ch'en:
Nobody knows...

Ch'en:
...except her.

Ch'en:
We also have no idea what kind of information she might have.

Ch'en:
Since you predicted that Lungmen would be Reunion's next target...

Ch'en:
It's obvious that we have to prevent Reunion from using Chernobog.

Ch'en:
That's why we can't allow them to have Misha.

Ch'en:
We were aware of the fact that someone who fit her descriptions had taken refuge in Lungmen...

Ch'en:
But until you actually found her, we weren't able to verify if that intel was accurate.

Amiya:
If that's the case, we can't waste any more time.

Amiya:
We have to stop Reunion and rescue Misha before they're able to take her back to Chernobog!

Amiya:
Rhodes Island, prepare to move out!

Ch'en:
It was the L.G.D.'s responsibility to track her down.

Ch'en:
...and letting Reunion capture her was a dereliction of our duties.

Ch'en:
Rather than lauching a joint operation, we'll need Rhodes Island to eliminate other threats from Reunion.

Ch'en:
This is an order.

Amiya:
...Understood.

Ch'en:
Don't let me down.

Reunion Member:
N-no! D-don't beat me...

Ch'en:
You should've thought twice before entering Lungmen!

Reunion Member:
Aaaagh!

Ch'en:
Lock them all up!

Ch'en:
They're not with this group of Infected. Curses...

Ch'en:
Not with this group either... Damn it all...

L.G.D. Agent:
They... retreated way too quickly...

Ch'en:
It seems that Reunion also has its own hierarchy.

Ch'en:
They just left the riffraff behind to buy them more time.

Ch'en:
To think that a single person could delay our reinforcements...

Ch'en:
Just who are they...

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam! We found some Reunion stragglers over there!

Ch'en:
Follow me!

L.G.D. Agent:
...!

L.G.D. Agent:
Be careful, Madam Ch'en!

L.G.D. Agent:
It's an ambush!

Reunion Member:
G-go to hell!

Ch'en:
Don't get in my way--!

L.G.D. Agent:
Madam Ch'en, we're still on Lungmen soil!

L.G.D. Agent:
The nearby facilities can still be used, so please try not to cause too much damage!

Ch'en:
Shut up already!

L.G.D. Agent:
At least, don't cut these buildings to pieces!

Reunion Member:
Th-this woman...

Reunion Member:
She's so hard to deal with!

Ch'en:
...Hard to deal with?

Ch'en:
Foolish Infected...

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
Did you think we'd allow you filth to treat Lungmen like your personal latrine?!

Ch'en:
L.G.D., attack!
