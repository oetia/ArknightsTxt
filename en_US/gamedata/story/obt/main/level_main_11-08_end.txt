Londinium Worker:
George, everyone willing to go is here.

Londinium Worker:
What about Tommy?

Londinium Worker:
No sign of him.

Londinium Worker:
That's fine. Volunteers only.

Feist:
George.

Londinium Worker:
You found what Catherine left for you, Feist? Was it what you were looking for?

Feist:
Yes.

Londinium Worker:
I'm glad.

Londinium Worker:
Now get going, before you can't.

Feist:
Wait, what's going on?

Londinium Worker:
Do you know why the Sarkaz took Catherine?

Londinium Worker:
She knew too much. They're executing workers like her.

Londinium Worker:
Something didn't feel right, so I had Day climb to the top of the factory to check.

Feist:
What...?

Londinium Worker:
Catherine kept it from us. She thought we didn't know anything.

Londinium Worker:
But we aren't stupid. We guessed what's going on.

Feist:
What are you gonna do?

Londinium Worker:
Nothing in particular.

Londinium Worker:
We've put up with the Sarkaz for a long time.

Londinium Worker:
More or less gotten used to it.

Londinium Worker:
Some folk think the Sarkaz will let us go, so long as we put up with them a little longer.

Londinium Worker:
Now they want to do away with Catherine.

Feist:
You'll die.

Londinium Worker:
Better than standing around and watching them kill Catherine.

Londinium Worker:
No one standing here has anything left to lose.

Feist:
I...

Londinium Worker:
Stop.

Londinium Worker:
You're with the Self-Salvation Corps.

Londinium Worker:
We've heard about you. Lots of us are happy for you.

Londinium Worker:
You've got more important things to do.

Londinium Worker:
Don't let Catherine's sacrifice be in vain.

Feist:
...No.

Feist:
Doctor, I may have gotten some information from Granny...

Feist:
But as the leader of this factory, Granny knows more about the Sarkaz production lines than anyone else.

Feist:
She has significant strategic value, doesn't she?

Feist:
...I request help from Rhodes Island.

Ascalon:
Here.

Ascalon:
They've tightened defenses, leaving gaps on the outside.

Ascalon:
It's mostly loosely-organized mercenary bands guarding the outer area.

Ascalon:
......

Ascalon:
On it.

Feist:
Thank you, Doctor, Ascalon.

Feist takes a deep breath.

He sticks his badge to his chest and goes in amongst the workers.

Londinium Worker:
Don't make any rash decisions, Feist.

Feist:
I'm not here as a member of the Self-Salvation Corps.

Feist:
I'm here as the grandson of Catherine, as someone who grew up in this factory.

Feist:
I belong here.

Feist:
Just like you, I don't want Catherine to die.

Feist:
I'm not gonna let her die, and I won't let you die either.

Feist:
The Doctor's people will cut off Sarkaz communications.

Feist:
Once we rescue Granny and the other factory bosses, we'll have plenty of time to get out of Highbury.

Feist:
I'll lead you to the Corps.

Feist:
Everyone will be safe.

Feist:
...Everyone should be safe.

The workers exchange stunned looks.

But they see the fire of hope beginning to burn in each others' eyes.

One by one, they get behind Feist.

They have decided to trust Feist.

Londinium Worker:
Feist! I-I'm going too!

Feist:
Tommy... thanks.

Feist:
But don't.

Londinium Worker:
Why?

Feist:
You hesitated because your dad's not well, right?

Londinium Worker:
But—

Feist:
And there's something I need you to do.

Feist:
No matter the outcome, you will report to the Sarkaz that we staged a riot.

Londinium Worker:
But...

Feist:
It's important. I have to keep the ones who stay behind safe.

Londinium Worker:
...Alright.

Feist:
Let's go, then.

Feist:
We'll get the old hands back.

Londinium Workers:
Right!

Catherine smokes her cigarette quietly.

She watches as the Sarkaz drag one familiar face after another to the makeshift firing range.

She sees on those familiar faces anger, disgust, resignation.

Then, in the end, peace.

She knows her turn will come soon.

She feels a sense of calm that she has never felt before.

Feist was right.

Compromise and subservience will solve no problems.

She must pay for her choices.

But she got to see her grandson one last time, and left him a little gift, before she had to pay.

That's enough.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
You're up, grandma.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Take her.

Catherine:
I can walk on my own.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Oh. Paprika.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Grimm never had you kill anybody, did he?

Paprika:
...Never.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Here's your chance.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Learn to kill.

Paprika:
......

Catherine:
This is how the Sarkaz treat a kid?

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
I heard what you said to her. You're right. She doesn't know what war is.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
I didn't want to know what war was, if I could help it. No Sarkaz does.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
But you left us no choice. None of you did. That's why it's time for her to learn.

Catherine:
......

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
I like that look in your eyes, grandma.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
It's the same look I've seen on buddies who died with their eyes wide open.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I've killed a lot.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
But it doesn't sit right with me, killing someone who can't fight back.

Sarkaz Warrior:
You can go back where you came from, if you don't have the stomach for it.

Sarkaz Warrior:
How do you know these workers didn't build the weapons that were used to kill your own people?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Morals are for peacetime. This is war. It's an argument we never got to have on fair, equal ground.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I don't need you to tell me that. I just...

Sarkaz Warrior:
Huh? A drone?

Feist:
Now!

Feist:
This is the place! I've scanned the area with the drone!

Feist:
Move!

Paprika:
C-Can't I let someone else do it?

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
No.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
I'm sure Grimm taught you not to question your captain's orders.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Either you kill her, or drop your weapon and I kill you.

Paprika:
I...

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Do it.

Catherine:
......

Paprika:
But...

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Do it!

Paprika:
I... I can't!

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
...I always said Grimm was too soft on you.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
We're not here to convince the Victorians to give our homeland back. If you can't do it, you're going to get it—

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Huh—a drone?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Captain! The workers are revolting!

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
What?

Londinium Worker:
Feist, we've got the Doctor giving orders here. We'll keep the mercenaries pinned down. Go and get Catherine!

Feist:
Alright!

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Are you out of your minds?

Feist:
No, we're not.

Feist:
Do you know how valuable an experienced worker is?

Feist:
They're in high demand, you know.

Catherine:
Feist! You—

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Hmph...

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
You could have lived longer if you pretended not to know anything.

Feist:
Too bad Granny always says I never know when to shut up.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
You think you can beat me?

Feist:
No, but maybe she can.

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Wha—

Sarkaz Mercenary Captain:
Umph...!

Catherine:
Bollocks, that thing was heavy...

Catherine:
Thanks, George. That felt good.

Londinium Worker:
Thank Feist.

Londinium Worker:
What about you, Sarkaz? Not gonna fight?

Paprika:
......

Catherine:
...Girl.

Catherine:
Your captain was right. This isn't the time to talk about right or wrong. We can't.

Catherine:
But if you don't know what you're fighting for...

Paprika:
...No.

Paprika:
Y-You can't go...

Sarkaz Mercenary:
......

Feist:
Guess I've got no choice then.

Feist:
Charge!

Sarkaz Warrior:
What's going on? Where is everybody?

Sarkaz Warrior:
I'm gonna have to report this, if I don't get a response—

Sarkaz Warrior:
Argh...

The Sarkaz warrior feels weightless.

In his blurring vision, he sees a black figure just before he collapses.

It was another Sarkaz.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Why... Sarkaz...

Ascalon:
Last one.

Ascalon is talking to herself, but she puts away the weapon with complete confidence that she is right.

She can clearly see the angry workers routing the Sarkaz mercenaries from her position.

Violence without strength of numbers was easily broken before years of pent-up anger.

The balance of power is reversed. Memories float to the surface.

She casts her gaze in another direction.

The center of Londinium.

Feist:
We've tied up all the mercs.

Feist:
How many injuries?

Catherine:
Not many. The mercenaries with this kid were in a panic and slow to react.

Catherine:
They didn't even make up their mind to fight.

Paprika:
W-We—!

Paprika:
We... we just...

Catherine:
You tried to resist, but you were ambushed by cunning Londiniers.

Catherine:
Their way, only a few old timers had to die.

Catherine:
Now the Sarkaz will have all your heads.

Catherine:
Is this your clever idea, Feist? Put all these years of patience to waste?

Feist:
No.

Feist:
If we watched you sacrifice yourselves to save our skins today, there'd be another group of victims tomorrow.

Feist:
Until everyone only cares about themselves.

Catherine:
......

Feist:
And... that's not your choice to make for all of us.

Catherine:
You're right. But it's not yours either.

Feist:
This time, though, everyone came to rescue you of their own accord.

Feist:
The Sarkaz have occupied the city for years... life is hard, but there are some red lines we can't let them cross. If we didn't come here today, we—

Londinium Worker:
The Sarkaz will eventually boil us all.

Catherine:
George... you too.

Catherine:
It's not all of you here. That means there are some who don't want to see me come back alive.

Feist:
......

Catherine:
Reality is crueler than you think, Feist. Right and wrong isn't so simple.

Catherine:
But what's done is done...

Catherine looks at Feist. It seems like she wants to say something.

She does not, however.

Catherine:
Let's go.
