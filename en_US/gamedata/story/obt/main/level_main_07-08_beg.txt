Kal'tsit:
Guard, explain yourself.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
I must look exactly like a Reunion member... huh?

Ursus Infected:
So you know each other.

Ursus Infected:
Right, so everything this Cautus said was a lie.

Ursus Infected:
You and Reunion have always been on the same side! Isn't that right?!

Amiya:
......

Rhodes Island Guard?:
...Tati... Did you find any food? The people in the shelter don't have long.

Ursus Infected:
What more do you want from me?!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Let's get you to someplace safe first.

Amiya:
Stay away from her, Guard!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
I'm staying back.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
...I know things might be hard to explain.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
But we have to be careful. All the Ursus here became Infected of no fault of their own... and they've had a tough time.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Most of them are already on the verge of mental breakdown... All it takes is someone to push them over the edge.

Ursus Infected:
We've had it 'tough?' You're psycho murderers! Sadistic freaks!

Ursus Infected:
Because of you... look what happened to me! Look what I've become!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
But if you don't leave right now, the devils will find you. You'll be handed over to Reunion.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Patriot's troops have completely pulled out of this area. If you're caught, I can't save you at that point.

Ursus Infected:
Then just let me die! I'd rather die than watch you monsters run rampant!

Ursus Infected:
What about guerrillas or this so called 'Aegis of the Infected?' ...Are they any different from the rest of Reunion?!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
They are. Without them, we'd be dead already.

Ursus Infected:
Tell me then! Right now!

Ursus Infected:
If they're just trying to do the right thing, why are they still with Reunion? Why'd they do this to our homes?!

Ursus Infected:
Why aren't they rebelling? Why aren't they walking out?! Why did they do all this even knowing we've been spat on, persecuted, and killed?

Ursus Infected:
Why didn't your great guerrillas fight back against the patrolling devils? Why?!

Ursus Infected:
I watched them... they used their own hands... to rip... tear...

Rhodes Island Guard?:
......

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Patriot can't be everywhere at once.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
When Patriot has to command his forces to defend the sanctity of life, something has gone horribly wrong.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
But... as long as the guerrillas still continue to pass through this area, I can assure you that the truly wicked in Reunion will not set foot here.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
That is the difference between Reunion's thugs and Patriot's guerrilla warriors. Patriot, and the Sarkaz as a whole, are much more disciplined than Reunion's ranks.

Ursus Infected:
Where are they then?! Why aren't they here?

Ursus Infected:
When they left, the other Infected were so much worse, so cruel!

Ursus Infected:
How is that not their fault? If not for the guerrillas, they never would've turned against us like this, right?! They're just out for revenge on the guerrillas!!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
...You're wrong.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
The guerrillas did the right thing. And while as you said, some may be trying to take revenge on the guerrillas...

Rhodes Island Guard?:
They gave you a chance to survive, so Reunion is retaliating against them. That is all.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
No, they did more than that... One might even say they're defending your dignity. I saw it with my own eyes.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
I saw the soldier telling the others to call you by your names, rather than your numbers.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Isn't that right?

Ursus Infected:
......

Rhodes Island Guard?:
And, the reason they left us alone was so that we could help you when they are away.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
...Chernobog has already been cut up into many pieces.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
There are some places that the guerrillas are stationed, but also many where they are not... If no one can maintain discipline, then if you want to survive... you can only depend on us.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
And that's even assuming we survive.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Amiya, do you believe what I said just now?

Amiya:
......

Ursus Infected:
No!

Ursus Infected:
Cautus girl, look... Look! He's Reunion!

Ursus Infected:
How can you believe anything coming from Reunion? And what about me? Am I supposed to buy into their bullshit now that I'm Infected?

Ursus Infected:
Look, the people you said wanted to murder us... aren't they Reunion?

Ursus Infected:
Now that I'm Infected, is Reunion suddenly going to take me in and treat me better? How the hell am I supposed to know who's who, and which one of you is going to kill me?

Ursus Infected:
You, Reunion, all of you should just... should just...!

Kal'tsit:
(Amiya.)

Amiya:
(Dr. Kal'tsit?)

Kal'tsit:
(Don't get worked up.)

Rosmontis:
Kal'tsit?

Rosmontis:
Kal'tsit, we should keep moving.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
...You...

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Why are you here...?! You, of all people!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Are you... trying to eradicate Reunion completely?! Rhodes Island, you're really no better...

Rosmontis:
Hm?

Rhodes Island Guard?:
...Forget that for now! The Sarkaz mercenary patrol is going to pass through this warehouse soon!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
If we don't deal with them, or at least hide, they're going to find us and take us away...

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Not to mention the regular Reunion patrols. We don't have much time to find supplies!

Rhodes Island Guard?:
That's why so many are starving, and short on medicine. There's a lot of death among the people of Chernobog.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Amiya, Dr. Kal'tsit! Also... Dr. {@nickname}, I really hope you can trust me. Or at least find somewhere to hide!

Amiya:
Guard...

Kal'tsit:
Infected Ursus woman.

Ursus Infected:
......

Ursus Infected:
Do you mean me?

Kal'tsit:
Infecterd Ursus woman, I have some honest questions for you.

Ursus Infected:
Y-your accent... you're from the capital of the Empire, aren't you?

Ursus Infected:
But the way you speak, it's so old-fashioned...

Kal'tsit:
You're educated.

Ursus Infected:
...I was a copyist at a university, before.

Ursus Infected:
It's all gone now, thanks to you Infected.

Kal'tsit:
All right, do you trust the man behind you? Our Infected former employee, now with Reunion?

Ursus Infected:
Huh?

Ursus Infected:
He's... your employee?

Kal'tsit:
One of Rhodes Island's functions is helping innocent Infected survive in a combat environment.

Kal'tsit:
Whether or not you are innocent remains to be seen...

Kal'tsit:
However.

Mon3tr:
————

Ursus Infected:
Aaaahh!

Amiya:
Dr. Kal'tsit!

Ursus Infected:
Y-you, your... what... is... mmng...

Rhodes Island Guard?:
...never thought I'd see a day when Mon3tr was after me.

Kal'tsit:
The blade pressed against your throat has an incision angle of only eight degrees. Another six millimeters deeper and it severs an artery.

Kal'tsit:
Miss.

Ursus Infected:
Um, err...?

Kal'tsit:
Did he truly work so hard to ensure your survival, as he claimed?

Ursus Infected:
What are you asking... What are you getting at?!

Kal'tsit:
Did he and his Reunion element, or any part thereof, threaten your life or take any action to harm you?

Kal'tsit:
I will deal with him in accordance with your response.

Ursus Infected:
Are you threatening me with his life?! I... we... we had nothing to do with each other!

Kal'tsit:
What about him, individually? Did he go along with Reunion and their crimes against humanity?

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Doctor... Kal'tsit... I'm insulted!

Kal'tsit:
I can only rely on the words of eyewitnesses and victims. Since you claim to have guaranteed her right to life, then I have only the young lady's testimony by which to adjudicate your claim.

Kal'tsit:
You gave only your side of the story.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
But what she says is also—

Kal'tsit:
She's in a different position.

Kal'tsit:
You have power. You can use violence. It doesn't matter what you did with that violence.

Rosmontis:
I felt it.

Rosmontis:
Amiya, it's the Sarkaz.

Rosmontis:
The targets are getting close.

Ursus Infected:
Couldn't... but he...

Kal'tsit:
Did he or did he not protect you from Reunion? Did he or did he not effectively keep you safe from their aggression?

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Dr. Kal'tsit...! The patrol is here! It's not... it's not the guerrillas! You can't... Don't let them...

Ursus Infected:
You're not making any sense!

Kal'tsit:
I am confident our actions are well within the ethical parameters of Ursus. It was you who made the accusation against him.

Ursus Infected:
He... he did go out regularly, about this time...

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Dr. Kal'tsit! Let me... stop the Sarkaz! Or at least... let me get them to go someplace else!

Kal'tsit:
I need an answer.

Kal'tsit:
Speak. Or we will never know the truth.

Rosmontis:
Twenty-four meters out, in a straight line. Very close.

Ursus Infected:
......

Rosmontis:
Twenty-two meters.

Kal'tsit:
Mon3tr.

Rhodes Island Guard?:
Dr. Kal'tsit!

Ursus Infected:
No! He didn't! He didn't do anything wrong!

Ursus Infected:
At least... at least nothing I saw!

Kal'tsit:
Amiya, Doctor.

Kal'tsit:
Thank you for your time.

Amiya:
Darn it... Dr. Kal'tsit! I knew it...!

Amiya:
Let's go, Doctor!

Amiya:
Our next target is Reunion's Sarkaz patrol team!

Rosmontis:
I'm coming too.

Rosmontis:
Guard, was it?

Rosmontis:
You're wrong about me. But I'll protect you. I'll get your revenge for you.

Rosmontis:
They'll pay for what they did to you, and my family, and the common people. They'll all pay, for all of it.
