Guard:
Is it just me, or is the sky getting darker?

Dobermann:
...If only it was just you.

Dobermann:
We never had much time anyway.

Dobermann:
The shape of the Catastrophe cloud is more clearly defined than the black haze it was before.

Dobermann:
Tsk. I don't like the feeling I get from watching it form over our heads. What a bad omen.

Dobermann:
To make things worse, Reunion goons might be lurking in every nook and cranny.

Dobermann:
Actually, that's probably too conservative.

Nearl:
What you should've said is that they're probably partying on the streets.

Medic:
Almost every street is filled with destruction, violence and looting. Vehicles and buildings are being set on fire...

Medic:
But these thugs decide that it's the perfect weather for a picnic!

Nearl:
If they're going out on a picnic now, it's the Catastrophe that will feast upon their bones.

Nearl:
This proves that most Reunion members are just fools who've been whipped into a frenzy.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...Pfft.

Medic:
Look, they're not really having a picnic...

Medic:
I, I just wanted something to moan about. You didn't have to take me so seriously...

Nearl:
...

Nearl:
Oh, you weren't being seriousï¼ŸWait, were you trying to crack a joke?

Nearl:
Hmm...

Nearl:
Sorry, I'm not good with this stuff...

Medic:
Umm... It's fine...

Medic:
It's just that... trying not to laugh is hard...

Medic:
Um, sorry... for trying to make a joke at such a serious time...

Amiya:
It's okay.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island wasn't founded for the sake of having everyone keep a serious face.

Amiya:
We've always wanted everyone to be able to smile.

Medic:
A-Amiya...

Amiya:
Don't worry about it!

Dobermann:
In any case, let's help out with the scouting.

Dobermann:
I'll quietly dispatch the enemy at our four o'clock.

Dobermann:
Hopefully their diseased organs won't explode or be rigged to serve as some kind of alarm.

Ace:
We'll wrap around and take care of the large group on the other side of the fortification.

Ace:
With this much chaos around us, nobody will notice a little more noise.

Dobermann:
All right, let's move out!
