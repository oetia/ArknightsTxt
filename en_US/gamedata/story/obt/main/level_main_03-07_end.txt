Reunion Member:
Don't let them get through!!

Reunion Member:
W should have escaped with Misha...!

Reunion Member:
We can't let!

Hoshiguma:
Out of my way! Do you have a death wish?!

Reunion Member:
Uaaagh!!

Franka:
O-ohhh... That savage fighting style reminds me of someone from Rhodes Island.

Franka:
They do have a lot in common, don't they?

Liskarm:
Franka, don't just stand there!

Liskarm:
Hurry up and do something!

Franka:
Sure, sure.

Exusiai:
Hah, looks like all those legends about Lungmen's Inspector are true...

Texas:
Stay focused.

Exusiai:
Hey, I'm not just...

Exusiai:
...Staring at other people! *Bang!*

Reunion Caster:
Argh!

Exusiai:
See those enemy squads on the second floor? I found 'em first!

Texas:
Good job.

Exusiai:
Hehe.

Texas:
...Let's go.

Texas:
We can't let our client handle this alone.

Amiya:
Franka, have you found Misha?

Franka:
I can't find her anywhere.

Franka:
W probably... already took her away...

Amiya:
...

Franka:
Tsk... Don't you think that was a bit too fast...

Amiya:
...?

Amiya:
What was that... an explosion?

Amiya:
Franka, gather your squad. We have to back up the L.G.D.!

L.G.D. Agent:
Rhodes Island, watch out!

L.G.D. Agent:
Th-this enemy...

L.G.D. Agent:
They...

Amiya:
What happened...? Talk to me!

Amiya:
The enemy...

Amiya:
...What? !

Amiya:
That's...?

Amiya:
H-how is that possible...?!

Ch'en:
...What?

Ch'en:
Tsk... Is this some kind of trick?

Reunion Member:
...

Reunion Member:
It's a miracle! It's a miracle!

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Why...?

Ch'en:
Don't just stand there! Take cover!

Amiya:
...

Reunion Member:
We've been sent a miracle!!

Reunion Member:
Is that you...? It's really you!!

Reunion Member:
...He's fine!!

Reunion Member:
H-he's fine again!

Reunion Member:
Skullshatterer is still alive!!

Reunion Member:
Skullshatterer! It's really you!!

Reunion Member:
Hooray! !

Amiya:
...Could it be...

Amiya:
...No...

Ch'en:
Reunion's morale has been boosted since the reappearance of their leader.

Ch'en:
It'll be more difficult to suppress them now.

Reunion Member:
...Skullshatterer, things are looking dire.

Reunion Member:
But at least... you've come back to us.

Reunion Member:
I'm so relieved... I'm so, so glad...

Reunion Member:
Misha should have made it out of here as well.

Skullshatterer:
...

Reunion Member:
Now, we can fight without any regrets!

Skullshatterer:
...I will stay here and hold them back.

Skullshatterer:
You should all go.

Skullshatterer:
I'll protect you all...

Reunion Member:
What are you talking about, Skullshatterer...

Reunion Member:
Didn't you promise that'd we go back to Ursus together? We still have to teach them a lesson!

Skullshatterer:
...

Skullshatterer:
Take care of yourselves. Don't die.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
No... Impossible...

Ch'en:
Hurry up and move it!

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, contact the L.G.D. forces stationed outside immediately!

Ch'en:
We've neutralized most of the traps and ambushes. The enemy leader, W, and the target are still missing.

Ch'en:
Right now, we're changing the mission objectives!

Ch'en:
All squads, move in and take out Reunion!

Amiya:
Why...

Amiya:
...Why is this happening...

Amiya:
No...
