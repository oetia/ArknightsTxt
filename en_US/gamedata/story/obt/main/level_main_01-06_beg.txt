Mephisto:
Indeed. They don't know that Faust is following them. I received some information from one of his scouts.

Mephisto:
Rhodes Island is trapped around the perimeter of the city center.

Mephisto:
Insects as they might be, they still might take advantage of the confusion caused by the Catastrophe to make their escape.

Mephisto:
Given their understanding of the situation in Chernobog, they could potentially interfere with our plans.

Mephisto:
... At least, getting rid of them won't do us any harm.

???:

Reunion Member:
Chernobog bastards! It's because of you, it's all your fault... that us Infected became like this!

Dobermann:
Get lost!

Reunion Member:
Ugh!

Dobermann:
These people, it's like they're just waiting to die! !

Nearl:
Why is Reunion going completely berserk?

Dobermann:
Why are they sending so many members out here now?!

Dobermann:
This makes no sense! There's no reason for them to be defending this place so staunchly!

Nearl:
Rhodes Island Operators, stand your ground! Push Reunion back and open up an escape route!

???:
————

???:
So that's the 'Rhodes Island' that I've been hearing so much about? Heh... How heroic.

Crownslayer:
...

Medic:
...Huh?

Guard:
... Falling rocks? At a time like this?

Dobermann:
Don't stop moving! Maintain our defensive line!

Guard:
Something's not right... These rocks are coming from the buildings...

Dobermann:
What are you talking about...

Reunion Member:
It's here! It's here!

Reunion Member:
Ahaha... salvation has come for us! Judgment day has come!

Reunion Member:
Ahhh, arghhhh--*CRASH!*

Reunion Member:
Ahhh, arghhhh--*CRASH!*

Dobermann:
...

Dobermann:
They were... crushed by something?

Dobermann:
Was it one of you... who attacked them?

Dobermann:
Or were they...

Amiya:
Dobermann! Look, the sky...!

Nearl:
...

Nearl:
The sky was dyed a bloody crimson...

Nearl:
'Boiling dark clouds, tumbling in flames...'

Ace:
Don't panic!

Nearl:
Keep your senses about you!

Dobermann:
... We still can make it out of this alive if we act decisively!

???:
'...As terror strips away their voices, the land falls into silence.'

???:
'The titanic Originium lowers its head...'

???:
'...and falls upon the scorched shadow of death.'

Crownslayer:
Talulah.

Talulah:
...

Crownslayer:
What do we do next?

Talulah:
... Perhaps they will be able to survive the Catastrophe.

Talulah:
Finish off the stragglers.

Crownslayer:
Very well.

Dobermann:
Even though I figured that Reunion would be using the Catastrophe to take their revenge...

Dobermann:
I didn't expect them to use it to completely destroy Chernobog...

Dobermann:
Rather than vengeance, this seems more like a manifesto...

Dobermann:
Something about the Era of the Infected... or something like that?

Medic:
Aaaahh...

Medic:
The entire sky... is crashing down...

Guard:
Watch out! !

Medic:
What's that...

Amiya:
Be more alert!

Medic:
-- Oh!

Amiya:
Protect the Medic - hurry and take her someplace safe!

Guard:
Roger!

Ace:
All operators, find cover!

Amiya:
All teams, prepare to... weather the Catastrophe!
