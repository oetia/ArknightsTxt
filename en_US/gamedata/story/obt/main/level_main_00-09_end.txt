Medic:
Aaaagh--!

Guard:
Watch out! !

Medic:
I'm fine... It's just a scratch, don't worry...

Amiya:
Not good enough... At this rate, they're going to close in on us.

Dobermann:
I've already found the weak point in their line, but without reinforcements, it's taking all we have just to hold them back!

Amiya:
...Please hold out a bit longer! Focus your fire on the ranged enemies!

Amiya:
Our Casters will take care of their vanguard!

Mephisto:
Good, good! This is how things should be! Next up, F3, E5!

Dobermann:
This bloody brat...!

Mephisto:
Excellent! Now, B4, B5!

Guard:
The enemy is now trying to flank us!

Amiya:
Take two Defenders and a Sniper! Just keep them busy!

Mephisto:
And next! H2, H6!

Medic:
They... they're rushing our defensive line!

Ace:
Vanguards, flush them out!

Mephisto:
That's right, let me see how you struggle!

Mephisto:
Now, Casters. move to C7. Capture their Rook!

Amiya:
Enemy Casters have appeared! So far, they're hiding behind their Defenders!

Dobermann:
It's too late! Take cover!

Medic:
Aaargghh!

Guard:
*cough* *cough*...

Mephisto:
Now be snuffed out, like flames before a storm!

Amiya:
Is he really commanding his troops like that? How can he give such precise orders just by barking out chess moves?

Amiya:
Those same disorderly thugs have been turned into an army under his command...!

Amiya:
At this rate, he's going to keep exploiting the advantage he gets through his leadership...

Dobermann:
On the other hand, if we manage to suppress him, they'll fall into disarray!

Dobermann:
Don't give them even the slightest opening!

Dobermann:
Damn it, we're running out of time!

Amiya:
We can't allow ourselves to be stalled any longer!

Amiya:
Is there some way to turn the tables... anything?!

Amiya:
We're going to be... Doctor's going to...

Reunion Member:
Gaaaaaaahh!!!

Mephisto:
What?!

Mephisto:
Huh... What's going on? Why are people getting knocked into the air?

Mephisto:
What...

Mephisto:
... the hell is that?

???:
You guys sure took your sweet time. I even had time to relocate the civilians.

Amiya:
--?!!

???:
Out of my way!

Reunion Member:
Woah!!

???:
Let's hit 'em even harder! Don't give the enemies a chance to regroup!

Amiya:
Miss Nearl!!

Nearl:
I'm here.

Nearl:
I'm glad you're still safe, Amiya. Let's move.

Dobermann:
Thank goodness you were deployed in this operation.

Nearl:
Using the signal flare was judicious. Seems like you've been having a rough time.

Nearl:
...

Nearl:
You must be Dr. {@nickname}, right?

Nearl:
Radiant Knight, Nearl, at your service. Your chariot has arrived.
