Hui-chieh:

I don't know how much further I have to go.

I can hear the winter feathers chirp every now and then. Is that supposed to mean something? Does it mean that spring will be here soon?

It's still very cold here, but it shouldn't be much longer until it starts to get warmer.

It's been three weeks. We've finally found two more villages willing to trade with the Infected.

We've set up camp at an abandoned settlement a few kilometers away from them. There's plenty of fuel here to last us a while.

You can't imagine how awful tree bark tastes. I don't ever want to listen to the old man tell me how nutritious they are anymore.

December 7th

I am very well aware where this road is taking us.

Nonetheless, we have to get to the end of the road. Even if I don't make it, Yelena, Alina, and Eno and Sasha as well... I am sure they will make it.

But the road beneath our feet is just way too murky and hard to see.

Will they reject us? We can't bring their hopes up too much.

It's a bad thing to make a promise you cannot fulfill. The Ursus Empire's promise about bread and bed was nothing more than a ruse to cover up their atrocities and lies. And lies are what lead to tyranny.

Will they come to loathe us? It's very likely. If it wasn't for how hard life is in the Northern Plains, people here would probably report the Infected to the Patrol Unit the moment they spotted them.

This kind of animosity probably came from how worried they are about their own situation.

I'm not like Buldrokkas'tee. We certainly need to be on the lookout and avoid that, but I don't believe that's in their nature.

We can't hold it against them just because they want to look out for themselves. Definitely not.

Will they try to hurt us? I have no idea. And it's probably not something I can worry about too much...

No matter the case... I think most people are only like that because of the circumstances they are in.

If they had a teacher like Alina, a team like ours, or the chance to live in harmony with Infected... I'm sure things would improve.

Most of them were simply brainwashed by Ursus's twisted ideology. We can help them. Knowledge can change the way people think.

It's just... it's a really difficult thing to do. That's even though I believe... if you always hold fast to your beliefs in your actions, getting everyone to accept the truth should be one of the simplest things to accomplish.

【The words above were crossed out. Naturally, the letter was never mailed out.】

Alina:
Oh, good morning.

Talulah:
Wouldn't it be dangerous for you to head outside right now?

Alina:
I talked to the soldiers, and they said the patrol unit all went to the village to the west. Did someone see you trading with them the other day?

Talulah:
It's not impossible. Anyway, you should stay away from the west.

Alina:
I know. I'll go to the village to the east instead. I should still be able to barter for some things there.

Alina:
Oh, you don't need to worry so much. Remember, we used to find ourselves in situations much more dangerous.

Talulah:
What are you trying to get this time?

Alina:
Some canned fruits and dried vegetables.

Talulah:
...Are those things really worth heading outside for?

Alina:
Our fighters will get sick if things don't improve soon. It's about time you pick up a few things about taking care of yourself...

Talulah:
We're having trouble just getting enough food to feed ourselves. I really don't think we should go out of our way for....

Alina:
Now, Talulah, that's not right.

Alina:
Uh huh, ahem—

Alina:
'It's precisely because there are times we don't get enough food on the table or even clothes to keep ourselves warm that things like songs, music, fruits, and flower, and our desire for all the things that delight our taste buds, our eyesight, and our sense of smell are so important.'

Alina:
'These are the things that remind us what we are fighting for: we're fighting so that everyone can lead a decent life.'

Alina:
Naturally, your health is part of all that. With just some vegetables and fruits, we can help a lot of people fight off their diseases.

Talulah:
...Rebutting me with my own words... That's cheating.

Alina:
Hey now... Cheating? That's quite a serious charge, isn't it? Here, say it after me: 'That's smart!'

Talulah:
Okay, okay.

Talulah:
Do you need someone to go with you? A bodyguard, that is.

Alina:
That probably isn't a good idea. I may be Infected, but I am not that special. I wouldn't want anyone to find out about us just because of me. Besides, it isn't too hard for me to hide my infection. Easier than for some of our soldiers.

Talulah:
Okay, but you should still be careful. I don't think we can completely trust the villagers there... There are a lot of things that don't add up there.

Alina:
Yep, okay. Oh, I'll try to get us some pears too. Or do you reckon the Yetis like apples more?

Talulah:
I think they are more of a fan of raspberries... but let's not worry about them. They know how to look for those themselves.

Talulah:
I've got a meeting now.

Alina:
Okay, I'm leaving.

Talulah:
—Alina!

Alina:
What's up?

Talulah:
I'm thinking about putting together an Infected education group. Would you like to run it?

Alina:
Huh? Am I really the right person for that?

Talulah:
You have a much better reputation than me among the noncombatant Infected.

Talulah:
It'll be easier for me to introduce you to everyone.

Alina:
That's not what I mean...

Talulah:
Knowledge is a means of fighting itself, Alina. I insist.

Alina:
Well...

Alina:
I'll leave the decision to you. I don't need to write up any speeches or anything, do I?

Talulah:
Oh, I can hear the applause already.

Alina:
...Stop teasing me. Okay, I'll get going now.

Talulah:
See you later. Don't stay out too late!

Shieldguard:
That won't work. We need to hang them.

Shieldguard:
The captain isn't around right now, but I know that's what he'd order us to do.

Talulah:
Remember, guerrilla fighters. We are not an army. At least not yet.

Talulah:
It gives a bad impression. When they first joined us, it was because they trusted us. They only started having doubts because of hunger. That's the only reason they made this mistake.

Talulah:
It only happened because we didn't keep our end of the bargain.

Shieldguard:
What bargain? Feeding them what little food we have left?

Talulah:
We promised the Infected a place to stay.

Talulah:
...Not everyone came here for a noble end. That's not realistic.

Talulah:
We could've earned even more of their trust if we had the machines exchanged for the provisions sooner.

Shieldguard:
In any case, I cannot accept keeping them on the team.

Talulah:
Then let them go.

Talulah:
I won't tolerate any excessive violence. Also, give them enough rations for a week before you exile them.

Shieldguard:
Absolutely not! Not even our warriors get that kind of treatment!

Talulah:
......

Shieldguard:
We're not going to give in on this one. It has nothing to do with achievements or whatever. We simply can't abide by their behavior.

Talulah:
Fine. At least don't go overboard with the language. Don't chew them out too much.

Shieldguard:
...We can accept that.

Talulah:
Good.

Shieldguard:
Now that the patrols are trying to smoke us out to the west... we can't let them find the group of Infected there.

Shieldguard:
That's all the more reason to put these bastards over...

Shieldguard:
Hm? Someone's knocking.

Talulah:
Come in.

Infected Fighter:
*Pant*...

Infected Fighter:
Talulah!

Infected Fighter:
It's the Patrol Unit! They're investigating the village that traded food with us!

Infected Fighter:
Should we get out of here? If we leave now, we'll be long gone by the time they found out about us!

Talulah:
—

Talulah:
Draw the patrol unit our way. I'll ambush them somewhere close by. We must let the patrol squad think we're behind it all, even if we have to leave our tracks behind for them to find.

Shieldguard:
Talulah! Think this through again! The Fourth Army's sentries are just ten kilometers away. Once they get word from the patrols about us, they will definitely come after us!

Talulah:
If the villages are pillaged because they gave us a helping hand... No, suppose they didn't. If they come in harm's way because of us, the Infected, we'll never find another village willing to trade with us.

Infected Fighter:
Then let's take it upon ourselves to keep the news from spreading.

Talulah:
That's exactly how word about this gets out!

Talulah:
Listen to me. If you try to put a lid on this by killing everyone there, the bodies will become evidence. If you then get rid of their bodies, then the deserted village will be evidence instead.

Talulah:
If you want to keep any bad news about us from spreading, then there's only one way to go about it: Don't let anything bad happen in the first place.

Talulah:
What we need to do now is to widen the path we have ahead of us, not just for ourselves, but also for the descendants of those who are following us down this path. Any questions?

Shieldguard:
No.

Infected Fighter:
You have a point. Let's do that.

Talulah:
Let's go.

Talulah:
Right, what you said just now makes sense. Protect all non-combatants, and help them evacuate first.

Talulah:
We have a tough battle ahead of us. I'll be fighting alongside you, but neither FrostNova and Patriot are here with us; remember, one day, you may not even have me fighting next to you.

Talulah:
But as long as what you are fighting for is just and feasible, then we don't need anyone else by our side. You don't need anyone by your side.

Infected Fighter:
Yeah!

Talulah:
Let's go.
