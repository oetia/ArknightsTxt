Chernobog Underground Base

10:30 a.m.

Kal'tsit:
Yes.

Kal'tsit:
We'll begin the operation after we finish collecting all the environmental information. Before that, it'll benefit you to hear exactly what's going on inside Chernobog's core city.

Kal'tsit:
Amiya's a bit tied up on the scene, so she won't be able to join this discussion.

Kal'tsit:
You've already read the information in the mission briefing, but that kind of information is not good enough for a mind like yours.

Kal'tsit:
If the worst comes to pass, I don't want you to sacrifice yourself while still not knowing a single thing.

Kal'tsit:
If you've taken interest in some part of me, you can just come out and say it. No need to stare so much.

Kal'tsit:
You might not remember, but I do. I remember you had quite a talent for heating up rations by pouring boiling water directly into your mouth at four in the morning.

Kal'tsit:
If you don't believe me, you can try for yourself.

Kal'tsit:
But skip the chatter. We don't have much time.

Kal'tsit:
Rhodes Island and the L.G.D. worked together to take down Reunion, and neutralized the forces controlled by Mephisto and Crownslayer.

Kal'tsit:
After that, Reunion's deployments in Lungmen fell apart completely.

Kal'tsit:
Amiya reported to me that you had a difficult fight with a 'FrostNova,' an Infected serving Reunion as leader of a special squad, at the bottom of Lungmen.

Kal'tsit:
The battle ended in your victory.

Kal'tsit:
I understand. According to the data from PRTS, you had the cooperation of our operators when you brought the enemy's body back to Rhodes Island for treatment.

Kal'tsit:
Dr. {@nickname}, 'distinguish your friends from your foes.'

Kal'tsit:
...No. You might get the wrong idea, but you must hear me out.

Kal'tsit:
I am not trying to blame you, Dr. {@nickname}.

Kal'tsit:
Amiya told me what happened between you and the enemy commander. Only those who were there at the time had the information to decide what to do.

Kal'tsit:
I don't have the right to overreach and criticize your judgment.

Kal'tsit:
You tried to understand the motives of that Infected. You were willing to bear the consequences for the things she, FrostNova, did.

Kal'tsit:
That is what you did.

Kal'tsit:
If you plan to use this method to make sense of the suffering in this world, I have no reason to blame you.

Kal'tsit:
I am even willing to vouch for you before the operators of Rhodes Island. Dr. {@nickname}, make your own decisions, and I will try not to interfere.

Kal'tsit:
After that, I will determine the part of the responsibility that belongs to Rhodes Island.

Kal'tsit:
Your powers and responsibilities compliment one another. 'Distinguish your enemies from your friends.' Those are your words, not mine.

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
(Whispers) If you really want to breathe as one...

Kal'tsit:
I never said that.

Kal'tsit:
More accurately, FrostNova and her Yeti Squad were a guerilla team of elite Infected.

Kal'tsit:
Right now, there are still two elite forces that Reunion is still able to mobilize. These guerilla warriors are the first.

Kal'tsit:
The second is the Sarkaz mercenary, W, and her team of sellswords.

Kal'tsit:
According to my intel, W used some underhanded tactics to seize leadership of the Sarkaz mercenaries working with Reunion.

Kal'tsit:
We don't have time to go over what should be common historical knowledge, but let me say this frankly — Sarkaz mercenaries are unreliable, a problem W faces just as much as Reunion.

Kal'tsit:
Sarkaz mercenaries are unlike normal agency mercenaries. They are the overflowing military might of Kazdel, spilling out across the land.

Kal'tsit:
Trying to control them is an act of folly. It will only anger the forces backing them.

Kal'tsit:
I haven't even gotten to the important part.

Kal'tsit:
The point is, the Infected guerrillas of Yeti Squad are completely different from the Sarkaz mercenaries.

Kal'tsit:
There are no similarities between them in terms of their form, organization, behavior, or creed.

Kal'tsit:
Before joining Reunion's ranks, they were an independent guerrilla force of Infected, and their prestige was even greater among certain groups of Infected than that of Reunion.

Kal'tsit:
...And before they formed this guerrilla force, they used to be a part of the mighty Ursus military.

Kal'tsit:
...

Kal'tsit:
I'm not sure where you learned that piece of information, Doctor, but I color me impressed.

Kal'tsit:
Though that piece of information itself is fairly basic, I am relieved that you're able to proactively gather intel on your own.

Kal'tsit:
I only give what you deserve.

Kal'tsit:
We've arrived at the foundations of the industrial sector at Chernobog's core city.

Kal'tsit:
Next, we'll lead three teams through the complex underground passages, take the sewer pipes into the industrial layer, and come up in the heart of the core city.

Kal'tsit:
Be aware that any enemies you see patrolling these areas are not the ordinary Reunion thugs you're used to fighting.

Kal'tsit:
We will meet rigorously trained... 'soldiers.' Reunion's 'soldiers,' trained in the tactics of Ursus's own army by the guerrillas.

Kal'tsit:
Our recon operators discovered that communication networks have been forcefully cut off within the core city. Rather, it seems that Reunion didn't even try to maintain these channels.

Kal'tsit:
This is a severe constraint upon modern-day squads who rely on the most common modes of communication.

Kal'tsit:
What this means is Reunion either already has some special way of communicating, or they simply aren't prepared to fight.

Kal'tsit:
Based on what we saw in Chernobog a month ago, don't expect that second scenario. However, if communication is cut off, the lower-ranking Reunion members won't receive direct commands.

Kal'tsit:
Most of the time, expect them to act independently.

Kal'tsit:
I fear they won't know signals they cannot receive— a signal that only countries and city-states can distinguish. One that marks the territory of Ursus.

Kal'tsit:
A terrible storm is brewing within this city. Chaos, whether caused accidentally or deliberately, will permeate everywhere like thick smoke.

Kal'tsit:
They're a step ahead of me, and the seeds of ruin have already been sown.

Kal'tsit:
Conflict is brewing within Reunion.

Kal'tsit:
I've seen the same thing unfold countless of times across this land.

Kal'tsit:
I've said pretty much everything I needed to say. As for the rest, we'll cross those bridges when we get to them.

Kal'tsit:
Even if we're still just preparing for war, efficiency still matters.

Kal'tsit:
Please help me notify the members of Team R-4, Doctor. Have them take these devices.

Kal'tsit:
Is there a problem?

Kal'tsit:
Yes.

Kal'tsit:
You seem to know more about Rosmontis than the conversation you had in the bioprocessing unit indicated.

Kal'tsit:
Every elite operator has a considerable amount of strength. We expect them to take charge.

Kal'tsit:
...So, you haven't had the time to understand how Rosmontis fights.

Kal'tsit:
But just to get this out of the way, there are some things they should not be shouldering alone. As a field commander, a necessary part of your job is to help relieve the pressure on these operators.

Kal'tsit:
In this upcoming battle, you may make some shocking discoveries.

Kal'tsit:
Very few people aren't shocked after watching Rosmontis fight.

Kal'tsit:
Make sure you're ready for it.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Dr. {@nickname}, you're here!

Rhodes Island Operator:
We intercepted an enemy patrol squad, steadily handling the situation.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Doctor, your position there is kinda risky...

Rhodes Island Operator:
I think you'll probably want to move.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Right there... Behind you...

Rhodes Island Operator:
Doctor, it's really dangerous to stand next to her!

???:
...Enemy.

Rosmontis:
Enemy.

Rosmontis:
Doctor, those are the ones who killed my family... Enemies!

Rosmontis:
......

Rosmontis:
Doctor, step aside. Get out of the way.

Rosmontis:
I'm not like Amiya. Amiya's Arts can go around her friends to strike her enemies...

Rosmontis:
But not me. I can't.

Rosmontis:
So don't stand between me and my fight.

Reunion Member:
Gyaaah!!

Reunion Member:
That girl, the one carrying that box... Wh-what's going on...

Reunion Member:
What's wrong with my eyes? I can't see anything! My eyes! My face!! It hurts! It hurts!!!

Reunion Member:
Something's crushing my head!

Rosmontis:
......

Rosmontis:
No.

Rosmontis:
It's been a long time since I've crushed anyone to death.

Reunion Member:
Those swords... Those swords!

Rosmontis:
...Reunion.

Rosmontis:
I don't want you in my memories.

Rosmontis:
Any of you.
