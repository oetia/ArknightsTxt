Amiya:
We've had to fight through so many Reunion just to reach this observation point...

Amiya:
Huh...?

Amiya:
Is that... Madam Ch'en?

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en!

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
(Why are there so many bodies...)

Amiya:
(So many fallen Reunion troops... did Madam Ch'en do all this by herself?!)

Ch'en:
...!

Ch'en:
It's you...

Ch'en:
I lost control of myself. Sorry...

Ch'en:
I might have fallen into the enemy's trap...

Amiya:
No... It's fine, we're still on track with the original plan. It's just that...

Amiya:
The one who appeared earlier... was that Talulah?

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
...No. It doesn't matter now. My gut feeling was wrong. This place doesn't look like some place that person would be anyway.

Ch'en:
Our mission still remains top priority.

Ch'en:
...Without me, the L.G.D. would struggle to carry out this search mission.

Ch'en:
Especially given this current situation...

Ch'en:
It's a lot more complicated than I expected.

Ch'en:
With things as they are, it's far too risky to push further alone.

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en, we also hope that you can return to the L.G.D. right away.

Amiya:
The large amounts of Originium residue left here by the Catastrophe is very harmful to the uninfected.

Amiya:
Even if you brought medication beforehand, it won't last long...

Ch'en:
What about you?

Amiya:
Our mission is to protect Lungmen and eliminate threats--

Amiya:
But the most important reason for us coming here is to rescue our operators.

Amiya:
Rhodes Island does not turn its back on anyone.

Amiya:
Therefore, we will continue to carry out our combat operations.

Ch'en:
...

Ch'en:
I'll bring my squad to merge with yours... if the situation allows for it.

Amiya:
That's great.

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en! Rhodes Island can dispatch a squad to escort you...

Ch'en:
No need.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...Madam Ch'en has a lot of pride, huh?

Amiya:
Hmm? Doctor?

Amiya:
Don't worry...

Amiya:
I know... Rhodes Island will be fighting alone again.

Amiya:
But, it's too early to be feeling down.

Amiya:
Come on, Jessica and the others are still waiting for us.
