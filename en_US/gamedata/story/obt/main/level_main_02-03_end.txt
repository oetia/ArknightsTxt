Misha:
Phew...

Misha:
I probably won't be found if I hide here...

Misha:
But, I won't be able to go back to those kids anymore.

Misha:
I hope nothing happens to them...

Misha:
*sigh*... Why...

Misha:
...!

Misha:
Who is it?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Are you Miss Misha?

Misha:
...What?

Misha:
...

Amiya:
I'm sorry, Miss Misha. I hope I didn't scare you...

Amiya:
These are my coleagues, Franka and Liskarm.

Franka:
Hey there.

Liskarm:
Good day.

Amiya:
We're from Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals. As an organization made to serve the Infected, at least...

Amiya:
We hope to be able to help you. That's why we'd like to talk for a bit.

Misha:
Talk?

Amiya:
Mhm.

Amiya:
This isn't the best place for that though...

Amiya:
As of right now, our top priority is keeping you safe.

Amiya:
For the time being, we'll protect you, so rest assured.

Misha:
What... are you talking about...

Misha:
...

Misha:
You're just going to capture me and lock me up, aren't you? !

Misha:
Get away from me! My claws are sharp...! If you don't want to get hurt...

Franka:
...Pfft.

Misha:
What are you laughing about...

Franka:
If we really were going to capture you, we wouldn't have given you a chance to resist.

Misha:
...

Amiya:
Miss Misha, we really do want to help you, so...

Misha:
I don't trust you...

Misha:
Lungmen treats the Infected worse than they treat criminals!

Misha:
Why would you... Why would you go out of your way to help the Infected?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
--Miss Misha, look...

Misha:
What... are you doing?

Misha:
...Your...

Misha:
Your hand...

Misha:
You're also... an Infected?

Amiya:
That's right, I'm just like you.

Amiya:
There are a lot of Infected in these slums. Those kids you left behind just now... they trusted you.

Amiya:
Misha, you've already put them in danger.

Misha:
...Are you going to use those kids to threaten me?

Amiya:
No, I wouldn't. But someone has already started doing exactly that...

Amiya:
We just chased off a group of thugs that was trying to threaten those kids.

Misha:
...!

Amiya:
Lungmen is also currently searching for the Infected. If Lungmen found you first, it might've already been too late.

Amiya:
We wanted to divert the rioters from those kids by drawing their attention to you...

Amiya:
Looking at it from another perspective, we'd also be able to keep you safe from harm.

Misha:
...Do you know why they're after me?

Misha:
What reason do you have... to do all this for me?

Amiya:
We actually don't know why there are Infected targeting you...

Amiya:
But we do care about the safety of innocents, including you. At least, this is the best course of action for the time being. I hope that you'll be able to trust us.

Amiya:
Would you allow us to take you from here first?

Misha:
...

Misha:
...Fine... Let's go.

Misha:
After all, I don't really have a choice, do I?

Amiya:
I wouldn't say that...

Amiya:
But at least, thank you... Miss Misha!
