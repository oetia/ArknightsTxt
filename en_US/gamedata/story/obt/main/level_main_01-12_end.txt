W:
Ahh... What a nostalgic feeling!

W:
Amiya, was it?

W:
——

W:
Ah, ahaha! I see... So that's what's going on.

W:
I remember now, Amiya.

Amiya:
...What?

W:
I've already gotten what I came for. You can all go now. Shoo.

Amiya:
You...!

Reunion Member:
W...?

W:
... What, do you lot want to stay here and die? That's perfectly fine by me. You're all free to do as you please.

Reunion Member:
...

Reunion Member:
We're falling back. Let them go. Talulah's orders.

Amiya:
...?

W:
Forget it. Things get boring when they get dragged out too long. I hate being bored, that's all there is to it.

W:
However, I do look forward to seeing you again, Amiya.

W:
As well as... that person.

Amiya:
What...? !

W:
Next time, I will hear the truth from you, {@Nickname}.

W:
Bye~

Amiya:
What... Why... is she doing this?

Dobermann:
Reunion... they've left.

Dobermann:
--We've long missed the rendezvous time.

Dobermann:
Retreat back to Rhodes Island... immediately.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
I'll escort... the Operators in the back.

Nearl:
Amiya...

Amiya:
I'm fine.

Nearl:
... All right..

Dobermann:
Go, Amiya.

Guard:
...

Guard:
... ...

Guard:
... Boss...?

Guard:
Where are the others...

Ace:
Nearl and the others have already broken out with Amiya and Dr. {@nickname}.

Ace:
Those who stayed behind...

Ace:
... They're all gone.

Guard:
... What...

Ace:
We're the only two left.

Guard:
I remember now... That, that freak... Talulah... single-handedly...

Guard:
She knocked away our Guards like they were toy bricks...

Guard:
That monster cut through our Defenders as if they were butter...

Ace:
Hush... Your wounds are deep.

Guard:
The Catastrophe...! She is Catastrophe incarnate... How, how else could she have reduced our squads to ashes in an instant...

Guard:
Even though I saw it with my own eyes, I can't... I can't believe it...

Guard:
The screams... Aagh... Gaaaah...

Ace:
Snap out of it!

Guard:
I'm so sorry... I, I don't know how...

Ace:
Calm down.

Ace:
I gave you some emergency treatment.

Guard:
... Boss... what happened to your arm...?

Ace:
At least I still have one I can use.

Guard:
Boss... You should go. I'm sure you'll be able to break your way out.

Ace:
We only managed to stall her for a few minutes.

Ace:
Until Dr. {@nickname} and Amiya are safe, I cannot go.

Ace:
I have to stop that monster first.

Guard:
Boss... I also...

Ace:
The price of your life... was paid with my arm.

Ace:
If you can live even a single minute longer, it will be worth it.

Guard:
...

Ace:
I'll be right back. Take care of yourself.

Guard:
Boss... I'm sorry... that I'm so unworthy.

Guard:
Amiya...

Guard:
I'm sure you'll be able to... make everyone's dreams...

Amiya:
...

???:
They're all... I...

Amiya:
... ...

???:
... Amiya?

???:
... ... Amiya?

Amiya:
Oh, huh?

Medic:
What's the matter?

Amiya:
N-nothing... I just suddenly felt...

Amiya:
Grief...

Medic:
*sniff*... Urk...

Medic:
Grief... huh...

Medic:
Aauugh...

Amiya:
... Don't cry...

Amiya:
At least... for now.

Amiya:
Someone once said to me...

Amiya:
Tears... should be saved for when the war is over.

Amiya:
Now... is not the time.

Medic:
Nnh... Ugh... Nn...

Amiya:
Let's go...

Amiya:
...We're going home.
