Reunion Member:
Ugh...

Reunion Member:
You bunch... aren't from Ursus...

Guard:
*gasp* *gasp*...

Dobermann:
Looks like they didn't have time to notify the others.

Dobermann:
...Well done, Dr. {@nickname}.

Dobermann:
I really should review your capabilities more objectively.

Medic:
Huh? Amiya... she's heading over to them...

Amiya:
Are you okay?

Female:
Huh? Oh, thank you...

Amiya:
No problem. It's our...

Female:
You... You're also an Infected?

Female:
What do you want?! Don't hurt my children... I'm begging you, please don't hurt us...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Find a safe place to hide.

Female:
*Crying* ... Please have mercy... Let us go...

Medic:
...

Amiya:
Has everyone gotten enough rest?

Medic:
Ah, I'm fine...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Dr. {@nickname}...

Amiya:
You've also asked a similar question before.

Amiya:
Because I... am an Infected.

Amiya:
Dobermann and I, and most of the members of Rhodes Island, are as well.

Amiya:
Even those Reunion members who we just fought...

Amiya:
We've contracted a terrible illness. Something that terrifies most people...

Amiya:
'Oripathy.'

Dobermann:
Those who have contracted Oripathy are called the 'Infected.'

Amiya:
Dobermann...

Dobermann:
Ursus has always treated the Infected harshly.

Dobermann:
I mean, who doesn't? Ursus just happens to be particularly cold-blooded about it.

Dobermann:
Civilians are taught to fear the Infected through propaganda. Nobody even bats an eyelid when the Infected are hunted down, and some even cheer for it.

Dobermann:
That's why Reunion chose this place...

Amiya:
However... this time, it's not just a simple protest anymore.

Dobermann:
They've begun to resort to large-scale violence.

Dobermann:
When Ursus puts an end to the rioting, the Infected in Chernobog will only face more cruelty.

Dobermann:
...In contrast, with you here, Dr. {@nickname}, perhaps Rhodes Island's situation will improve.

Dobermann:
Both Kal'tsit and Amiya have mentioned that you are a cutting-edge Oripathy researcher.

Dobermann:
...But with your memory loss, I doubt whether you'll be of any use again.

Amiya:
Ugh... Instructor, that's way too harsh!

Dobermann:
...Perhaps you'll be able to master the theories again after some reviewing, just like how you relearned your commanding skills?

Dobermann:
After all, you are our field commander...

Dobermann:
To be honest, I never thought a neurology doctor could also be a master tactician...

Dobermann:
But after seeing you, I can somehow understand it.

Dobermann:
I mean, Rhodes Island itself is very similar to your field of study.

Medic:
Hey! Damn you! Stop running! It's time for your injection!

Guard:
Huh? Huh? I told you, I'm fine! I, I don't need treatment yet!

Medic:
You need to get your regular injection to slow your symptoms!

Medic:
Didn't you say you were feeling dizzy?

Guard:
That's not the same condition at all!

Medic:
What if you start having other issues when you're in battle?

Medic:
For the sake of everyone's safety, you have to take care of yourself too!

Guard:
...

Medic:
Stop right there! I'm giving you the shot!

Guard:
Aaah! !

Dobermann:
...

Dobermann:
...This is what Rhodes Island does. We're looking for a cure to the infection, as well as mitigating the problems associated with the Infected.

Amiya:
That's right. It is not enough to only conduct research, or only try to resolve conflicts.

Amiya:
We must address all of the problems surrounded the Infected.

Amiya:
This is the only way for Rhodes Island to give all the Infected a chance at survival...

Dobermann:
We understand them better than most others because we, like them, are also Infected.

Dobermann:
No matter who is involved or what is required, Rhodes Island seeks to put an end to the spread of hatred and disease.

Dobermann:
Dr. {@nickname}, perhaps this will be your calling as well.

Dobermann:
...At least, this is my wish.

Dobermann:
We will give you plenty of time to let all of this sink in.

Dobermann:
However, the time given to us is scarce.

Dobermann:
Gather up, everyone. We're leaving!

Dobermann:
Anything could happen on our way to the meeting point!

Dobermann:
(Amiya...)

Dobermann:
(The situation in Chernobog has become very complicated. We can't afford to create extra pressure for the rescue team. But...)

Amiya:
(How much time... do we have left?)

Dobermann:
(...Three hours.)

Dobermann:
(After three hours, this entire city will be consumed by the Catastrophe.)

Dobermann:
(After that, everything will be over then.)

???:
......

???:
We've found some unknown variables.

???:
Notify the others, now.

???:
We're going after them.
