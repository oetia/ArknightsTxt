6:00am

Kal'tsit:
You're right. We're on a tight schedule.

Amiya:
Um... we do that sometimes.

Amiya:
But the core city is on the move. It will be hard to get into the foundation levels.

Kal'tsit:
If the operators stand on the sand and wait for the city to pass over them, both height and speed are going to be an issue.

Kal'tsit:
If they can't open the maintenance hatches and waste chutes on the underside, our distraction and our camouflage won't be worth anything.

Kal'tsit:
So our five teams will take a vehicle and use the cover of the sandstorm to approach the city, then employ special equipment to climb into the city superstructure.

Kal'tsit:
We're in no hurry to get the attention of the local Ursus brass.

Kal'tsit:
And we wouldn't want them to send out an attack ship to smash Rhodes Island in the wilderness and kill our employees.

Kal'tsit:
Even if they did that, you wouldn't see a single report on it in any newspaper. The bankers and insurance executives will quietly cross out your name and shove all the lucre into their own nest eggs.

Kal'tsit:
No one will speak of you. No one wants to upset Ursus.

Kal'tsit:
Our neutrality gives us some freedom to move in the cracks between forces, and that means we can't be backed by any power.

Kal'tsit:
We survive by working in secret. Just like when we sent those teams to save you.

Kal'tsit:
Five teams. Leave tracks, cover the tracks; objective complete, objective failed. No matter what, Rhodes Island only ever deploys five teams.

Kal'tsit:


Kal'tsit:
Even for a city-state like Lungmen, wiping us out would be a trifle.

Kal'tsit:
You saw the L.G.D. They're as strong as any country's special forces. They certainly have a pharmaceutical company beat.

Kal'tsit:
Because this is about the Infected.

Kal'tsit:
Rhodes Island has departed Lungmen, and we're bearing on the next trade port at fifteen kilometers per hour.

Kal'tsit:
We'll be in the wilderness for a few weeks before we get there.

Kal'tsit:
Aside from some nearby Rhodes Island communications specialists and some trusted vessels, no one will pick up our signal. We'll plot a course around all the nomadic cities' known paths.

Kal'tsit:
Even if Lungmen decides to betray us, they won't be able to find us.

Kal'tsit:
Right. We will need something else to tip the scales.

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
The both of you turned pretty gloomy, huh?

Amiya:
I know how serious this is, but you don't have to... smile like that, do you?

Kal'tsit:
Amiya... did I smile?

Amiya:
I know you did. Your lips may not have moved, but I could feel it.

Kal'tsit:
So here we are.

Amiya:
...Yay!

Kal'tsit:
No, I have to say this: I do not intend to rebuild any sort of relationship with this person.

Amiya:
*Sigh*...

Kal'tsit:
Myself, Amiya, and three of our elite operators will lead the five teams.

Kal'tsit:
We have three combat teams, one recon team, and one spec ops team.

Kal'tsit:
You may want to meet the leader of one of those teams.

Blaze:
Rosmontis! Wait!

Rosmontis:
Oh... Blaze.

Rosmontis:
You're badly wounded. Why are you here? You should go back. Go on.

Blaze:
Are you going to sortie this time?

Rosmontis:
Yes.

Blaze:
I'll get someone to replace you. How about Misery? He's better at assault ops than you.

Blaze:
He'll wave his hand and it'll be all done. Let's have him go.

Rosmontis:
You don't want me to go?

Blaze:
Yeah. You shouldn't.

Rosmontis:
You're giving me a weird feeling, Blaze.

Blaze:
This isn't like the missions you went on before!

Rosmontis:
Because I might die?

Blaze:
Watch it!

Blaze:
You can't just... like... you can't just come out and say it like that!

Blaze:
You're too young for such a dangerous mission. It's not right!

Rosmontis:
But Amiya's going too.

Blaze:
That's because she...! She's...!

Blaze:
She's...

Blaze:
Amiya...

Rosmontis:
She's just like me. She's Infected. She's an operator.

Rosmontis:
And I checked the logs. Ace and Scout are both in Chernobog. They didn't come back.

Rosmontis:
That means they're gone.

Rosmontis:
I want to see. I want to know what happened. I want to see who's running Reunion. I want to know who did what.

Rosmontis:
I want to know what happened to Ace and Scout.

Blaze:
Rosmontis? You don't have to record... that kind of stuff.

Rosmontis:
...Blaze?

Blaze:
Shit. What the hell am I saying...?

Blaze:
No, sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Damn my big mouth!

Blaze:
But, their deaths... They...

Rosmontis:
Blaze.

Blaze:
I'm the one who's wrong. We have happy memories, and painful ones too. You have to remember them both.

Rosmontis:
You're weird, Blaze. Your words are all scattered and broken.

Blaze:
...I don't want to see you hurting so much. Why do you have to look back at them? You... you can let go of those memories.

Blaze:
You can put them there, leave them there, and don't look back.

Rosmontis:
If I don't look... then what's the point in recording them?

Rosmontis:
If I don't look... then they're forgotten.

Rosmontis:
I won't forget. I definitely won't forget a single death.

Blaze:
Ha. Right. You're like me. You're a Rhodes Island elite operator.

Blaze:
I can't go in your place. Really, I...

Blaze:
Nng... ugh...

Rosmontis:
You're bleeding again?

Blaze:
It's fine.

Rosmontis:
I'll take you.

Blaze:
Oof.

Blaze:
Rosmontis... You and Amiya look after yourselves.

Rosmontis:
Right. I will.

Amiya:
Dr. {@nickname}...

Amiya:
Rhodes Island's elite operators, for whatever reason, dedicate their talent and energy to the Rhodes Island project.

Amiya:
The teams they bring with them fully support their work. Because our elite operators, to a certain degree, can directly determine how we use a certain tactic.

Amiya:
But not all of them are... exactly as we imagine them.

Amiya:
You've met Elite Operator Blaze, Doctor. There are a lot of rumors about her, maybe you haven't heard. The truth is, they're a little exaggerated.

Amiya:
But everyone has a different impression of her.

Amiya:
But Doctor, I think... I think you're capable of understanding her choices.

Kal'tsit:
——

Kal'tsit:
Judging by your reaction, you may have already met the one we're talking about.

Amiya:
Oh? Huh...

Amiya:
Then... we're okay?

Amiya:
That's the basic plan. Honestly, um... it's practical. A plan's a plan, an operation's an operation.

Kal'tsit:
But the op is what matters. A plan is just a basic outline of an operation. And a misstep during an operation can shatter a plan.

Engineering Operator:
Uh oh... that ain't good! We have a problem!

Engineering Operator:
Dust density is still too low. This isn't going to work with that light angle.

Engineering Operator:
We're in the open here! If they look down from the bridge, they might spot us before we're fully operational!

Rhodes Island Operator:
But we can't cover the machine any more than it already is. If we block the airflow, we won't get enough of a current going to kick up the dust!

Engineering Operator:
What do we do? Should we keep moving back...? We might not have time!

Nearl:
...I'll take care of it.

Nearl:
Firewatch, keep an eye out, and tell me which way to adjust.

Firewatch:
Lady? What... are you doing?

Nearl:
Fixing the angle of the light

Nearl:
To mitigate the suffering of the world... I believe even the sun itself will bow to me.

Elysium:
Oh? Who's that on the dune? Nearl? They're not saddling up and not falling back?

Elysium:
What's she doing? Meditating? Posing... is she posing here?

Elysium:
...No, wait, what's that light? Her whole body is glowing... No, uh oh! Too bright!

Elysium:
Um, thanks, Captain...

Elysium:
Thanks for covering my eyes, but it would be great if you weren't squeezing like you wanted to crush my skull.

Elysium:
What is Nearl doing?

Elysium:
She's okay? Well... you say that, Captain, but that light is brighter than the sun. What is she up to?

Elysium:
Huh? No way... she's pulling in all the light around us?

Elysium:
Woah.

Elysium:
Captain, all the light is starting to form together.

Elysium:
I know. I'm just saying, could anyone but the Radiant Knight do something like this?

Elysium:
Captain, look at the shadows of the sand dunes. Can you even tell what time of day it is?

Elysium:
*Sigh*... I'm just trying to brighten the mood here. And once we kick up that sandstorm, we won't be able to see the shadows, right?

Elysium:
Shutting up. Sorry.

Dobermann:
Take us up! We've got some weird-colored balls clipping us!

Pilot:
Don't be scared, Instructor. Reunion casters aren't good enough to shoot us down.

Dobermann:
We're just a distraction, no need to put on an air show for Reunion!

Pilot:
Put on a good enough show and Reunion might just surrender, huh?

Pilot:
Isn't that what they call a show of force?

Dobermann:
Aerial acrobatics isn't a show of force!

Pilot:
Hold on tight, Instructor!

Dobermann:
—I need a barf bag!

Nearl:
The device is fully functional! Amiya, we're ready to move!

Amiya:
Roger!

Kal'tsit:
Drivers, maintain a steady speed! Check your maps. Use the sandstorm to cover your approach to the core city until you're in range to deploy boarding gear! Engage!

Amiya:
The sand will cover our tracks. Remember your protective gear, and don't let sand into our sensitive equipment!

Amiya:
But... I can see the sun. Why is the sunlight breaking through the sandstorm?

Amiya:
The underside of the core city is so clear, it's like... Arts.

Amiya:
This wasn't... part of the plan. Is that natural light?

Nearl:
...Don't worry about it!

Amiya:
Roger that! Grappling hooks, prepare to fire! Operators, make sure the cables are securely fixed to the underside of the city!

Amiya:
Once all our operators are aboard, the vehicles will depart at once! I don't usually say things like this, but I'm pretty sure that light just now is a good omen for us!

Nearl:
...Definitely!

Nearl:
(I made it a little too intense and had to aim it at the ground, but let's not tell her that part...)

Nearl:
Hold on, the core city is speeding up?

Nearl:
Our machines are wind-driven, but they can only keep the sandstorm up within a one kilometer range! If they break that range, they'll spot us for sure!

Amiya:
Hurry up, everyone!

Pilot:
We're out of time! We have to slow down!

Pilot:
If we drive out of the sandstorm,, Chernobog's optical detection system will pick us right up and blow the whole op!

Pilot:
How many people do you have left? Hurry up and...

Pilot:
Huh?

Pilot:
It's too dangerous, Doctor!

Pilot:
You've never had operator training! We can't send you up there alone!

Pilot:
Didn't Dr. Kal'tsit assign you any battlefield support?

Kal'tsit:
I did.

Kal'tsit:
Me.

Kal'tsit grabbed by the waist with one arm and pulled you onto the zipline with the other.

Kal'tsit:
Seize your own fate next time, Dr. {@nickname}.

The sandstorm was ferocious, and the 'arm' holding you was very hard. You couldn't be certain it belonged to Kal'tsit.

Amiya:
All squads, take your positions!

Amiya:
There is no room for error in the operation to come!

10:30 a.m.

Core City Foundation

Rhodes Island Operator:
Yeah, this is definitely a sign of someone breaking in here.

Rhodes Island Operator:
Confirmed one infiltrator.

Amiya:
We can't be sure if that bloodstain over there is Reunion's or someone else's. It hasn't turned yet.

Amiya:
It very well could be Officer Ch'en's! We have to hurry.

Amiya:
Oh, Doctor!

Amiya:
I'm glad you made it here safe.

Amiya:
...Oh? Huh?!

Amiya:
Th-that dangerous, huh? Did you get hurt, Dr. {@nickname}?!
