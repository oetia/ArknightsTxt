Heidi:
This way, through the smoke! Follow the light of the fire!

Londinium Citizen:
Devil...!

W:
What's this? An egg mixer?

W:
Did you think you could hurt a Sarkaz mercenary with a toy like this?

Londinium Citizen:
S-Stay back!

Heidi:
Calm down. Over here, behind me.

Heidi:
This one's on our side... for now.

W:
Your side? Better not be too sure of yourself on that one.

Heidi:
W... it would be wise if you made an effort to be easier to work with. That is, if you hope to get any information out of me.

W:
That's a pretty roundabout threat there...

W:
Say... you wouldn't happen to be Kal'tsit's illegitimate daughter, would you?

Heidi:
What are you—

W:
Nah, you two look nothing alike. Plus, how could that icy old hag have any kids?

W:
Screw it. No way I could ever get buddy buddy with a lady like you.

Heidi:
Suits me just fine.

W:
Don't you worry, I won't be here long. I know how much my head's worth in merc circles, and I'm not in a generous mood.

W:
Alright, there.

Heidi:
Bombs... you buried more bombs. Did you blow up the other paths?

Heidi:
Where are your men? Aren't they still fighting the Sarkaz in the plant?

W:
Do you really want to know?

Heidi:
......

W:
Explaining the whole deal would be a huge pain. Let's skip right to the good part.

W:
They're all dead.

Heidi:
Dead?

W:
Did you think it would be easy to scoop you out of there? I lost most of the Londinium recruits I picked up the past few months in that nasty old factory.

W:
So this had better be worth it. Can we go now?

Heidi:
Let me do a head count...

Heidi:
Alright, everyone in the southern plant escaped.

W:
I was hired to snag you, not an entire congregation. Tell Kal'tsit I'm charging double for this mess.

W:
Bring your hooded monster and let's—what are you standing around for?

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
W, was it you who blew up this path?

W:
Duh. Not about to give our pursuers any chances.

Amiya:
But Feist and his team just left.

W:
Oh, come on... getting lost like this, at your age?

Horn:
What's the situation, Blake?

Victorian Soldier:
They're down.

Horn:
Good. Keep moving.

Victorian Soldier:
Horn, to your left!

Sarkaz Warrior:
Dublinn... I'll have your head!

Horn:
Not Dublinn here. Not that you'll get the chance to wallow in your disappointment.

Victorian Soldier:
Another? How many Sarkaz bodies have we seen?

Horn:
26.

Victorian Soldier:
All Dublinn?

Horn:
Looks like it.

Victorian Soldier:
Horn, I don't know how to put this, but...

Horn:
Dublinn saved us a lot of effort.

Horn:
There's no shame in admitting it. How long have you been with me here in Sudean? We need to use every means at our disposal if we want to survive.

Horn:
Come on, left door here.

Horn:
Ready?

Victorian Soldier:
—

Victorian Soldier:
Clear.

Horn:
Good. Now the right side.

Horn:
Watch the corners, Robben. I don't want any surprises.

Robben:
Roger.

Horn:
Go!

Prisoner:
*Cough* G-Go away, devil! We're not talking!

Horn:
Found them.

Prisoner:
Y-You're...

Horn:
Friends.

Prisoner:
I never thought... we heard sounds of fighting, saw the flicker of Arts... I thought it was some new devil torture method.

Horn:
Sorry we couldn't get here earlier.

Horn:
Can you stand, soldier?

Prisoner:
Soldier... haven't heard that in a long time.

Prisoner:
You an officer? You've got nerve to come here—

Horn:
—

Robben:
What are you doing? We're here to save you!

Prisoner:
Save me? Why? So I can get tricked again? So I can die in your next plot with the foreigners?

Prisoner:
In your dreams, 'sir'! We'd rather die here!

Horn:
Very well.

Horn:
Robben, your crossbow.

Robben:
Horn? What are you—

Horn:
Ammo is precious and not to be wasted.

Horn:
But these are compatriots, loyal soldiers of Victoria.

Horn:
If their last wish is to die here, then we'll grant it.

Prisoner:
......

Horn:
......

Prisoner:
You'll really kill me?

Horn:
Yes.

Horn:
You'll die as you wish in this dark room, forgotten by Londinium.

Horn:
You'll turn to bleached bones in this old abandoned factory, until the dust and dirt bury you.

Prisoner:
......

Horn:
Or, you could do something different with this crossbow.

Horn:
You could take it, come with us, and fight your way out.

Horn:
Perhaps you'll still get your wish and die trying.

Horn:
But you'll have a chance to see the night sky, breathe the air full with the smell of rust and oil—

Horn:
And think about your loved ones, breathing that same air.

Horn:
I swear on my life that they'll remember what you gave.

Prisoner:
......

Prisoner:
Yes... they... they could still be alive...

Prisoner:
I...

Horn:
Have you made your choice? Time's flying.

Prisoner:
......

Prisoner:
I'll go with you. Give me a weapon.

Horn:
What about the others? Are you coming too?

Horn:
Good. Blake, you have seven... nine new men.

Horn:
Tell me your names before we move out, soldiers.

Amiya:
Closure, have you made contact with the Self-Salvation Corps team?

Drone:
Hold on... I just got this drone restarted... it's different from the other one...

Amiya:
This isn't good.

Amiya:
Heidi, lead the other civilians out of here. The 3rd regiment will be waiting—

Amiya:
W?

W:
Hey, all the mines I left behind got blown up! Do you know what that means? Means a lotta guys are chasing us right now.

W:
Using up my men wasn't enough for you, huh? You gotta use up my bombs too?

Amiya:
Alright, five minutes it is.

Amiya:
Closure, get in touch with Feist and tell him that he and Rockrock need to be back within 5 minutes.

Amiya:
Doctor, we'll have to join the battle.

Feist:
Bill, be honest with me... have you put on weight? You're heavier than I thought...

Bill:
Hehe... how about this?

Feist:
Hey, that's better.

Feist:
What did you do? Some magic trick?

Bill:
Ha, just a change of posture... *cough*

Feist:
A-Alright, just stay put, don't open your wounds.

Feist:
When I saw you lying in that pool of blood, I thought...

Bill:
Thought I was dead?

Bill:
Ha... those devils don't got the skills... it's just... ouch...

Feist:
Take a break, don't talk anymore.

Feist:
Have you found an exit, Rockrock? The Sarkaz must have done something with these rooms... I feel like we're going around in circles.

Rockrock:
I heard the sound of fighting a few minutes ago.

Rockrock:
The exit should be around here...

Bill:
Nrgh...

Feist:
Never mind what I just said, Bill. Keep talking so you don't fall asleep.

Feist:
Remember the reward you asked for? After that last win?

Bill:
Er... a fruit can?

Feist:
A FRUIT CAN? You said you wanted a mechanical metal crab to give to your niece in the City!

Bill:
Yeah, I was hungry... lucky you've got a good memory.

Feist:
Good memory? I didn't sleep at all the next few days, working on that thing between missions...

Feist:
You'd better hang in there after all the effort I put in!

Bill:
*Cough* Alright, boss... whatever you say.

Rockrock:
Footsteps!

Rockrock:
Oh no! Sarkaz—

Sarkaz Warrior:
Where did they go?

Sarkaz Warrior:
There's a blood trail. They can't have gone far.

Rockrock:
We should hurry.

Feist:
Er...

Rockrock:
Come on, Captain, I'll take the other side.

Bill:
Sigh... look at me, can't even walk without two people helping me.

Rockrock:
Don't say that. We're family, and we look out for each other.

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
Captain, they're catching up!

Feist:
Hold them off, Johnny! Gabby, you've got the grenades, right? Give us some cover!

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
Roger!

Feist:
Rockrock, has Rock-17 found a way out? We're counting on it!

Rock-17:
Right-turn here!

Feist:
Alright, to the right!

Feist:
Wait... who's talking? Rock-17? Y-You can talk?

Rock-17:
What's that, some dumb engineering joke?

Rock-17:
Took me ages to hack this drone's system... I didn't change anything, ok? The system was too simple.

Feist:
......

Rockrock:
...Closure?

Rock-17:
Yes, it's me. I didn't have a chance to install voice data onto your drone, so I have to synthesize it... not cute enough?

Rockrock:
Well... it actually sounds rather like you.

Rockrock:
Where do we go from here?

Rock-17:
Left-turn... wait, no, there are Sarkaz there. I mean enemy Sarkaz! Go back—

Rockrock:
There are even more enemies to the rear.

Rock-17:
Well then... let me think...

Rock-17:
Right, let's go upwards!

Rockrock:
Huh?

Rock-17:
Don't you have that flying gear? Er, I mean grappling hook! There's a vent above you that should allow a man to pass through...

Feist:
Should?

Feist:
We have wounded here. Gotta be sure.

Rock-17:
Well... I'll need Rockrock to take control of the drone for a moment...

Rockrock:
Alright.

Rockrock:
What do we do?

Feist:
Rockrock... do you really trust her?

Rockrock:
Do you have a better plan?

Feist:
......

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
Captain, they're coming! I can see their leader!

Feist:
Quick, open the vent!

Rock-17:
Gotcha! Rockrock, aim!

Rockrock:
Rock-17—

Feist:
Is it open?

Rockrock:
Almost.

Feist:
Again!

Rockrock:
Rock...

Rockrock:
It missed! H-How did that sword...

???:
Finally found a way out? Isn't it a little late?

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
I'll hold him off! Quick—

???:
Blind courage isn't worth much in battle.

Feist:
Johnny!

Feist:
Rockrock, the vent!

Rockrock:
I... I can't...

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
I've got two grenades left. Even the Sarkaz can't—

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
What the... the grenade got cut in half?!

Self-Salvation Corps Soldier:
Captain, this is no ordinary Sarkaz—

Feist:
Gabby!

Hoederer:
I'm just an ordinary mercenary.

Hoederer:
Did you really think you could beat Manfred or Theresis?

Hoederer:
Pretty naive.

Feist:
Sarkaz... did you think all I had was grenades?

Hoederer:
Grenades? Smoke bombs is more like it.

Hoederer:
Bombs that can hurt a Sarkaz don't look like that.

Feist:
......

Rock-17:
Feist, Rockrock, you hear me? I've recalibrated... but you only have one chance. Hold on tight!

Feist:
Rockrock—

Rockrock:
—

Rockrock:
It worked! We can go up now!

Feist:
You first!

Rockrock:
No, you're with BIll, you go first—

Feist:
Alright.

Rockrock:
You're not getting through, Sarkaz!

Rockrock:
I'll protect my family... you won't hurt them again!

Rockrock:
Rock-17!

Hoederer:
Self-destruct drone?

Hoederer:
Pathetic...

Rockrock:
Captain... go...

Hoederer:
Tell me, Feline... was it really worth it? Losing that many to save one?

Hoederer:
Every one of them called out for their captain with their last breaths.

Hoederer:
Will you take responsibility for their sacrifice?

Feist:
...I would rather none of them died.

Feist:
Hold on, Rockrock!

Rockrock:
Huh?

Hoederer:
......

Hoederer:
The grappling hook again? Smart, but not smart enough.

Hoederer:
You need better tricks to survive in battle.

Hoederer:
We'll meet again, children... you don't know it, but there's no way you'll leave this inferno.

Amiya:
Are they here, Closure?

W:
Four minutes, fifty seconds.

W:
Countdown?

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
We...

Feist:
Amiya!

Amiya:
They're here!

Amiya:
Feist? Just the three of you? The other two...

Rockrock:
......

Feist:
They won't be back.

Feist:
We need to get out of here, now!

Feist:
There's a really dangerous Sarkaz after us, and there are a lot of them... it's an ambush!

Feist:
None of us would have made it, if not for Closure...

Feist:
They knew we'd go there, and they know you're here. They're just waiting... it's a trap! We have to go, before it's too late!

W:
It's too late.

W:
Damn it, this is my last mine, and the biggest one.

W:
Stop bothering me, {@nickname}. Yes, I have one bomb left. Guess who it's for?

W:
You didn't notice the explosion sounded kinda weird? I guess there's really nothing under that tin head of yours.

W:
The guy didn't fall into my trap at all. He avoided it and disabled the Originium circuits.

W:
Need me to say it even clearer? No, it didn't take me too much effort to set up the mines...

W:
But the dragon lady was the last one to put all my mines out of commission.

W:
Talulah can't be here, can she? There's no way...

W:
Hey, what's with the face, bunny? You've got her all locked up in...

W:
Damn it, {@nickname}... damn you and damn that Kal'tsit!

W:
Congratulations, {@nickname}, you're now second on my list of people to bomb.

Amiya:
W, there's a lot of intel that we haven't shared. We need to get out of here...

W:
Get out? Easy for you to say.

W:
Be glad it's not Talulah here. I don't smell the arrogant stench of Draco fire. But...

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Surround the place!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Theta, Iota, block the path on the other side!

Amiya:
They got so many men in so little time?

Amiya:
Oh no! Doctor, Lady Heidi and the others are still inside!

Feist:
Sorry, Amiya...

Amiya:
Save that for when we get out.

Feist:
Very well.

Amiya:
Doctor, let me... W? Why are you grabbing me like that?

W:
Save your strength, bunny. Look at the gang you've got here. Artificer, wounded, garbage... who can fight?

Feist:
Y-You're right, but we'll do our best...

Rockrock:
W-We won't be a burden.

W:
Save your strength for running. You'll wanna be fast.

W:
Sigh... I didn't want to say this. It's really not my style.

W:
But I need Heidi alive. There's something I need to ask the old woman.

Amiya:
W...

W:
Go. Take your people, and pick up your trash.

Amiya:
......

Amiya:
W!

W:
Huh?

Amiya:
Good luck. We'll be waiting.

W:
You're still here? Need me to blow you up?

W:
Finally. Some peace.

W:
She talks like we're actually friends.

W:
As for you...

W:
Wanna keep blasting? At this rate, there won't be much left to bomb.

W:
What's this? A rock? Some kind of lame joke?

W:
Congratulations, you've pissed me off.

W:
I was hoping to be a little frugal today.

W:
Why don't you come out? I promise I'll leave something of you that's recognizable.

W:
Well, that was close. Only two bombs away from hitting me.

???:
You've grown again, W.

W:
Wait, what—

W:
You?!
