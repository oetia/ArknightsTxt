Amiya:
They've lost all humanity...

Rhodes Island Operator:
Amiya...

Amiya:
Yeah. I'm fine.

Amiya:
Can we still reach Blaze, Doctor, and GreyThroat?

Rhodes Island Operator:
No problem.

Amiya:
Good. Keep in touch with them. Help them find their way.

Herd:
......

Herd:
(Thirsty howling).

Amiya:
I can't feel... anything from you anymore. That faint outline of a thread of hatred, it all came from Mephisto...

Amiya:
I have to cleanse it... the poison of Mephisto's hate.

Amiya:
I promise. I will.

Ch'en:
I've finished mopping up the Reunion stragglers and reached the waypoint. But we've found the situation in the slums is not what we expected.

Ch'en:
The L. G. D. unit guarding the area found no traces of Reunion. I'm going to have to investigate myself.

Ch'en:
There's been a reduction in the Infected mutants? Is that your doing?

Ch'en:
No?

Ch'en:
Stay frosty... You never know what danger might be hiding in the shadows.

Ch'en:
Don't let your guard down. These Infected are a lot more to handle than your run-of-the-mill Reunion.

Ch'en:
Once I finish my work here, I'll send a team to assist you. Keep the channel open. Over and out.

Ch'en:
Who's there?!

L. G. D. Officer:
It's me! Reporting in!

Ch'en:
Not you...

L. G. D. Officer:
Huh...?

Ch'en:
Nothing. Report in.

L. G. D. Officer:
Yes, Sir! As ordered, we swept the area!

Ch'en:
What did you find?

L. G. D. Officer:
Nothing! Not a single Reunion footprint to be found!

Ch'en:
I told you to be on the lookout for anything unusual!

L. G. D. Officer:
Oh... Oops. We really don't know this area at all.

L. G. D. Officer:
I mean, according to procedure, we don't come in here until there's a problem so serious we have to tear down a block or something.

Ch'en:
I know... The slums don't exist to you, as long as they're quiet.

L. G. D. Officer:
......

Ch'en:
When we cut off Reunion, there was a deafening sound coming from this place, and half the residents here vanished.

Ch'en:
Look at the toys scattered around our feet... Look at this and tell me there's nothing out of the ordinary.

Ch'en:
Was there anything in the plan about evacuating all the residents of the slums?

L. G. D. Officer:
...There are a few things out of the ordinary. Most of the buildings in the district have been abandoned or otherwise ruined.

L. G. D. Officer:
The streets that are still here are completely empty. Presumably a result of crossfire between Reunion and the locals.

L. G. D. Officer:
And there have been a few fires. We have extinguished them. They seem to have been caused by household functions such as heating and cooking.

L. G. D. Officer:
All buildings show signs of forced entry, but there is no trace of any resistance from the residents.

L. G. D. Officer:
As for Reunion, there's really no sign of them at all. Just... some cleaning residue.

Ch'en:
Do you care nothing for the civilians here?

L. G. D. Officer:
...Sorry, Sir!

Ch'en:
What are you apologizing for?

L. G. D. Officer:
I don't know, Sir!

Ch'en:
Whatever... Why should you care about anyone in a place like this?

Ch'en:
Hurry up and send out some teams to lock down the area!

Ch'en:
No one gets in or out. No vehicles either. Reunion or otherwise!

Ch'en:
As for you... You come with me. We're going north.

L. G. D. Officer:
Yes, Sir!

Ch'en:
(Shh. Don't make a sound!)

Ch'en:
(This way. Quickly.)

L. G. D. Officer:
......

???:
Very perceptive.

Ch'en:
What are you doing?!

L. G. D. Officer:
Preparing to fire!

???:
You should not follow.

???:
Control your subordinates, Ch'en.

Ch'en:
......

Ch'en:
Go find Swire.

L. G. D. Officer:
But, Sir...

Ch'en:
Go!

Ch'en:
......

Ch'en:
Who sent you?

???:
I do not answer to you.

Ch'en:
You think you can run? Try and I'll arrest you on the spot.

Ch'en:
You're an unidentified armed element of unknown origin. How do you think the L. G. D. is going to treat you? We might just shoot you dead.

???:
Training a new L. G. D. unit would be a waste of Lungmen's time, treasure, and talent.

???:
And eradicating the entire L. G. D. would be a crushing blow to the heart of the Lungmen community. You should not take the risk.

Ch'en:
Hah! Is that threat supposed to scare me? Or should I be thanking you for your concern over Lungmen's future?

???:
Ch'en, the L. G. D. is the face of Lungmen, as well as a pillar of her community, and an exemplary show of her strength.

???:
And the L. G. D. should stay in its lane.

???:
Don't let it stick its nose where it doesn't belong.

Ch'en:
Your threats are really not impressing me. Hurry up and answer the question: where did all the locals go?

???:
——

Ch'en:
You're one tap of this 'alert all units' button away from making an enemy out of the entire L. G. D.

Ch'en:
Or I guess you could take a split second to knock away my sword, slice off my arm, and snatch away this transceiver.

Ch'en:
Where did all the slum dwellers go?

???:
We will withdraw from this place. Ch'en, you and I both withdraw. For now, let us not interfere with one another.

Ch'en:
And where is it you think you're going?

???:
These new-type Infected Reunion is controlling may well interfere with our carefully laid plans.

???:
We will swiftly remove them for the L. G. D., please do your part to exterminate Reunion's main force.

???:
If the L. G. D. seeks to actualize its strategic goals, it should focus on its own duties. You must do that which you must do.

Ch'en:
Wait! You think you can just leave?

Ch'en:
Come and go as you please?!

???:
Superintendent Ch'en, let me give you a suggestion.

???:
Do not seek to investigate what has happened here. I look to Lord Wei, and will banter with you no longer.

Ch'en:
——!

???:
By the way, cutting off your arm is quite simple. When you stand resolute, you are a hundred times stronger than now.

Swire:
Hey——!

Ch'en:
Stay back, Swire!

???:
......

Ch'en:
Get back here!

???:
I will see myself out.

Ch'en:
Damn it!

Swire:
What was that all about? Who was that?

Ch'en:
Lungmen's special forces are on the move. And I don't know if the people of this district are piled in a mass grave somewhere.

Swire:
Huh? What are you talking about...?

Ch'en:
Don't play dumb. You know. Or at least you've heard.

Swire:
Know what...?

Swire:
Wait, do you know?

Ch'en:
I don't know. But your grandfather definitely knows.

Swire:
Huh? Seriously, what are we even talking about? Diu ah! Just come out with it already!

Swire:
My grandpa's totally bedridden. I can't get two words out of him!

Ch'en:
Being sick in bed means he can't run Lungmen anymore? You know better than I what kind of man your grandfather is!

Swire:
No way!

Swire:
...But...

Ch'en:
Who are you thinking?

Swire:
'Lin Gray.'

Ch'en:
Hmph. Now I'm the one who gets to say 'no way!' Lin runs the slums as his personal fief. There's no way he'd let something like this happen.

Swire:
Make a few phone calls and ask around. Maybe you'll find out.

Swire:
Are you calling? Or should I?
