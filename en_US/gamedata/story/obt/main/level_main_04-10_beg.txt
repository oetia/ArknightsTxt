Jessica:
The temperature... is dropping sharply?

Jessica:
There's ice forming on the ground...

Jessica:
It's so cold...

Jessica:
Unbelievable... even the burning effigy was frozen over....!

Jessica:
The flames were put out... Dark clouds have covered the sky...

Jessica:
Aaahh...!

Amiya:
Don't panic!

Amiya:
Jessica, Blacksteel operator!

Jessica:
...

Jessica:
Yes!

Amiya:
Stay in position!

Jessica:
Roger!

Meteorite:
What are you doing, Frostleaf?!

Amiya:
She's... draining all the heat from her surroundings!

Amiya:
I never knew she was able to affect such a wide area!

Frostleaf:
Heh... Master of the Yetis...

Frostleaf:
I've never met... anyone with a lower body temperature than mine.

Meteorite:
Frostleaf!

Frostleaf:
Meteorite... To be honest, I wanted to...

Frostleaf:
Distract her... and buy some time for you...

Meteorite:
You...

Frostleaf:
But... my body... is completely frozen.

Frostleaf:
I can't... move my feet anymore.

Meteorite:
Frostleaf! !

Frostleaf:
Amiya, take them with you, and fight your way out of here.

Frostleaf:
In less than a minute, the enemy commander... will have frozen this entire square.

Frostleaf:
Don't make me die for nothing.

Meteorite:
Amiya... We can't... I won't leave her!

Amiya:
I understand.

Amiya:
I won't leave Frostleaf behind.

Amiya:
I will not... leave anyone behind!

Amiya:
I'll hold off the enemy squads' movements.

Amiya:
Meteorite... I'm counting on you to bring Frostleaf back!!

Meteorite:
Roger!

Amiya:
Doctor! Please lead our squads!

Frostleaf:
...

Frostleaf:
Now that I think about it...

Frostleaf:
I've only used these Arts once before.

Frostleaf:
'Wherever there is blood...'

FrostNova:
Hah.

FrostNova:
So you want to use your ice... to counter mine?

Frostleaf:
Nnh...!

FrostNova:
How will you do that if you can't even use your tongue anymore?

Frostleaf:
You...

FrostNova:
...

FrostNova:
Yeti Squadron, spread out.

Reunion Member:
Roger.

FrostNova:
My brethren...

FrostNova:
Flush them out, and freeze their blood.

Reunion Member:
Understood.

Amiya:
'...Your mind can hide nothing from me.'

Reunion Member:
An incantation?

Reunion Member:
The rabbit of Rhodes Island...

Reunion Member:
Black... lines? ...What the hell is that?

Reunion Member:
Wh-what kind of Arts is that--

Reunion Member:
W-wait, why is that thing... worming past our barriers? !

Reunion Member:
Don't--

Reunion Member:
...Aaaaaghh!!!!

Reunion Member:
M-my body! It's on fire...! It's burning!

Amiya:
Meteorite!

Meteorite:
I know!

Meteorite:
Please, keep distracting them!

Reunion Member:
N-n-no... so cold...!

Reunion Member:
Nnngh... it hurts so much!

Reunion Member:
...Gaah... No, no more...

FrostNova:
...!

FrostNova:
Hurry! Don't let them hurt our comrades any further!

Reunion Member:
Understood!

FrostNova:
Your Originium Arts... are very formidable.

FrostNova:
...

Frostleaf:
Nnh... aagh...

Frostleaf:
Damn you... Get away... from me...

Frostleaf:
Nnnh...

Frostleaf:
...

FrostNova:
I won't give you a chance to use your Arts, girl.

FrostNova:
Now, close your eyes and sleep.

FrostNova:
I'll put you out of your misery soon.

Meteorite:
Th-this witch...!

FrostNova:
...

FrostNova:
I take it that you're Amiya.

Amiya:
...!

FrostNova:
...

FrostNova:
I like the look in your eyes.

FrostNova:
That is how a warrior should look.

Amiya:
...

FrostNova:
I'm sorry...

Amiya:
Why are you...

Amiya:

Amiya:
What's going on here?

FrostNova:
——♬——♬——

Amiya:
...It's snowing?

FrostNova:

FrostNova:
'Sleep, my children. Sleep.

FrostNova:
Hedgehog dolls and teddy bears...'......

Meteorite:
This strange melody...

Meteorite:
...She's casting her Arts!

FrostNova:
'Sink quietly into black...♪

FrostNova:
...My broken puppets and dolls♬'

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Even more shards of black ice are appearing out of thin air?!

Jessica:
The ice shards are slowly falling onto the ground!

Meteorite:
Shoot, the ground is freezing wherever the shards fall...?

Meteorite:
The black ice...

Meteorite:
It's spreading...?!

Amiya:
The ice crystals are eroding everything around us!

Amiya:
Don't let her finish her song! !
