???:
Hurry, hide!

???:
I... I need to go.

???:
Take this... this is for you.

???:
This is a protective charm. My mother taught me how to these...

???:
And this is one that I made.

???:
When you make these dolls by hand, you can keep the ones you care about safe.

Children:
Okay, sister Misha, we'll take good care of it!

Misha:
Good, good.

Misha:
Now, go hide! And don't make a sound.

Children:
Okay!

Rioter:
Where'd they go? ! After them! Let's see how far those Infected can run!

Rioter:
Hmm? Now... what do we have here?

Amiya:
According to Exusiai's data, our mission target should have been staying somewhere around here...

Amiya:
Argh, the terrain around here is really complicated. If we were doing this alone, this assignment might have been quite troublesome...

Amiya:
Luckily, I got in touch with Penguin Logistics beforehand...

Amiya:
...Who's there?

Amiya:
Those people are...!

Child:
Baddies! You bunch of baddies! Let go of me! Let... Go...!

Rioter:
Tell me! Where'd she run off to?

Rioter:
Stop playing dumb!

Child:
Sister! Sister! Where are you...! Help...

Child:
Sister Misha! Sister Misha, save me!!

Amiya:
...

Rioter:
Who is it?

Rioter:
Get back here!

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...You should leave right now if you know what's good for you.

Rioter:
...?!

Rioter:
Who the hell...?!

Rioter:
You don't like you're from around here!

Rioter:
You're not afraid of us...

Amiya:
Otherwise...

Rioter:
Huh?

Rioter:
Gaaah!!

Rioter:
Wh-what was that?

Rioter:
Arts! Sh-she's using Arts?!

Rioter:
Aaaargh! Stay away from me!

Amiya:
...Don't bully the defenseless ever again.

Rioter:
Aaaagh! Monster!

Amiya:
Heh... Monster, huh?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Everything will be okay. You can come out now.

Amiya:
It's dangerous here. You should hurry and find some place safe.

Children:
Thank you, ma'am!

Amiya:
Take care!

Franka:
Amiya, what's going on?

Amiya:
Hm, I saw an Infected just now, probably unregistered...

Franka:
From Ursus?

Amiya:
Yes. She was heading deeper into the slums.

Amiya:
Franka, gather the nearby operators.

Franka:
Okay.

Amiya:
The deeper we head into the slums, the more volatile things are going to be...

Amiya:
There are ordinary civilians, criminals, and refugees - all mixed together.

Amiya:
We'll have to make thorough preparations.

Liskarm:
Amiya, we have incoming comms.

Liskarm:
Please wait a second.

Liskarm:
...

Liskarm:
That's right.

Liskarm:
Amiya, it's the L.G.D.

Amiya:
Was that Madam Ch'en?

Liskarm:
Indeed.

Liskarm:
... That's right. We've already found a number of unregistered Infected.

Liskarm:
... Yes.

Liskarm:
... What?

Liskarm:
... We're after an Ursus girl, short white hair, height of about 145 cm, called Misha?

Amiya:
That's...?

Liskarm:
...Understood.

Liskarm:
Amiya, Madam Ch'en wants us to immediately search for the Infected just described.

Liskarm:
Once we find her, we are to turn her in to the L.G.D. immediately.

Amiya:
Can I speak to her please?

Amiya:
Hello, hello...

Amiya:
Madam Ch'en, can you hear me?

Ch'en:
I hear you.

Amiya:
Can I confirm the validity of that order?

Ch'en:
100% valid, effective immediately.

Amiya:
I see.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
She suddenly hung up...

Franka:
That Ch'en, she's got a bit of a temper.

Amiya:
So this is going to be our mission for now...

Liskarm:
Amiya, I've just received another message from several defenders.

Liskarm:
They met some individuals who were openly hostile to Rhodes Island's operators.

Liskarm:
Furthermore, those attackers weren't ordinary people, they were... Infected.

Amiya:
... Have the defenders fall back towards us.

Amiya:
Scout team! Our target is an Ursusian girl with short white hair, height of 145 cm. Remember to stay hidden, and stay safe!

Amiya:
Other operators, follow your leaders and spread out.

Franka:
Hey... Not bad.

Franka:
Liskarm, this kid's pretty smart.

Liskarm:
... Dr. {@nickname} is our tactical commander. You should take this more seriously.

Amiya:
Let's begin.

Amiya:
So... Rhodes Island has to fight against the Infected again...
