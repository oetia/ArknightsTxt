Manfred:
So you mean to say that Hoederer has failed?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Yes, General. I saw it with my own eyes. He was gravely wounded in the battle just now.

Manfred:
And he was in contact with another Sarkaz woman, aside from his longtime mercenary acquaintance?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Right. But she's... highly skilled at concealment, and moves too quickly.

Sarkaz Warrior:
I was anxious about getting too close. Couldn't shake the feeling she'd notice me with one wrong step.

Manfred:
Wise choice. You wouldn't have made it back alive otherwise.

Manfred:
That said, I'm surprised the Confessarius let Babel's assassin go free. Was that an oversight, or their intent?

Manfred:
...No matter.

Manfred:
Tell me about Hoederer. Where is he?

Sarkaz Warrior:
He's still marshaling the remaining mercenaries, and about to resume pursuing the escaped convicts.

Manfred:
Have him return. Those convicts will not stay free forever.

Sarkaz Warrior:
General?

Manfred:
As you said, his wounds are no laughing matter.

Sarkaz Warrior:
Forgive me, but why do you still trust Hoederer so much?

Manfred:
I've had you with him this whole time.

Manfred:
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you've never once reported any misdeeds from him.

Sarkaz Warrior:
But he used to work for Babel!

Sarkaz Warrior:
It was the mercenaries under his watch that screwed up, and it was his old friend that incited them! Don't you think it's too risky to keep him in such a key position, General?

Manfred:
You've seen for yourself today. How does one Victorian regard another?

Sarkaz Warrior:
Urgh...

Manfred:
And how much more difficult do you think it is for one Sarkaz to trust another?

Manfred:
We've had everything stolen from us, been forced to grow accustomed to fighting each other for the right to survive.

Manfred:
And now, we've obtained a new opportunity.

Manfred:
You tell me, do you want to go back to monitoring a possible Sarkaz spy, or will you accompany me in eliminating the remaining Victorian threats?

Sarkaz Warrior:
......

Sarkaz Warrior:
General, we choose to go with you.

Feist:
*pant*... *pant*... Did we shake them?

Amiya:
We can't let our guards down yet, Mr. Feist.

Feist:
I know... *huff*... I know.

Rockrock:
...Captain.

Feist:
What is it?

Rockrock:
Your face is splattered in blood.

Feist:
Blood?! Hey, Bill... Bill?

Bill:
Nrgh...

Feist:
...Oh, it's just my own blood. No need to panic, then.

Feist:
Come on, Bill, you could breathe a little louder! I don't want to have spent all this effort porting a dead man back.

Bill:
Then think about... swinging your spanner gentler.

Bill:
You're always... hitting me... in the head...

Feist:
I hear you. You're the boss today.

Feist:
Hold on a little longer... we'll be right back home soon. Right? I'm not going blind, am I?

Feist:
Eugh, this blood from my forehead's getting in my eyes a little... Rockrock, eyes out. How much left to our target rendezvous?

Rockrock:
A little over 300 meters and we're there.

Feist:
It's Team 6 on guard here, right? I could really use a hand from them. Bill, old bud, you're getting harder to carry by the second.

Siege:
...How long have we gone without a signal from the surface team?

Indra:
Didn't the Doctor say they'd only contact us after they reach that last RDV?

Siege:
No, I mean the Self-Salvation Corps, at the one before that.

Siege:
We had an agreement that they'd keep us up to date with the surface situation every half hour.

Indra:
Shit, I wasn't tracking the time! How long's it been?

Siege:
...We need to go up and see.

Indra:
No!

Siege:
If the Sarkaz have already discovered our last rendezvous, then the Doctor's squad is in danger. You're clearly worried sick about Morgan and Dagda too.

Indra:
A... And you too!

Indra:
Worst comes to worst, Vina, I go peek, and you stay here. Suppose somehow something's happened, you scarper further in...

Siege:
Indra, I can't always keep cowering behind you all. First our mentor, then you and the Glasgow Gang, now the Doctor—

Siege:
—I've cowered for far too long, and I know it. Dagda wasn't talking nonsense. If you're always tucked away in the shadows, you gradually lose the courage to directly face the sun.

Indra:
She's trying to nark you! You know what she's dying for? You, taking her to storm the Palace, and finding that what's-his-gent to do him in!

Siege:
And you're itching to go back to the Glasgow Gang. Don't you understand her point of view?

Indra:
I... Like hell I don't, but that's the bloody thing. I understand, and that's why...

Siege:
You're scared she'll end up killing herself, the way she rushes it.

Indra:
You can bloody imagine, can't you? She's got a death wish in my eyes, the way she acts!

Siege:
...You need to trust her.

Siege:
She'll be willing to live for our sake... and the sake of so many, even if it comes with enormous pain.

Siege:
She's an outstanding knight, and a warrior of Victoria. She has everything in common with the countless others who struggle to live, and fight on for Victoria.

Siege:
And I... I have to fight with them. Not because I'm in some special position, but because we're all 'native' to this land.

Indra:
Vina...

Siege:
Think of that commander, Lady Clovisia. Would she abandon her soldiers, run off just to keep herself safe?

Indra:
I'm not familiar with her... but I don't imagine she would. Those soldiers really trust in her.

Siege:
Then in your eyes, how much do I pale in comparison?

Indra:
Like bloody hell you pale at all!

Siege:
Then follow me. Together, we'll make sure that our comrades-in-arms have a safe trip home.

Mandragora:
We finally get to leave this stinking place soon.

Mandragora:
Are you alright, 'Spy'?

Taran Secret Agent:
...Whoof... *huff*... I'm fine, Mandragora.

Taran Secret Agent:
The last few times I've heard the word 'spy' it's been from a Sarkaz thinking up some fresh new punishment. I almost forgot it was my codename.

Mandragora:
Then pick a more tasteful one next time, if you have the chance. 'The Elocutionist' and all that lot had good ones, and they kicked the bucket without leaving so much as a smear.

Taran Secret Agent:
Haha...

Mandragora:
Save your strength for now. The Leader still needs the Sarkaz intel you found.

Taran Secret Agent:
You mean... The Shard...

Mandragora:
No, don't say it.

Mandragora:
Not like I don't want to hear, but... we need the Leader's approval. Our soldiers are all clean sorts. Don't go giving them too big a burden to carry.

Taran Secret Agent:
I understand... Mandragora... you've always been such a good girl.

Mandragora:
Don't sweet-talk me like 'The Bandit' did. Sick of it. They're all gone and now I'm stuck here alone in this shithole having to worry about the Leader.

Mandragora:
At least you got back quick. While you were gone, that Harmonie bastard was glued to the Leader's side day and night, and I was terrified that... that...

Taran Secret Agent:
Terrified... that what?

Mandragora:
That the Leader would get too close to those noble sorts, and that someday, she'd have no more use for us.

Taran Secret Agent:
The Leader, eh... *sigh*...

Dublinn Soldier:
Ma'am, I've ascertained the others' positions. They're still in the same place, watching the door for the Sarkaz. Are we linking up with them right now?

Mandragora:
Mm. Get the paramedics going. 'The Spy' needs immediate treatment.

Mandragora:
Right, one more thing. Find a Messenger and notify Count Mourning outside the city immediately. We have to ensure 'The Spy' meets the Leader as soon as possible.

Taran Secret Agent:
Count Mourning? You... involved him for the Leader?

Mandragora:
Tch. Times like these, we have no choice but to hope the nobles do something to help. Funny kind of joke, isn't it?

Taran Secret Agent:
*cough* *cough*... You... You've grown well...

Mandragora:
That's not like you, 'Spy'. You're speaking too much rubbish. Save the rest for when you're not ragged enough to drop dead at a stiff breeze.

Horn:
...Hold it.

Robben:
What is it, Horn? We have a visual on the exit already.

Horn:
Mind the perimeter.

Robben:
......

Horn:
Three o'clock!

Robben:
Horn, it's Sarkaz!

Horn:
—

Horn:
Robben, are you still fine for ammo?

Robben:
Ha... haha... sorry, Horn. Truth is, I've been hiding an explosive shell on me.

Robben:
All this time, I've had it in my head that if I fall into the enemy's hands at some point again... I'll be taking this shell with me to my last stand.

Horn:
...Shame, we improvised that shell ourselves.

Robben:
How's that got anything to do with—

Horn:
And I'm very sorry, but I'm not inclined to give you that opportunity.

Robben:
Eh? My shell—

Horn:
Looks like the power of a homemade one falls a bit short after all.

Robben:
But... but he's unscathed, how?

Robben:
That Sarkaz...

Horn:
That Sarkaz is their beloved General.

Manfred:
We finally meet. An improvised shell is hardly a suitable greeting though.

Horn:
I know you've met your share of Victorian soldiers, Sarkaz. After all, a great deal of them died by your hands. I imagine their spirits are practically lining up to crowd your dreams.

Manfred:
No need to be so self-effacing, White Wolf of Victoria.

Horn:
......

Manfred:
Even to the Sarkaz, you qualify as a heroic warrior.

Manfred:
As I recall, the captain who rendered Kazdel a sea of flames once more, two hundred years ago, was your ancestor.

Horn:
Are you some monster who's lived for centuries too?

Manfred:
I had no chance to witness that war.

Horn:
But listen to the way you talk about it. It's no different from your kin who feed on others' lives to prolong their own.

Manfred:
'Those stained in Sarkaz blood must pay that blood back, thousands of times over.'

Manfred:
Where do you think we came from, Victorian? Just who runs in fear at the restless souls circling Londinium's skies day and night, murmuring their blood feuds?

Horn:
Did you know? I became a professional soldier precisely because I was fed up with justifying this war we're in.

Horn:
Come, Sarkaz.

Horn:
The words of the deceased lingering about my ears are more than you'll ever hear.

Horn:
And I promised them... I promised them this.

Horn:
I will not fall until I see my people out of this place alive.
