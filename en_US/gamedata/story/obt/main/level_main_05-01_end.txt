Rhodes Island Cabin #7, Lok Tai Chau, Lungmen Harbor

Swire:
I teamed up with Rhodes Island to clear out the Reunion forces that were blocking your way. Your squad is pretty much fine as well. Heheh~ You can finally go back to Lungmen.

Swire:
Just when you thought that everything had settled down, you took a blast head-on and got knocked out.

Ch'en:
...Really?

Swire:
Are you asking if you really let someone sneak up on you like that, or if you really managed to get hit with explosives but only end up unconscious?

Ch'en:
Forget it, stop pulling my leg. What's the situation in Lungmen now?

Swire:
It's a terrible mess. Read the report yourself if you'd like.

Swire:
Regardless of what happened before, the fact is that our counterattack has been significantly set back because of you.

Swire:
Right now, the Special Ops Division should be assembling the remainder of your squad, then joining up with the rest of the L.G.D. along with Rhodes Island.

Hoshiguma:
So we'll be fighting our way straight to the heart of the city. Maneuver warfare, huh? That does seem promising.

Hoshiguma:
What's the purpose of that kind of strategy though?

Swire:
Destroying all of Reunion's rally points. We'll fully utilize the advantage you've created for us.

Hoshiguma:
In other words, a siege.

Swire:
That's right, we have to seize this opportunity when Reunion is still trying to establish a foothold.

Ch'en:
However, in doing so, we'll be forcing their remnants to converge faster.

Ch'en:
You can't guarantee that you'll be able to hold them off until the L.G.D. is reassembled, much less ensure that the Reunion remnants are all dealt with.

Ch'en:
We don't need any of your 'advantages,' nor do I need to hear you lecture me about strategies.

Swire:
You don't have a say in the matter, Ch'en. Even if you are the head of the Special Ops Divison and enjoy a certain degree of autonomy during times of war, you cannot absolve yourself of all accountability.

Ch'en:
Judging by your tone, you're trying to challenge me. I'll take you on, but not right now.

Ch'en:
We each have our own orders. The only thing that matters is that we do our job.

Swire:
Ch'en, the L.G.D. has fallen, and Reunion has taken control of the L.G.D. Headquarters. This is your fault.

Swire:
Why were you not here when Lungmen needed you?

Ch'en:
...

Swire:
Was that also an order?

Swire:
If you weren't neglecting your duties, Lungmen wouldn't have fallen.

Swire:
I'm ashamed of you, Ch'en. You should resign immediately, and let me take over the Special Ops Division.
