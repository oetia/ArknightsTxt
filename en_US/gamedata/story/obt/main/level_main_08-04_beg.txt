Hui-chieh:

If memory serves me correctly, and I don't trust it to, the old man's name was Ivan Iziaslav.

A very common name. And he was the sort of peasant farmer you could find anywhere.

But he sacrificed himself. For a whole mess of reasons, he gave his own life...

I think about it every now and then. Am I truly worth people sacrificing their lives?

Alina went with me. She was gentle most other times, but would suddenly just come out with venomous tongue-lashings. That made me uncomfortable, to say the least.

The plan was proceeding smoothly.

In accordance with my own ideas, rapidly, the Infected of this place would surely unite as one.

I hoped it would be effective.

And I hoped it would be enough for the old man to rest peacefully. Aside from the old lady, no-one else had been closer family to me.

February 7th

Third year without the Black Snake

Talulah:
Sir, I'm...

Infected:
Whatcha here for? Don't like the look of your clothes. Some old vet, are you?

Infected:
Get lost! There's nothing even left here. You lot stole it, all of it! And what you couldn't steal, you burned!

Infected:
Bastards! You came to kill me? Kill me, then! Goddamned demons!

Talulah:
No, sir, I'm here to tell you that the Infected Patrol Unit is sweeping this area today.

Infected:
Then let 'em sweep! Let 'em kill us all, why don't you!

Infected:
We built our pathetic, unlivable village all the way out here, and they still come for us! What else can we do but let 'em!?

Talulah:
Sir. You can hide yourselves, and I'll talk to them. Or I can conceal myself...

Infected:
And who're you? I always said, you military noble bunch, no matter what you pretend! You're all just out for our lives—

Infected:
Hah, you're not quite their sort. You actually talk with us! And they think we're barely even worth whipping!

Infected:
Huh? Hello?

Infected:
Gone...?

Infected:
What kind of stunt is this? Oh... damn us all...

Infected:
Damn us all. What a pathetic ending.

Infected Patrol Unit:
It's no bad thing to know your own damnation.

Infected:
Ah... Mr. Patrolman...

Infected Patrol Unit:
...Destitute and lousy. Bad physique. You wouldn't be much use even if we sent you to the mines.

Infected Patrol Unit:
How do you want to die, then? Painlessly? Slowly?

Infected:
...Mr. Patrolman! Look at me... what harm would leaving me alive do you?

Infected Patrol Unit:
You say that with a weapon in your hand?

Infected:
...Sorry, Mr. Patrolman! This was for whoever that was just a minute ago! I don't know where she's gone now, but...

Infected Patrol Unit:
Even burdenbeasts are worth more than you Infected. They can at least move goods. Your existence is a waste of His Majesty's land!

Talulah:
Why is that?

Infected Patrol Unit:
——

Infected Patrol Unit:
Where did you come from?

Talulah:
From far, far east.

Infected Patrol Unit:
What the hell are you...? You, are you Infected too?

Talulah:
I am.

Talulah:
I can think. I can speak.

Talulah:
We Infected live and die. Why should you decide when and how?

Infected Patrol Unit:
What is this bullshit?!

Talulah:
If you could let us die peacefully on our own terms, we'd hardly even be upset about it...

Talulah:
But, my Infected brother, look up at him! Look at his face, his grin, his laugh!

Talulah:
They want to decide our fates. Control us. Perhaps our lives aren't worth much, but do you think you'd be worth a single gold coin?

Infected Patrol Unit:
You!

Talulah:
My brother, in all their past outrageous acts, have they ever spared someone for their conduct? Have they ever let another live for following instructions?

Talulah:
They have not! Each time they let you live, it was only because they still saw worth they could squeeze from you!

Talulah:
With no money and no land left, they'd kick you to the floor. After all, the cities don't even give Infected the chance to live!

Talulah:
How should we Infected live? How should we die? That is for us to decide!

Infected:
......!

Infected:
But... who are you?

Infected Patrol Unit:
You good-for-nothing! Tell me your name at once!

Infected Patrol Unit:
In the name of the Emperor! For daring to lead his citizenry astray with these ludicrous ideals, we sentence you to death!

Talulah:
To my brothers, I have no name. Refer to me how you wish. If you must call me something, you may call me Talulah.

Talulah:
To my enemies, you have no need for my name.

Talulah:
But my fires will set you alight.
