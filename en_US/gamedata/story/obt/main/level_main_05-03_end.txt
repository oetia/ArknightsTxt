Reunion Member:
Why is everyone running away?!

Reunion Member:
Attack her with Arts! Stop running!!

Reunion Member:
S-stop! She, she's coming this way! Stop her!

Reunion Member:
Where are all the others?! Why...

Hoshiguma:
You're the last one.

Reunion Member:
Aaaaah...!

Reunion Member:
Demon... S-someone save me...

Hoshiguma:
...You planned to stop me like this?

Reunion Member:
No, I... No...

Hoshiguma:
You planned to stop me... like this?

Reunion Member:
Spare me! Please!

Hoshiguma:
You're not even worthy of being food for my Hannya.

Reunion Member:
Noooooo!!

L.G.D. Agent:
Holy... We haven't even launched our attack yet.

L.G.D. Agent:
She destroyed Reunion alone, in just two and a half minutes.

L.G.D. Agent:
She truly is a demon.

Ch'en:
Just be glad that you didn't meet her five years ago. It's been a long time since I last saw her fight like this.

Ch'en:
What about the stragglers?

L.G.D. Agent:
They've already been captured by our various squads.

L.G.D. Agent:
...Madam Ch'en, Inspector Hoshiguma seems to be waving at you.

Ch'en:
Medic, come with me!

Ch'en:
Hoshiguma, what else did you ask those Reunion members?

Hoshiguma:
I asked them if the warehouse was rigged.

Ch'en:
If the entire warehouse is hooked up with explosives...

Hoshiguma:
We'll throw them in, one by one.

Ch'en:
So?

Hoshiguma:
Nothing. Phal made his way here after he was ambushed. Reunion originally was set up around here.

Hoshiguma:
Ch'en, pull on the door's right side. I'll get the left.

Ch'en:
...It seems to be jammed and won't budge. Let me try cutting a hole first.

Hoshiguma:
No need, I'll just tear it apart.

Hoshiguma:
(BOOOOM!)

Ch'en:
It's open!

Ch'en:
XR02, tell me your location! XR02!

Ch'en:
!

Ch'en:
XR02!

Informant:
Madam Ch'en... I hear fighting outside. The warehouse door... was busted open. It might be Reunion. I'll take care of it myself...

Ch'en:
Stop, that's me! Don't hang up!

Informant:
Is that you, Madam Ch'en? That's a relief... I'm... all the way in the back.

Ch'en:
That wound... what happened to your eyes?

Informant:
I wasn't careful enough, got hit by Arts. Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter now. This... *cough*... is for you.

Ch'en:
Medic, staunch his bleeding!

Informant:
No... Madam Ch'en, there's no need. I've already accepted...

Ch'en:
Stop talking!

Informant:
It's true. Do you see how many times I've been shot? I'm blind, and don't want to move anymore. I've had enough of the pain. I'm so tired.

Informant:
Take it, Madam Ch'en... S249TA, F106.

Ch'en:
49. I've memorized the location.

Informant:
Details are on the paper. The intel about Reunion's infiltration was not sent to the other leaders, but just to one party... There must be a reason behind it. You must look into it, the sooner the better.

Ch'en:
I will.

Informant:
*cough*... It was no easy task for me to get this... Anyway, Madam Ch'en, I didn't expect things to end up like this.

Informant:
Even though I was finally able to make a contribution, I didn't think this would be how I did it...

Ch'en:
None of us did. Thanks to your bravery, we now have a chance to stop the enemy.

Informant:
Haha... *cough*... I never liked Lungmen, and Lungmen never liked me.

Informant:
But now, I've finally managed to do something for Lungmen. Not bad for a bum like me, right...

Ch'en:
You're calling one of the Chung Shui Big Three a bum?

Informant:
Compared to you, Madam Oni, I'm nothing more than a bum.

Informant:
...

Informant:
...Madam Ch'en, how's Madam Oni doing? Is she still working as Inspector?

Ch'en:
She is. She's been my partner for a long time.

Informant:
Madam Ch'en, Madam Oni... is too honest and frank. No one in the gang... *cough*... dared to challenge her.

Informant:
But she is no match for those Lungmen moguls. Please keep an eye on her.

Informant:
Don't let anyone demean her. I won't let those stuck-up plutocrats insult her because of her background!

Informant:
This is the only favor I ask of you. Just one... *cough* *cough*...

Ch'en:
Don't worry about that. Hoshiguma is very strong. No one can hurt her.

Informant:
No matter how powerful, everyone has their limits.

Ch'en:
The entire L.G.D. stands with her.

Informant:
Good, that's a relief. Madam Oni, Madam Ch'en, I have no regrets now.

Informant:
Madam Ch'en, are you still here?

Ch'en:
I am.

Informant:
Am I a good person?

Ch'en:
A few years ago, a bit hard to say. But now you are, without a doubt. Lungmen is proud of having citizens like you.

Informant:
Hahaha... *cough*... Haha... a pathetic Infected can be a good citizen?

Ch'en:
Some people in Lungmen are indeed obsessed with Oripathy, but you'd be better off asking Lungmen directly.

Informant:
How do I do that? Will a city answer me?

Ch'en:
Heh. I will, on its behalf.

Ch'en:
And it says, 'I don't mind.'

Ch'en:
Phal, you have always been - and always will be - one of Lungmen's best.

Informant:
Thank you, Madam Ch'en. Thank you so much.

Informant:
Madam Chen, there are two things I'd like you to relay to Madam Oni.

Ch'en:
You should tell her yourself.

Informant:
What do you mean? Are you saying...

Informant:
...Boss?

Hoshiguma:
It's me. I'm right here.

Informant:
Madam Ch'en, you should've told me sooner.

Ch'en:
She chose to not say anything.

Informant:
Boss, did I do a good job?

Hoshiguma:
Not good enough. You can't call it a good job until you survive to see things through.

Informant:
Well damn, haha... I've already used up my luck to have you carry me on your back, Boss.

Hoshiguma:
Anywhere you want to go? You always refused to tell me where you came from.

Informant:
Here, Lungmen. As a matter of fact, I've never been to other cities. If possible, just bury me in that old place.

Hoshiguma:
The hideout? But... that place is a complete wreck now, long deserted. To be honest, I'm not sure how I'd clean it up.

Informant:
It's okay. As long as I'm... with the others.

Hoshiguma:
I will.

Informant:
Boss... Even though we've always been scared of you, we've also always... cheered you on.

Informant:
We've always... cheered...

Hoshiguma:
Same here.
