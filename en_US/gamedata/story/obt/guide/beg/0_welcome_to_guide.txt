Ah, it's you.

It's been a long time since we've last seen each other.

During this time... you've been teetering on the edge of a cliff.

You may have forgotten who you are, but just remembering your name is enough.

...It's time. Don't linger here for too long.

After all, you aren't my guest yet, nor should you even be here.

She still needs you.

December 23rd.

You may not remember what this date means to you.

And this will thrust you into peril.

......

No...

You must try to remember.

Distant Voice:
...consciousness...

Distant Voice:
Circulation resumed... vitals stabilized... cardioplegia solution injected...

Distant Voice:
Body temperature low... administering Hexamethasone 20 c.c., now...

Distant Voice:
Get the hemostat!

Distant Voice:
...Conditions stable... beginning resection... be careful of VFib...

Distant Voice:
...Sorry...

Distant Voice:
For making you suffer again...

???:
......

???:
Doctor...

???:
...hand!

???:
Take my...

???:
Take my hand!!

???:
......

???:
Emergency...

???:
...Help...

???:
...It's done...!

???:
Doctor, Doctor!

???:
Medic, how's Doctor doing?

???:
But, just a moment ago... we were holding hands...

???:
So why... why is Doctor still not waking up...?

Medic:
Amiya! Don't panic, just calm down first!

Amiya:
Ah... S-sorry.

Medic:
You always get so flustered when it comes to the doctor.

Medic:
But, Amiya, if the worst came to pass... what would you do then?

Amiya:
...I'm already mentally prepared for that. We would continue to follow the plan.

Medic:
...I understand. Anyway, I'll do what you requested.

Amiya:
All right... I appreciate it.

Amiya:
About the Doctor...

Medic:
Don't worry, Amiya. All the vital signs are stable now.

Medic:
I'll do one more inspection, just for you.

Amiya:
Thank you... Thank you very much!

Medic:
Mhm. Breathing is slightly shallow, but blood pressure is normal. There should be no cause for concern.

Amiya:
...!

Medic:
...

Medic:
Are you awake?

Medic:
Amiya, it's a success! The Doctor has woken up!

Amiya:
Doctor...?

Amiya:
I'm so happy... Doctor...

Medic:
Ah, careful! You mustn't do that...

Medic:
Don't try to move yet. Your body still hasn't fully adapted to this.

Amiya:
Doctor...?

Amiya:
Ah, Doctor... It's me...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
It's me, Amiya.

Amiya:
We've come to rescue you.

Amiya:
You...

Amiya:
You're a member of Rhodes Island, just like us...

Amiya:
...as well as my partner.

Amiya:
...Dr. {@nickname}.

Amiya:
You're the most important person to me.

Amiya:
Doctor... you don't remember?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
I understand. I know this is a bit much to take in right now.

Amiya:
I don't expect you to remember everything right away, and I'm not asking you to trust me right now.

Amiya:
Dr. {@nickname}, do you really not remember me at all...?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
Even if that's the case... I won't give up.

Amiya:
We've already sacrificed so much, just to find you...

Amiya:
Ah, um, hello.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
I, I don't know how to put this, but so many things have changed from before.

Amiya:
That includes me as well.

Amiya:
However, you'll always be the most important person to me, Doctor. No matter what happens, this will never change.

Amiya:
So that's why, please... give me a little more time.

Amiya:
However little it might be...

Medic:
Does the doctor... really have amnesia?

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
I'm sure everything will be fine if we give Doctor some space...

Amiya:
It's safe here—

Amiya:
Huh? What's happening—

Heavily-Armed Man:
Amiya, we've got a problem!

Heavily-Armed Man:
Someone broke into the facility!

Heavily-Armed Man:
The way they're dressed... they don't look like Ursus soldiers!

Reunion Member:
...

Heavily-Armed Man:
What's the meaning of this?!

Heavily-Armed Man:
They're attacking! Amiya, they're heavily equipped with weapons!

Medic:
Aaaahh!

Amiya:
Be careful, everyone! Take cover, and protect Doctor!

Amiya:
These outfits... are they from the Reunion Movement? But how is that possible...

Amiya:
Guards, prepare for battle!

Guard:
Roger!

Guard:
Curses... Are they after the Doctor?!

Amiya:
No... Nobody else should know about the Doctor being here.

Amiya:
Are you able to reach Kal'tsit?

Guard:
I'm not sure why, but the equipment isn't working!

Amiya:
...Someone has cut off our communications.

Amiya:
Have we been discovered by the Ursus government?

Guard:
What do we do now?

Amiya:
Kal'tsit won't be able to command the battle as we had originally planned.

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
...Dr. {@nickname}.

Amiya:
I hope that... you'll be able to take command.

Medic:
Isn't that a bit too risky? The Doctor only just came to...

Amiya:
I'd like... to give it a try.

Amiya:
Even without memories, Doctor has...

Amiya:
...fought alongside us before.

???:
Thank you for all of your guidance...

Amiya:
...

Amiya:
We've been through so much together...

Amiya:
Doctor... I just know that you'll be able to do it.

???:
I know that you'll lead us to victory.

Amiya:
I understand that asking you to do this is very sudden and inconsiderate.

Amiya:
But... Please, lend us your aid.

Amiya:
We'll be supporting you!

Amiya:
Mm... I don't want to drag you into this.

Amiya:
But right now, we need your wisdom more than ever, Dr. {@nickname}.

Amiya:
I hope that a part of you will reawaken during combat.

Amiya:
Even though you might have doubts about yourself...

Amiya:
But I believe in you.

Amiya:
I know you can do this.

Amiya:
Please take command... of Rhodes Island!
