Guard:
This is the last one!

Reunion Member:
Ugh!

Guard:
Target eliminated. The enemy squad is retreating!

Guard:
Dr. {@nickname}'s commands were perfect, just like Amiya said. How reassuring!

Amiya:
See, that wasn't too bad, right?

Amiya:
Doctor, compared to everything you've been through, this is a walk in the park.

Reunion Member:
*cough*...Why are you here... You're not from Ursus...

Reunion Member:
We won't... let you get in the way of our duties!

???:
Don't even think about it!

Guard:
Instructor!

Dobermann:
What are you spacing out for? You almost got yourself killed!

Guard:
I'm... I'm sorry!

Dobermann:
Quick! Get back into formation!

Guard:
Yessir!

Amiya:
Dobermann! You made it!

Dobermann:
It's an emergency. My team was attacked by Reunion as well.

Dobermann:
I rushed over to join you as soon as I could.

Amiya:
Why would Reunion attack us...?

Dobermann:
An organization made up of the Infected... I've always thought they were a bit extreme...

Dobermann:
...and now they've resorted to violence, and in an Ursus city no less? That's a death wish.

Dobermann:
The situation is only going to get more chaotic from here on out.

Dobermann:
Amiya, we need to leave Chernobog right now.

Amiya:
Okay. We've already rescued the Doctor, so we can retreat according to plan.

Dobermann:
...And this is Dr. {@nickname}?

Amiya:
Yes.

Dobermann:
Dr. {@nickname}, you probably don't know who I am, but you know Amiya. For your safety...

Amiya:
No, no...

Amiya:
Um, Dobermann, Doctor isn't doing very well right now.

Amiya:
To put it simply, Doctor... has amnesia.

Dobermann:
Amnesia?

Dobermann:
...What are you going to do now? Weren't you planning to transfer leadership to—

Amiya:
Doctor still has the capacity to command.

Amiya:
...At least, I've confirmed that from the previous battle.

Dobermann:
...

Dobermann:
I can't bring myself to trust a stranger so easily.

Dobermann:
But I trust you, Amiya.

Amiya:
...I understand.

Dobermann:
Dr. {@nickname}, I am Dobermann, captain of Op Team E1.

Dobermann:
We are going to escort you from Chernobog, which is the Ursus city we're currently in, back to Rhodes Island.

Dobermann:
We're in an abandoned facility in Chernobog and should now head west.

Amiya:
But... since we're cut off from Dr. Kal'tsit, Dobermann and I have lead our separate teams westward to a rendezvous point before confirming our signal to retreat.

Amiya:
That is, assuming everything goes according to plan.

Dobermann:
It'd be nice if things went that smoothly.

Dobermann:
Today is our last opportunity to get you out of here, Dr. {@nickname}.

Dobermann:
But... I have a bad feeling about this.

Medic:
A-Amiya!

Amiya:
What's the matter?

Medic:
It's... it's a call from Rhodes Island!

Amiya:
Are our communications back on? Is it Dr. Kal'tsit...?

???:
Sorry, but not quite.

Amiya:
PRTS...?

PRTS:
The Emergency Neural Connection Request System was activated.

PRTS:
Interference has also been detected from Rhodes Island's end, and only partial Neural Network connection is possible.

PRTS:
Currently unable to establish communication with Kal'tsit, who has yet to return to Rhodes Island.

PRTS:
Your safety is confirmed; therefore, my mission is now complete.

Dobermann:
This piece of...

Dobermann:
Do we really have time for this...?

PRTS:
If you do not need to connect to Rhodes Island, communication will be severed momentarily.

PRTS:
I am sincerely sorry for having interrupted your party.

Amiya:
Wait, wait! Don't hang up, I need your help still.

Amiya:
Dobermann, Doctor still needs some assistance.

Dobermann:
I know, but make it quick.

Amiya:
Doctor, PRTS is also one of our... partners. It will show you what to do next.

Amiya:
Time is of the essence, so I'm going to reconnect you to the Rhodes Island backup system.

Amiya:
This way, we'll have an edge in battle.

Amiya:
It's different from giving verbal commands and might be a bit hard to get used to, but once you learn how to use it, the entire operation will be much smoother.

Amiya:
...Please trust me. Just like how you used to.

Amiya:
PRTS... Let's start.

PRTS:
Identity verification required. Select verification method.

Amiya:
Ah, Doctor... Please say something.

PRTS:
I am not sure why you did not speak, but the action of touching the interface is sufficient—

PRTS:
—Fingerprint match found. Verification complete. Security clearance: 8

PRTS:
Welcome home, Dr. {@nickname}.
