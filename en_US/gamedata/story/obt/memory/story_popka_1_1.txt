Rhodes Island Landship, Common Rest Area Passageway

Popukar:
The end.

Bubble:
That's it?

Bubble:
When's the next episode?

Popukar:
I'll ask.

Popukar:
Shamare, when can we watch 'Felitubbies' episode 20?

Shamare:
Zzzz...

Bubble:
Looks like she fell asleep while we were watching.

Bubble:
She's been doing that a lot.

Bubble:
Isn't 'Felitubbies' fun though?

Popukar:
Spot says it's for kids.

Popukar:
Maybe Shamare got too big for it?

Bubble:
No way!

Bubble:
She's only a few years older than us! Just two episodes ago, she was with us for the whole thing! How could she fall asleep on us this time?!

Popukar:
We'll grow up really, really soon too. Maybe we'll be grown-ups by the time we finish the show.

Popukar:
What do you want to do when you grow up, Bubble?

Bubble:
Me? I'm gonna go back to my tribe and beat up everyone I don't like and become a great warrior!

Bubble:
What 'bout you?

Popukar:
I wanna be a superhero. I'll knock out bad guys with one punch, shoot eye lasers, and fly through the sky.

Bubble:
Do superheroes really exist?

Bubble:
I've never seen anyone shoot beams out their eyes or anyone who knows how to fly.

Bubble:
I know lots who beat up bad guys, though.

Bubble:
Like me.

Popukar:
That's just what I want to become...

Popukar:
My eye has been sick for so long, I've been thinking how cool it would be if I could shoot lasers out of my eyes like a superhero.

Bubble:
I hope you get better! I want to see both your eyes!

Popukar:
When my bad eye gets better, you'll be the first one to see it.

Bubble:
Really?! Hooray!

Popukar:
Hehe.

Popukar:
Hmm...

Popukar:
What time is it?

Popukar:
Hm...

Popukar:
It's 4:30.

Popukar:
Orchid told us we could play for two hours. We only have half an hour left.

Bubble:
Why only two hours? Can't we play all hours?

Popukar:
We have training and school. We need to do our homework, too. The teacher will be mad if we don't.

Bubble:
Why do we have to do homework?

Popukar:
We need to study hard. That's what the adults always tell us.

Bubble:
I've been running all around the ship every day. I've never heard anything about homework.

Bubble:
And um, what is homework actually? Is it tasty?

Popukar:
I don't think you can eat it. Homework's—Hm... I'm not sure what exactly homework is either. I just know you get smarter if you do it.

Popukar:
Why don't you give it a try?

Bubble:
Is this homework?

Popukar:
Yes.

Bubble:
It's just a book.

Bubble:
Did you draw all these things?

Popukar:
Most of them.

Popukar:
But the red ink ones are the teacher.

Bubble:
......

Bubble:
I don't get it at all.

Bubble:
Ugh, you can have it back.

Bubble:
If they make me learn this stuff, I'm gonna jump off the ship and run straight home to Papa in Sargon.

Bubble:
And if anyone stands in my way, I'll trample them!

Popukar:
I heard what happened with that lady from Minos a few days ago—

Bubble:
Nothing happened! You heard wrong!

Bubble:
That Forte's not so strong!

Bubble:
I smashed her into the ground easy!

Popukar:
Uh-huh.

Bubble:
Really! I did!

Popukar:
If you swear on your Papa, I'll believe you.

Bubble:
Ugh...

Bubble:
Fine! I will!

Bubble:
I, Bubble, swear by Papa's name... that I couldn't beat the Minoan Forte lady.

Popukar:
So you lied. It did happen.

Bubble:
Don't tell anyone! I'm really not so weak, really really!

Bubble:
The Forte lady is just way too strong!

Popukar:
Okay, I see. You tell the truth every time you swear.

Bubble:
W-What can I do? Papa said that if you swear something by someone's name, that person'll hear it!

Bubble:
If Papa finds out I lied, he'll whoop my butt so hard!

Popukar:
So if I swear something by my dad's name, will he hear what I say too?

Bubble:
I dunno. Why don't you try?

Popukar:
My dad. His name—

Popukar:
Hmm...

Popukar:
I don't remember his name.

Bubble:
What about your mama? That works too.

Popukar:
I don't remember hers either.

Popukar:
Auntie Kal'tsit said I was sculpted out of clay.

Popukar:
But I think I had parents too.

Popukar:
Everyone else has parents. There's no way I don't.

Bubble:
You're right.

Bubble:
Maybe the white coat doctor was lying to you?

Popukar:
I don't think Auntie Kal'tsit lies.

Bubble:
The Feline doctor, right? I can tell from the look on her face, she's a bad woman. Not like my shaman grandpa back home. He's always smiling. One look at him and you know he's nice.

Popukar:
Being quiet doesn't make someone a baddie.

Popukar:
Look at Shamare.

Popukar:
Shamare always looks really cold too, but she takes care of everyone.

Popukar:
That one time you ate a cactus and got needles all stuck in your mouth, she was the one who knocked you out cold and plucked out every last one before she turned you over to the doctors.

Bubble:
Oh...

Popukar:
And she knows how to pick good apples. Her apples are so big, sweet, and tasty.

Bubble:
You're right. She does bring us really tasty apples.

Bubble:
Okay, I believe you. Shamare's not a baddie, and that doctor isn't a baddie either.

Bubble:
But if no one's bad, and the doctor didn't lie to you, then how come you don't remember your mama or your papa?

Popukar:
Maybe it's because I have a bad memory. I forget lots of things.

Popukar:
But there are things I won't forget.

Popukar:
The banging sounds in the mines, the big steel cities, way bigger than Rhodes Island, and the towers surrounded by tons of people.

Popukar:
There was a doctor wearing a big white coat, a bunch of glittering chunks of steel, and a small, quiet room.

Popukar:
There was also a big white room with a bed inside.

Bubble:
Sounds like you remember a lot, actually.

Popukar:
But I don't remember my mom and dad's names...

Popukar:
Hm...

Bubble:
Maybe you'll remember when you get your head knocked around. That's how I usually remember things.

Bubble:
I can give you a good whack, if you want!

Bubble:
I'm really strong!

Bubble:
Whap whap whap!

Popukar:
You're too strong, Bubble. You'll smack me so hard I'll turn dumb.

Bubble:
Really? I guess I won't do that then.

Buzz, buzz.

Shamare:
Hmm...

Bubble:
This is boring. Look, Shamare's even talking in her sleep. Popukar, lemme play with your brum brum brrrrr thing a little.

Popukar:
Okay, but the brum brum brrrr thing won't go brrrr today.

Bubble:
Why?

Popukar:
The thing that makes it go brrrr is being fixed.

Popukar:
It broke when I was helping everyone else brrrr things.

Bubble:
Oh.

Bubble:
I'll think of something else to play, then.

Bubble:
You should spend less time on training and classes and play more like me, Popukar. That other stuff is boring.

Popukar:
But if we don't keep up with our training, we might get hurt when we go beat up the baddies.

Popukar:
Besides, I need to help out Orchid, and everyone else.

Bubble:
You're such a goody two-shoes! You should be like me. Grab a shield and charge straight ahead.

Popukar:
That's a good way to get hurt.

Popukar:
When I started out, I didn't know what I was doing. I took my brum brum brrrr thing and swung it all over the place, and it got people hurt sometimes, people I didn't wanna hurt.

Popukar:
Then I started training and I learned to listen to Orchid. She does the thinking, and I do the listening.

Popukar:
That way I won't get hurt, and neither does anybody else. I think it's a nice thing.

Bubble:
The people you don't wanna hurt, are they strong? Like, as strong as Papa?

Popukar:
I don't think so, but they take good care of me.

Popukar:
Orchid combs my hair, and Midnight picks out clothes for me.

Popukar:
Catapult brings me tasty food, and Spot finds me fun comics to read.

Bubble:
Wow—That does sound nice! I should get the Doctor to find me some servants too.

Bubble:
But how come you still chase them with your brum brum brrrr thing?

Popukar:
Brum brum brrrr thing? Chase who?

Popukar:
I wouldn't do that.

Bubble:
Shamare always says she's a big girl and so nobody's allowed to pat her head.

Bubble:
But she actually gets all happy whenever she gets a headpat.

Bubble:
Shamare does?

Bubble:
Yep!

Bubble:
Oh, I have an idea! Shamare's tail is so much fun to play with. Wanna try?

Bubble:
It's so smooth and soft. Not even the beast hide on Papa's throne is that smooth.

Popukar:
Shamare will get mad.

Bubble:
She's asleep! She doesn't have to know!

Popukar:
But what if she wakes up?

Bubble:
Hrmph.

Bubble:
Let me think of something else...

Bubble:
We could wrestle?

Popukar:
Orchid says we're not allowed to wrestle in the lounge. She says it could disturb someone's rest.

Bubble:
You listen to everything she says? Sheesh...

Shamare:
I'll keep an eye... on her...

Shamare:
......

Bubble:
Poor Shamare. So bored she's talking in her sleep.

Bubble:
There's gotta be something fun we can do...?

Bubble:
......

Bubble:
I got it!

Bubble:
Let's arm wrestle! That's safe enough, right?

Bubble:
It's quiet, we get to see which one of us's stronger, and most importantly—

Bubble:
We've never done it before.

Popukar:
I guess.

Bubble:
Let's use this table, then. Come!

Bubble:
Ready?

Popukar:
Yeah.

Bubble:
3!

Popukar:
2!

Popukar & Bubble:
1!

Bubble:
Hmph!

Popukar:
Ahh!

Shamare:
......

Bubble:
I've never lost an arm wrestling match...

Popukar:
Hnggh! Haah!

Bubble:
By Papa's name!

Bubble:
I will never lose at arm wrestling!

Bubble:
Haah!

Popukar:
Hyah!

Popukar:
W-We broke the table...

Bubble:
......

Popukar:
(Whispers) W-What do we do?

Bubble:
(Whispers) I dunno!

Shamare:
Zzzz...

Bubble:
That was close. But she's still asleep.

Bubble:
If we woke her up, she'd curse me for sure.

Popukar:
W-What about the table?

Bubble:
Let the janitor take care of it!

Popukar:
But what if the janitor asks? W-What do we tell him?

Bubble:
We'll tell him it broke on its own!

Popukar:
It's not good to lie...

Bubble:
I don't want a spanking!

Bubble:
Spankings are worse than lying!

Popukar:
*Whimpers*...

Bubble:
Okay, when the adults show up, we'll tell them the table broke on its own. Okay?!

Popukar:
Okay...

Bubble:
Hm, your eyepatch's tilted.

Bubble:
There's something black inside...

Popukar:
(Readjusts eyepatch hurriedly)

Bubble:
Is that black thing those bad rocks?

Popukar:
Maybe. I didn't touch it.

Popukar:
Orchid and Auntie Kal'tsit told me to never take my eyepatch off.

Bubble:
Why?

Popukar:
I don't remember...

Bubble:
Then let me take a look, okay? Just a peek. You can put it right back. It'll be fine.

Popukar:
Hm...

Bubble:
I'll share my snacks with you. I got a really tasty box from the fat purple Vulpo girl last week.

Bubble:
And it's your favorite wafers!

Bubble:
Deal?

Popukar:
Okay...

Popukar:
Just a peek, though.

Bubble:
Okay!

Bubble:
Hehe!

Popukar:
Mmm...

Bubble:
What's wrong?

Popukar:
I-It's too bright...

Bubble:
Hold on! I'll turn off the lights!

Shamare:
(Opens eyes)...

Bubble:
Is it okay now?

Popukar:
Hmm...

Popukar:
(Takes off eyepatch)

Bubble:
Whoa, that's so cool!

Popukar:
Really?

Bubble:
It looks so nice, so cool!

Popukar:
What is it like?

Bubble:
I dunno, but it's super cool.

Bubble:
Hm? Something looks kinda shiny inside.

Popukar:
Oh—

Bubble:
Whoa, it's getting shinier!

Bubble:
Your eye's so awesome!

Popukar:
......

Bubble:
It's kinda hot too.

Popukar:
......!

Popukar:
What's going on?

Bubble:
?

Shamare:
Put your eyepatch on.

Popukar:
Okay, Shamare.

Bubble:
Hey, Shamare, what are you—

Popukar:
Eh?

Shamare:
Orchid's outside the door. Don't keep her waiting.

Popukar:
Orchid? Already? I gotta go!

Popukar:
But what about Bubble?

Shamare:
I'll take her back to the dorm.

Popukar:
Okay.

Popukar:
Then I'll get going. See you!

Shamare:
See ya.

Shamare:
Phew...

Buzz, buzz.

Shamare:
Yes.

Shamare:
Popukar is fine.

Shamare:
Yes.

Shamare:
I'll bring Bubble right now.

Shamare:
Let's go, Morte. We're dragging Bubble to Medical.

Shamare:
I hope she learned her lesson this time.

Morte:
?

Shamare:
Yes, drag. She's too heavy. We can't carry her.

Shamare:
Let's go.
