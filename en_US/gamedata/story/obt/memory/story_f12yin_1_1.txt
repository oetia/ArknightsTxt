Guard Operator A:
Mountain, some of the bounty hunters went your way! Quite a few of them, too!

Mountain:
Don't worry. I can handle this much.

Bounty Hunter:
Hmph, where did these guys come from? Rhodes Island, remember this! I'll be back for you, you motherf...

Mountain:
Unfortunately, this is as far as you go.

Bounty Hunter:
Don't you think you can take us all down just because you're big!

Bounty Hunter:
Lads, let's go!

Mountain:
Hmph.

Guard Operator A:
Looks like there are quite a few bounty hunters over there. Let's go back Mountain up.

Guard Operator B:
Eh, sure, but I'm not too worried about him.

Guard Operator B:
I doubt these guys are any match for Mountain.

Guard Operator A:
Huh, you think so? I mean, he looks pretty tough, but he's always so polite. He just doesn't seem like that kind of guy.

Guard Operator B:
This is your first time on a mission with him, huh?

Guard Operator B:
That's what I used to think too. I thought maybe he just looked strong.

Guard Operator B:
But it didn't take long for me to realize I got the wrong idea about him. This new guy's something else.

Guard Operator B:
I mean...

Guard Operator A:
Mean what?

Mountain:
*Howls*!!!

Guard Operator B:
Yeah...

Guard Operator A:
What was that?

Guard Operator B:
We'll talk about this later. Let's go around to his twelve and see if we can catch a few guys that slipped past him.

Bounty Hunter:
What a... monster...

Mountain:
I'm nothing compared to others.

Mountain:
Phew...

Mountain:
I suppose trying to take on this many without help is pushing myself a little too far.

Guard Operator B:
Mountain, we caught a few of these shitheads that got away.

Mountain:
Much appreciated.

Guard Operator A:
Whoa, look at them, all beaten to a pulp. Now I feel sorry for them...

Guard Operator A:
And look at this tree, ripped apart right down the middle. Now I see why you said I shouldn't have worried.

Guard Operator B:
Right?

Mountain:
My apologies. I'm not very accustomed to team operations yet. I should've contacted you to come assist me.

Guard Operator B:
Oh, no harm done. You handled yourself pretty well.

Mountain:
I wouldn't say that. Our mission objective is to stop the bounty hunters from being a nuisance to the nearby villages. Had any one of them managed to escape, we would not have solved the issue at hand.

Mountain:
If it wasn't for you two, our mission would have been a failure.

Guard Operator A:
Well, look at you. What a diligent fella.

Mountain:
I hope that isn't a problem.

Guard Operator B:
No, far from it. It's been a long time since we've had a new guy as diligent as you.

Guard Operator B:
Enough about that. Are you okay?

Mountain:
I'm fine. Only a few scratches here and there. They'll heal up in no time.

Guard Operator B:
I'm not talking about your scratches. I'm talking about your digs.

Mountain:
My clothes?

Guard Operator A:
Mountain, your outfit is all burned up. You're basically naked right now.

Mountain:
Oh, uh, my apologies. This is quite embarrassing.

Mountain:
I tend to lose sight of these issues while I'm in a fight.

Guard Operator B:
Haha, no worries. The exact same thing happened last time, though. Are you sure you don't want a different uniform just for field ops?

Guard Operator B:
It's a waste to have to keep replacing a formal getup like that after every mission.

Mountain:
I'm used to dressing formally. You have a point, however. I will consider it.

Logistics Operator:
You want formal clothing that's suitable for combat... am I correct?

Mountain:
Yes, and naturally, if this is too unreasonable of a request, please don't trouble yourself.

Logistics Operator:
Hmm... First, I'm sure someone has already told you, but your uniforms need a special application.

Mountain:
Right. My Logistics operator told me that because there is no standard uniform suitable for my size, I'll need to apply for one.

Mountain:
At the time, I did not expect that I'd find myself in so many battles as an operator here, which is why I've never applied.

Logistics Operator:
And your outfit's been getting torn into shreds after just a few missions.

Mountain:
Right.

Logistics Operator:
Doesn't it get expensive when you need to keep paying for those fancy outfits?

Mountain:
To tell you the truth, I spent most of my first month's salary buying myself new clothes.

Logistics Operator:
Huh? No way!

Mountain:
I'd just broken out of... Ahem, just left home. The equipment that Rhodes Island provides is more than adequate. There's not much I have to buy at my own expense, so this isn't a huge problem.

Mountain:
Nonetheless, I can imagine it turning into one sooner or later.

Logistics Operator:
I guess you could probably just wear something else in combat... and that would solve most of the problem?

Mountain:
Indeed, and as I've already mentioned, I'm not actually adamant about wearing this.

Mountain:
However, I am rather fond of this style of attire. I've also noticed that the operators get rather personalized with the way they are dressed, so I thought I would ask if it would be possible.

Mountain:
If it isn't, then I will apply for a more durable combat uniform.

Logistics Operator:
Hmm... Well, we don't get requests like this that often.

Logistics Operator:
Our operators may have pretty unique wardrobes, but their outfits don't get in the way most of the time.

Mountain:
In that case, forget I asked.

Logistics Operator:
Wait, I'm not done yet! I said we don't get these requests often, but I never said I'm turning you down.

Mountain:
Hm?

Logistics Operator:
We need to put together a new outfit for you anyway. It'll take just a bit more work. It's okay.

Logistics Operator:
Oh, right. This is perfect.

Logistics Operator:
Orchid?

Orchid:
What now? I'm busy here. If you want to have tea, try somebody else.

Logistics Operator:
Oh, that isn't what this is about, Orchid. Actually...

Orchid:
......

Logistics Operator:
Please, Orchid?

Orchid:
This is giving me a headache already.

Logistics Operator:
Oh, don't be like that. Look, you're always complaining about how boring it is to work in Logistics. This might just be a lot more fun than sitting in an office.

Orchid:
I basically run this place by myself. I'm exhausted.

Logistics Operator:
There's a bonus in it.

Orchid:
No kidding?

Logistics Operator:
Of course. You'll be helping solve our operators' problems.

Orchid:
That's a fairly nice motivator, and it almost worked, but I'm at most a designer, not a seamstress. If you need someone to work on clothes, I'm not the right person to ask.

Logistics Operator:
Eh...

Orchid:
Hah... Fine, it just so happens I know who to ask.

Orchid:
Your codename is Mountain, correct?

Mountain:
Yes, ma'am.

Orchid:
Ma'am... No need for that. My codename is Orchid, and it'll do fine. Come with me.

Logistics Operator:
Thank you very much, Orchid.

Orchid:
Be sure to save a slice of cake for me this afternoon.

Logistics Operator:
Okay!

Mountain:
Orchid.

Orchid:
Hm?

Mountain:
About that conversation, is there a dedicated dressmaker at Rhodes Island?

Orchid:
No, I'm taking you to another operator here. She moonlights as a dressmaker.

Mountain:
Is that allowed?

Orchid:
What do you mean?

Mountain:
From my time here, I've always thought of Rhodes Island as something like a PMC.

Mountain:
I've never heard of a part-time dressmaker in these organizations.

Orchid:
You haven't spent much time at Rhodes Island yet, then.

Mountain:
What do you mean?

Orchid:
You have a grave misunderstanding about us here.

Orchid:
......

Orchid:
Okay, maybe it isn't really a misunderstanding. When I first came onboard, I felt more or less the same.

Mountain:
Care to elaborate?

Orchid:
The way you talk grates on my nerves just as much as Midnight, only in a different way...

Orchid:
Well, I could tell you, but you will know what I mean in a minute.

Bibeak:
Oh, good afternoon, Orchid.

Orchid:
Yes, hello.

Bibeak:
May I ask who this is...?

Mountain:
I'm a new operator here, codename Mountain.

Bibeak:
Oh, nice to meet you. I'm codename Bibeak.

Orchid:
Do you have any missions today?

Bibeak:
Yes, but it isn't for another two hours.

Bibeak:
Um, did you need me for something?

Orchid:
Two hours are plenty. Here's the thing...

Bibeak:
Oh, I see. So Mountain wants formalwear that he can fight in!

Mountain:
If it's too much to ask for...

Bibeak:
Not at all!

Bibeak:
Actually, please let me work on it!

Bibeak:
I need only to use fabrics suitable for combat... No, that isn't quite right. That would affect the beauty of the end product...

Orchid:
Bibeak, let's not stand here and talk about that. Give it a try.

Bibeak:
Oh, yes!

Bibeak:
I'm sorry. I haven't tried something like this before. It might take a while.

Mountain:
Not a problem. If this will lead somewhere, I am willing to give it some time.

Bibeak:
Then please come with me.

Bibeak:
What about you, Orchid? Will you come?

Orchid:
I still have a pile of documents to finish... as well as my cake... though I guess I could stay to take a look at the design.

Orchid:
I'm pretty curious how this outfit will turn out myself.

Bibeak:
Is there something that makes you so insistent on wearing such formal attire?

Mountain:
No, I wouldn't say that.

Mountain:
Ever since I was a child, my father has made me dress in this particular manner, and I grew accustomed to it after a while.

Mountain:
Besides...

Bibeak:
Oh, if you'd rather not talk about that, you don't have to. I'm just being curious.

Mountain:
No, not at all. I'm merely wondering whether I truly want to myself.

Mountain:
I've lived far away from my family for a very long period of time.

Mountain:
During that time, life has been... hard to say the least. I never had the opportunity to wear anything like this.

Mountain:
When I was finally able to leave that place behind and come to Rhodes Island, I bought myself a set of formalwear.

Mountain:
I can't say for certain whether this is partly because I miss my family... my parents.

Bibeak:
I see... so you still can't see your parents, even now?

Mountain:
That's correct. One of the reasons I came to Rhodes Island is because I hope to be able to see them one day.

Mountain:
At the beginning of those difficult times, I very much missed my parents.

Mountain:
But as time went on, I also grew accustomed to life without them.

Mountain:
That is why I'm not certain whether this attire is something I choose to wear because I'm used to it or because I want it to serve as a reminder.

Orchid:
Why not both? That doesn't seem too odd.

Mountain:
You're right...

Mountain:
Speaking of which, are you a dressmaker, Bibeak?

Bibeak:
Oh, I'm not. I just like to do some sewing on my off time.

Bibeak:
It's been a while since I joined Rhodes Island, and many of our operators know about this hobby of mine, so they sometimes come to me for this.

Mountain:
And, Orchid, you mentioned being a designer yourself?

Orchid:
That's right. I used to be an editor at a fashion magazine.

Orchid:
Most of Rhodes Island's uniforms are mass-produced, but many of the folks here have got interesting personalities and want something different.

Orchid:
And that's when Bibeak and I shine.

Orchid:
*Sigh*... I used to do this pretty willingly, but, as time went on, I started to feel like we could just keep everyone in their uniforms if they all have to come to me with their weird requests.

Orchid:
Compared to all the other ones, this request is probably on the normal side.

Bibeak:
But isn't it really fun to make clothes for others? Some of our requests may be a little weird, but it's actually pretty fun to make those designs come true.

Orchid:
Oh, my sweet child. Most everyone who says that ends up working themselves dead. Don't be so tolerant of others.

Bibeak:
I think you're pretty tolerant of everyone in A6, though...

The moment she hears that, Orchid rolls her eyes.

Mountain:
......

Orchid:
You've been pretty quiet. Something the matter?

Mountain:
No. It's just your conversation has left me feeling like I'm taking a stroll down some busy street.

Orchid:
I'm thinking of introducing you to a certain Midnight later.

Mountain:
Is that an operator?

Orchid:
He is, and I'm looking forward to the conversations you two will have with each other.

Bibeak:
Oh, there we go.

Mountain:
Is this... a storeroom?

Bibeak:
Yes, this place is normally a storeroom, but I also use it to sew.

Bibeak:
Now, Mountain, I'd like to take your measurements, if that is okay with you.

Mountain:
Okay.

Bibeak:
Right, and that takes care of it.

Bibeak:
By the way, do you have any preferences about your outfit's design?

Mountain:
Not at all. Something like what I'm wearing will do.

Bibeak:
What about the color?

Mountain:
White will do.

Bibeak:
Okay, then. Just leave the rest to me.

Bibeak:
I'll come get you once it's ready.

Mountain:
Is that it?

Orchid:
Yes.

Bibeak:
Even though you don't have any specific needs, we should probably work on a new design.

Bibeak:
Oh, maybe I could modify the design I worked on last month!

Orchid:
The one you showed me?

Bibeak:
Right.

Orchid:
Nothing wrong with that design, but I'm afraid it's far too refined for Mountain.

Bibeak:
Hmm... You're right.

Orchid:
We're not in a rush with either designing or making the outfit, and the choice of the fabric is what's important.

Orchid:
I'll ask the Logistics operators in charge of uniforms. I'm sure they know what kind of fabrics are the right choice for combat suits.

Bibeak:
I'll come with you.

Bibeak:
Formalwear needs to be pleasing to the eye. I'm not sure the fabrics they normally use for combat uniforms are good enough aesthetically.

Orchid:
Well, I don't mind a little company, but isn't it about time for your mission?

Bibeak:
Oh, shoot! I almost forgot!

Bibeak:
I'm very sorry. Is it okay if we go together after I come back?

Orchid:
Of course, but you should report in for your mission.

Bibeak:
Right!

Orchid:
Well, you heard her. Go home and wait. If Logistics get their hands on the right fabric, we should have something for you in a week.

Mountain:
Very well...

One week later...

Bibeak:
Mountain, are you done yet?

Mountain:
One more second.

Mountain:
Here we go.

Bibeak:
How does it feel?

Mountain:
Very comfortable.

Mountain:
I like the design, and the fabrics you used are very sturdy.

Mountain:
Much appreciated.

Bibeak:
No, I should thank you.

Bibeak:
The choice of fabric actually bothered me for a long time. I couldn't find anything that I'm satisfied with.

Bibeak:
But then I remembered some of the fabrics that my father used when he worked on his industrial outfits.

Bibeak:
I never thought of using those in my outfit designs, but I took the chance to give it a try, and it worked surprisingly well.

Bibeak:
This has been an eye-opening experience.

Mountain:
I see. That's good to hear.

Orchid:
I suppose designers normally don't use industrial materials for their work... though Rhodes Island is not the place for common sense.

Bibeak:
Well, then, I still have a mission, so please excuse me now.

Bibeak:
If there are any problems with your outfit, feel free to come to me any time.

Mountain:
Of course.

Mountain:
......

Orchid:
Why are you standing there like an idiot?

Mountain:
No reason... It's just that when I see the two of you... it feels like I haven't fully grasped that I am free.

Mountain:
Thank you very much, Orchid.

Orchid:
No need to thank me for your uniform. I did what anyone should've done.

Mountain:
No, that's only part of it. You made me realize a few of the problems I still have.

Orchid:
I really wish it was Catapult or Midnight saying this to me instead of you.

Mountain:
I beg your pardon?

Orchid:
Nothing, just talking to myself. I don't know what you've been through, nor do I know what you came to Rhodes Island for.

Orchid:
There this one thing that a certain frivolous host asked me before. Maybe I should ask you the same question.

Mountain:
Please.

Orchid:
He asked me, 'What kind of life do you want to lead at Rhodes Island?'

Mountain:
......

Orchid:
Feel free to come to me if you need anything clothing-related.

Orchid:
Or rather, don't come to me. I'm a very busy woman. Try Bibeak if you need anything.

Mountain:
Okay.

Mountain:
Well... Perhaps I should really give some thought about my life here again.
