A certain village in northern Leithanien

Feeble Child:
*cough*, *cough*...

Anxious Mother:
Oh, what should we do? Luca is in so much pain!

Feeble Child:
Mama, it hurts... It hurts... My leg... My leg feels like it's on fire.

Helpless Father:
Shh, Luca. Bear with it, and keep your voice down. Thomas next door will hear you.

Helpless Father:
You're a strong boy. One of the strongest there is! If you can't bear it, just bite the pillow.

Anxious Mother:
He's almost chewed the cotton down to shreds! Look at how much he's sweating! He has a fever, too. We... we should take him to Dr. Marcos!

Helpless Father:
No, we can't!

Helpless Father:
Look. Look at his leg... This black lump.

Anxious Mother:
It's Oripathy...

Helpless Father:
Shh, don't say it out loud. We need to keep this from Luca.

Helpless Father:
You know what happened to Ben over at the Janiks. His arms had these lumps, and they took him away. His family hasn't seen him since.

Anxious Mother:
*sob*... Luca... Don't let them take my Luca.

Helpless Father:
This is how it is... We have to... endure and ride it out.

Feeble Child:
Mama... Mamaaa...

Helpless Father:
Here, bite Papa's hand, Luca. Hang in there... You're a big boy. You'll get better.

Helpless Father:
A miracle will happen... A miracle will heal you up.

Helpless Father:
We need to have faith.

???:
Hello, is anybody home?

Anxious Mother:
Someone's knocking on our door! They must be here to take Luca away!

Helpless Father:
Calm down. I'll take a look through the window. You and Luca stay in here. Don't come out.

Nearl:
Hello, sir.

Helpless Father:
A Kuranta? Dressed up like a knight too. Not something we see in our small village every day.

Nearl:
Sir, please relax. We're just a few wandering doctors passing through. If it's not too much to ask, could you bring us some water?

Helpless Father:
Water... Right, okay... If you're willing to drink the water here, I won't turn you away.

Helpless Father:
Here, you go. Leave as soon as you are finished. Take the cup with you.

Nightingale:
......

Nearl:
What's wrong, Liz? The water seems fine to me.

Nightingale:
I can feel it... That silent, voiceless pain... It's right here.

Shining:
Right. It's weak, but still clear as day.

Shining:
Someone's screaming for help.

Nearl:
If that's what you two say—

Nearl:
Sir... Does someone in your family have Oripathy?

Helpless Father:
Oripathy?! H-How dare you!

Nightingale:
He's in pain, isn't he? But he hasn't given up hope.

Nightingale:
I can... heal him.

Helpless Father:
You... Those horns... That shape! You, and you! You are devils!

Nearl:
Mister, please calm down. Just as I mentioned, we are doctors. If anyone is infected with Oripathy here, we can help alleviate their symptoms, and you don't need to give us anything in return.

Helpless Father:
I told you—No one's sick here, and we definitely don't need any treatment!

Helpless Father:
Now leave, Kuranta! You're full of lies! And you, devils, stay far away from my house!

Nearl:
Looks like he made his decision. He doesn't want us to treat his family.

Shining:
It happens fairly often.

Shining:
Normally, a doctor needs to earn her patient's trust, and he doesn't trust us.

Nearl:
He seems nervous. It might be our race or status that's agitated him.

Shining:
If Nearl has to wave the white flag, famous and popular as she is, then Liz and I don't stand a chance. Sarkaz don't have a good reputation here.

Nearl:
We could try persuading him. We've done that many times before.

Shining:
We can, as long as we don't end up coming across any Gendarmerie.

Nearl:
Right. It's much easier to convince a patient's family than an entire squad of Gendarmerie.

Shining:
We need to avoid that kind of 'persuasion.'

Nearl:
Yeah, Liz hasn't been doing very well lately... I agree. We shouldn't take any risks.

Nearl:
Unfortunately, if this drags on much longer, the patient's condition will deteriorate.

Nightingale:
Feels bad...

Nearl:
Liz, are you okay? Are you feeling sick?

Nightingale:
That boy... He's having a really bad time... He's locked in that small room while his Oripathy torments him.

Nearl:
Liz is right. The kid is locked away. They're even stifling his screams.

Nearl:
Are they torturing an Infected?

Nightingale:
No, not at all. The father... He didn't show any hatred on his face when he mentioned Oripathy.

Nightingale:
There is hatred everywhere else.

Nearl:
Is he protecting the patient, then?

Nearl:
I heard the Leithanians take the Infected away from their families, round them up to live in ghettoes.

Nearl:
If the patient is his child, I suppose he might be trying to hide his Infection, to keep the Gendarmerie from taking his boy away.

Nightingale:
He may care for his child, but that's slowly taking his child's life.

Nightingale:
He is losing his chance to live, and his energy is slowly draining away in this cage of love.

Nightingale:
Hmm...

Nearl:
Liz!

Shining:
Don't think about that... It'll only worsen your condition if you let that sadness get to you.

Shining:
We've walked a very long distance today. I can tell you are exhausted. You need rest.

Nearl:
Does it feel better when you lean against me? The tent will be ready soon.

Shining:
Let's start a fire and get you something to eat.

Shining:
It's getting dark. The Leithanian Gendarmerie moves quickly, and they might be here by tomorrow. We should leave this place before do, if we want to stay out of trouble.

Nearl:
Right, it's not a good idea to show ourselves to the Gendarmerie.

Nearl:
Liz, lie down here, closer to the fire. It'll warm you up.

Nightingale:
Yeah.

Shining:
You two should get some rest. I'll stand watch.

Shining:
It's the Gendarmerie. They're here.

Nearl:
Shining, are you awake already? You went to bed not that long ago.

Shining:
I got enough sleep. We need to leave right now. Liz, can you walk?

Nightingale:
Yeah, I can.

Nightingale:
Ughh...

Shining:
You look really pale. Did you get enough rest?

Nightingale:
I... I'm okay. I just feel a little dizzy.

Nearl:
The Gendarmerie went straight to the house we visited last night. Shining, should we really just leave like this?

Shining:
There's a good hiding spot behind the bushes.

Shining:
They won't spot us there.

Shining:
Nearl, hold Liz. If it looks like things are getting out of hand, do as you see fit.

Leithanian Gendarmerie:
Mr. Reiss! Please open the door!

Helpless Father:
I...

Leithanian Gendarmerie:
Mr. Reiss!

Nervous Neighbor:
Officer, look! I told you something's not right with Old Reiss's family!

Nervous Neighbor:
His boy—his name is Luca—he was playing in the fields a few days ago, and he suddenly got sick after he came back.

Nervous Neighbor:
For the few days after that, his family kept themselves locked inside, and they wouldn't come out, no matter what!

Helpless Father:
I-I'm just taking care of Luca...

Nervous Neighbor:
How am I supposed to believe you?! What kind of disease would keep a strong kid like him bedridden for days on end?

Nervous Neighbor:
Besides, if your kid really caught a cold, you could've taken him to Dr. Marcos!

Leithanian Gendarmerie:
Something sounds fishy here.

Nervous Neighbor:
Right, officer? I am doing this for everyone's safety!

Nervous Neighbor:
This is a peaceful, quiet village. We can't let Oripathy ruin our lives here!

Leithanian Gendarmerie:
Right, all Infected must be quarantined at a nearby quarantine zone.

Nervous Neighbor:
Right? Reiss, did you hear that? Your boy's just going to the quarantine zone! Luca will be in good hands there! Much better than keeping him here!

Helpless Father:
But...

Leithanian Gendarmerie:
But what, Mr. Reiss? You will need to open this door today.

Lively Child:
Yeah, Papa, open the door.

Lively Child:
I'm starving. I want bread. And not just one slice. I can eat five or six slices in one go.

Nervous Neighbor:
Huh—Huh?!

Lively Child:
Oh, Uncle Thomas. Sorry for bumping into you. I'm in a rush to get home for breakfast so Mama doesn't give me a scolding.

Helpless Father:
Oh, Luca, you're home at last. What took you so long?

Helpless Father:
I'm very sorry, Officer. This is my boy, Luca. It's not that I didn't want to open up. He really wasn't home.

Leithanian Gendarmerie:
This boy is Luca? He looks as fit as a fiddle. Is he really sick?

Helpless Father:
*cough*, just a little cold. You know boys his age. They get sick after a day of fun and games.

Leithanian Gendarmerie:
I suppose so. I've met plenty of Infected. None of them are nearly as lively. Dr. Marcos, what do you think?

Elderly Doctor:
Oh... Oh? You want me to check him? Let me take a look.

Elderly Doctor:
Look at how muscular and sweaty his arms are. So sturdy to the feel.

Elderly Doctor:
And his legs...

Helpless Father:
*Cough*

Elderly Doctor:
My, what strong legs. There's so much mud. Looks like this boy has been having fun.

Nervous Neighbor:
......

Helpless Father:
Sorry for all the trouble, Dr. Marcos.

Elderly Doctor:
Oh, no need to worry! Officer, we've been working all morning. I'm as famished as one can be, My vision is starting to blur.

Elderly Doctor:
Perhaps we should let the boy go home for his breakfast?

Elderly Doctor:
Don't worry, if little Luca gets sick again, I will check on him, and if anything's amiss, I will let you know right away.

Helpless Father:
Phew... Thank goodness.

Helpless Father:
Luca, my boy! Let Papa look at you!

Helpless Father:
You're... fine? You can run all over the place, and you can eat...

Helpless Father:
These crystals... They are still here, but they're much smaller now. Not nearly as swollen anymore. You've gotten much better. No wonder Dr. Marcos didn't notice.

Helpless Father:
I-Is this a miracle?

Lively Child:
Papa, it isn't a miracle. A fowlbeast healed me!

Helpless Father:
A fowlbeast...?

Lively Child:
It was a really, really pretty fowlbeast! Its feathers were so much bluer than the water in the lake! I've never seen a little fowlbeast so beautiful!

Lively Child:
Last night, it flew into my room through the window, and settled by my pillow.

Lively Child:
There was a white light around the tiny fowlbeast. It was so bright and warm...

Lively Child:
It came over me, and I stopped hurting right away.

Helpless Father:
A small fowlbeast? And one that glowed?

Lively Child:
Yeah! I'm not lying!

Helpless Father:
My boy, you were ill. You were probably hallucinating.

Lively Child:
It wasn't! It sang a song too! I heard it! The blue fowlbeast sang a song for me!

Helpless Father:
Okay, okay. Everything's fine now. It's all okay...

Helpless Father:
Thank you, blue, magical fowlbeast. I have no idea if you were real or not—you definitely weren't—but whichever the case, thank you for giving Luca a pleasant dream.

Shining:
......

Shining:
We should get going.

Nightingale:
You aren't mad, are you...?

Shining:
Why would I be mad about a little blue bird checking on a sickly boy at night?

Nightingale:
I...

Shining:
Oh, right, the bird was glowing in the dark, too.

Nearl:
*cough*, *cough*.

Nearl:
Sorry, Shining, Liz just couldn't fall asleep last night, so I...

Nightingale:
Shining, I was the one who asked Nearl to help me treat the boy.

Nightingale:
I couldn't fall asleep otherwise... I could hear the boy's pained cries in my head.

Nightingale:
If it wasn't for my legs... if they had some strength left in them... I would've gone myself.

Nightingale:
Please don't blame Nearl.

Shining:
You don't have to apologize. We are doctors. You two did what you should've done.

Nearl:
I didn't expect the Gendarmerie to show up today, though... I wonder what will happen to the boy and his family in the future.

Shining:
They may get to live out the rest of their lives in peace, or they might have to move in the not-so-distant future.

Shining:
As doctors, we may be able to treat our patients' pain, but we don't have any way to treat their predicaments.

Nightingale:
I know that, Shining, but I couldn't spend so much time thinking about it.

Nightingale:
The boy... was really hurting all over.

Nightingale:
When I looked at him, I felt the same pain myself.

Nightingale:
All I knew how to do was... help him hurt less.

Nightingale:
I wanted to help him... to ease his pain... I wanted to help him leave that room... to help him run and jump again.

Shining:
Liz, I just have one question. Look at me and answer me. Do you think this is really necessary?

Nightingale:
What do you mean... necessary?

Shining:
Just like what happened before.

Nightingale:
What happened before... No, I don't want to be like before.

Nightingale:
At the time, they were coming for me. I was locked... I had nowhere to go. I had to heal them.

Shining:
But what about now?

Nightingale:
Now... I'm going everywhere to find them.

Nightingale:
I can feel the pain of those who are sick and hurt, and I don't want them hurt anymore.

Nightingale:
I stretch my hands out to them... to embrace their pain. I have my birdie sing in their ears.

Nightingale:
I never expected the boy would see my birdie. He seemed so happy in his sleep.

Nightingale:
When that happened, those shards that tied me down were gone... Birdie's steps became much lighter too.

Nightingale:
Is that what it means to be happy? Shining, it sounds like I'm happy too.

Shining:
Okay... That's the answer I wanted.

Shining:
Yes, Liz. That's what it means to be happy. You know what it means to be happy now.

Nightingale:
Really? So this is how it's like to be happy. So now I... Mmm...

Shining:
Does it make your heart ache?

Nightingale:
Yes, Shining... It really makes my heart ache.

Nearl:
Why is this happening to Liz? She doesn't have the strength to stand up.

Shining:
This is the outcome of her choice.

Nearl:
Because she treated the kid last night...?

Shining:
Yes, her condition was hardly optimal to begin with. Even the use of simple healing Arts takes its toll on her. Not to mention she was treating acute Oripathy. She's nearing her limits.

Nearl:
If I knew this was going to happen...

Shining:
If you knew, would you have stopped her?

Nightingale:
This is what I wanted to do... I wanted to heal the boy.

Shining:
See? This is what Liz wanted, even though it left her exhausted.

Nearl:
Right... I guess I wouldn't have been able to stop her.

Shining:
Exactly. This is a choice, and these are the choices you two have made. Like Liz, you always choose to sacrifice yourself to treat someone else's pain, whether visible or not.

Shining:
I should've... respected your decisions.

Nightingale:
Shining...

Shining:
But my hope is that... Liz will have more choices available to her.

Shining:
And you too, Margaret. My hope is that you will have more choices too.

Nightingale:
What does it mean to have more choices?

Shining:
You've always wanted to see the world outside, don't you, Liz?

Nightingale:
Yes, that's my greatest wish, Shining. I've been to so many places with you and Nearl.

Nightingale:
These places are beautiful... Hatred and pain sometimes engulf these skies and lands, but that doesn't change the beauty that lies underneath.

Nightingale:
I... I still want to see much more, and not just what the bird sings to me.

Shining:
Yes, it's time we expand our horizons.

Nearl:
It sounds like you just made a decision, Shining.

Shining:
Nearl, do you remember the pharmaceutical company that the patient we treated last time mentioned?

Nearl:
You mean... Rhodes Island?

Shining:
Yes, Rhodes Island.

Shining:
We've been wandering the world all these years. How many patients have we treated altogether?

Nightingale:
I don't remember...

Shining:
It's okay if you don't remember, but, Liz, do you want to treat even more people out there?

Nightingale:
Yes... I want to.

Shining:
Okay. What about you, Nearl?

Nearl:
Rhodes Island, is it...? No objections here.

Nearl:
I trust you, and I trust your decision. If that's where Liz wants to go, then we'll take her there.

Nightingale:
We'll be together...

Shining:
Together.

Shining:
We've made our decision. Let's go, then.

Nightingale:
Let's go...

Nightingale:
...to Rhodes Island.
