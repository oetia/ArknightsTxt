9:30 P.M. Training Grounds

Dobermann:
Thanks for being Bubble's practice partner today.

Dobermann:
It's hard to find someone who can keep the upper hand against her and still have strength to spare.

Dobermann:
And sorry about keeping you so late.

Estelle:
(Instructor Dobermann is strict in training, but very nice otherwise.)

Estelle:
(She's always up until so late at night.)

Estelle:
It's fine, I didn't have anything else anyway.

Estelle:
(It's unbelievable how good Bubble is, given her age.)

Dobermann:
I wish more people would learn from you.

Dobermann:
Are you hungry? It's getting late, so why don't you get something from the cafeteria, and put it on my tab.

Estelle:
Thank you.

9:34 P.M. Cafeteria

Tomimi:
Heat... How do I heat up food?

Tomimi:
Is this the machine?

Tomimi:
It makes a noise, but no heat.

Tomimi:
Is it this one?

Tomimi:
There's a little picture of a fire on it. Does it want you to heat the machine with fire?

Tomimi:
Put the food in the machine, then light a fire outside... like this, right?

Estelle:
Watch out!

Estelle:
Are you okay?

Tomimi:
Why did it explode?

Estelle:
That's not how you use it.

Estelle:
Good thing you didn't get hurt...

Estelle:
(Wait, someone I don't know?!)

Estelle:
(W-What was I thinking? I just reflexively...)

Tomimi:
Wh-What?

Estelle:
(And she's an Archosauria too. A new Archosauria colleague?)

Estelle:
......

Tomimi:
Excuse me, how do I heat up my food...?

Estelle:
Use this one.

Estelle:
I mean... wait 5 minutes, then press this button.

Estelle:
Don't touch the broken one.

Estelle:
Just put in a maintenance ticket, and someone else will fix it.

Estelle:
(Gah, I acted weird again, didn't I?)

Estelle:
(The Doctor and Lena wanted me to interact more with others...)

Estelle:
(I've always used the excuse that it's hard to talk to people who've been here longer than me.)

Estelle:
(But this time, she seems new here.)

Estelle:
(What do I do now...?)

Dobermann:
Done already, Estelle?

Estelle:
Oh...

Estelle:
(I guess I forgot about dinner.)

Estelle:
Yes... I've eaten.

Estelle:
(She might still be in the cafeteria. I'll go later...)

9:22 A.M. Convalescent Garden

Perfumer:
Feeling relaxed?

Estelle:
Mm.

Estelle:
(Lena, code name 'Perfumer.')

Estelle:
(I come here at the same time every day for aromatherapy.)

Estelle:
(It's how I start my day.)

Estelle:
(She smells good, and she's so nice. I wish I had a big sister like her.)

Perfumer:
This scent works best on you.

Estelle:
It... reminds me of home.

Perfumer:
Really?

Estelle:
Yes.

Perfumer:
But it's not the scent of a flower... it's a vitamin solution.

Perfumer:
If you want to talk about your past, I'm here to listen, as is the Doctor.

Estelle:
......

Perfumer:
No pressure, though.

Estelle:
Thank you.

Estelle:
(I know why this scent makes me relaxed... it smells just like the lab I was in when I was little.)

Estelle:
(That was before I grew horns.)

Estelle:
(I lived in a small house. There were many small houses like it in the oval room, each with an Archosauria child living in it.)

Estelle:
(They called me a 'failure' and threw me out of the lab.)

Estelle:
(The guy who did it was named Danny Chip. He even used to say 'Good morning, my princess' to me through the glass every morning...)

Estelle:
(Was I abandoned because I'm so unlikeable?)

Estelle:
(After that, I lived in the barrens until I joined Rhodes Island.)

Perfumer:
I don't know what you're thinking about, but this is a time to relax.

Estelle:
Mm.

Perfumer:
Have you had a proper conversation with anyone lately?

Estelle:
I... don't think so...

Perfumer:
I don't want to force you, but you could try talking to people you feel comfortable with.

Perfumer:
All I can do is to help you temporarily relax. You're the only one who can take that step.

Estelle:
I understand. Thank you Lena.

2:15 P.M. Medical Department Corridor

Breeze:
I heard we have some new colleagues.

Breeze:
Seems like there are new faces every day. Rhodes Island is getting livelier.

Earthspirit:
And the queue at the cafeteria is getting longer too.

Earthspirit:
Taking care of the new employees was easier when there were fewer people around. I can hardly even remember their names these days.

Breeze:
But isn't it your job as a senior member to look after them? Remember how Eyjafjalla used to follow you around like a baby fowlbeast chasing its mother? I think you have a knack for taking care of people.

Fowlbeast:
(Joyful cry)

Breeze:
Whoa! I didn't mean it literally!

Earthspirit:
Calm down, it's just Estelle's Sir Cromwell.

Estelle:
I'm sorry!

Estelle:
(Earthspirit has horns on her head too, but I guess that's normal for a Caprinae.)

Estelle:
(Hers are smaller than mine, but much longer.)

Estelle:
(Would they hit the ceiling if something surprised her in the Doctor's office?)

Estelle:
(If I was closer to her, maybe I could talk to her about how to deal with all the problems with having horns.)

Breeze:
Is this your pet, Estelle?

Estelle:
(Breeze always looks so elegant... I wish I could ask her how to be like that too...)

Estelle:
Yes.

Estelle:
(But Sir Cromwell's not my pet. He's my friend.)

Estelle:
(He's the one who found my house and opened the door after I was thrown out of the lab.)

Estelle:
(He knows so much more than I do, but he doesn't talk much, and he likes to swear.)

Breeze:
There are a number of support missions scheduled for next week. We'll be counting on you, Estelle.

Estelle:
(Breeze is a skilled battlefield medic, so we're often paired together on assignments. Maybe she can sense my discomfort, because she's always so nice and careful around me.)

Estelle:
(I really appreciate it, but she also feels a little distant... and we hardly ever see each other outside of work.)

Estelle:
(The Doctor wants me to take the initiative to talk to her...)

Estelle:
I... I'll work hard to bring the patients back...

Estelle:
(I couldn't say it. Again.)

Estelle:
Sir Cromwell! Don't go! Come back!

Estelle:
You'll cause trouble for others... and make my coworkers dislike me.

Estelle:
Come to think of it, they were just talking about taking care of new recruits...

Estelle:
What about that Archosauria I saw yesterday? Does she have anyone to help her?

Estelle:
She'll get hurt if she's reckless around machines again, like last time.

Estelle:
But... what can I do? When I'm like... this?

Sir Cromwell:
(Meaningful crow)

Estelle:
Stop laughing, Sir Cromwell.

Sir Cromwell:
(Soft humming)

Estelle:
I'm getting treatment and going to the Convalescent Garden every day. But I'm still nervous about meeting others of my kind.

Estelle:
I can see at a glance how different I am from them... so won't they too? Will they think my horns are disgusting?

Sir Cromwell:
(Short chirping)

Estelle:
Gavial?

Estelle:
Right...

Estelle:
Gavial is an Archosauria too. I see her often at work, but I could never muster the courage to speak to her... I don't know what she thinks of me.

Estelle:
*Sigh* We're both Archosauria, but she's a great doctor, while I can't seem to do anything right.

Injured Operator:
Wait! Gavial, I'm not ready yet!

Gavial:
Wait for what? It'll be over in the blink of an eye.

Injured Operator:
The blink of an... arrrggghhh!

Estelle:
Is she on duty today?

Estelle:
I always hear cries like this when she is.

Estelle:
I wonder what's happening inside...

Sir Cromwell:
(Curious crow)

Estelle:
Wait, where are you going—

Estelle:
(It's the girl who almost blew herself up yesterday!)

Tomimi:
Huh? You're...

Estelle:
(She saw me!)

Tomimi:
Wait!

Tomimi:
S-She's strong...

Estelle:
Oh no!

Estelle:
Are you okay? I'm sorry... I...

Tomimi:
Oh, I'm fine!

Tomimi:
You're so strong!

Estelle:
Er... yeah...

Estelle:
Sorry...

Tomimi:
It's okay!

Tomimi:
I have to thank you for yesterday. I wouldn't have known how to heat up my food if you hadn't been there.

Estelle:
I just happened to pass by and saw...

Estelle:
......

Estelle:
I, er, I'm a little busy right now, so—

Gavial:
Man, my hands are getting sore. Watch over the wounded while I go loosen up my arms a little.

Gavial:
Mm, fresh air!

Gavial:
Huh? Did I just see someone skitter by?

Gavial:
Maybe I'm just tired?

Tomimi:
Whew, she almost found us. Good thing there was an empty room here.

Tomimi:
I saved you this time, so we're even!

Estelle:
Huh?

Tomimi:
It'd be bad if Gavial found out.

Estelle:
W-What do you mean?

Tomimi:
You came to spy on Gavial at work, didn't you?

Estelle:
(This newcomer seems to have misunderstood... I need to explain, or I'll leave a bad impression on her...)

Estelle:
I'm not—

Tomimi:
I came to spy on her too!

Tomimi:
Do you know her well?

Estelle:
Er... I guess so...?

Estelle:
(I often work with her, but we've barely spoken to each other.)

Tomimi:
You like her, don't you?

Estelle:
(She's a doctor of Rhodes Island. She lives in a different world from someone like me, who's doing odd jobs while receiving treatment.)

Estelle:
(When I think of it like that, it's easy enough to convince myself that hiding from her like this is normal.)

Estelle:
Well, yes, I think she's amazing.

Tomimi:
Then we're friends.

Estelle:
Friends... you want to be friends with me?

Tomimi:
We already know each other, and we both agree Gavial's amazing!

Estelle:
I... guess so...

Tomimi:
Then we're friends.

Estelle:
I see.

Estelle:
(I made friends with a new recruit...)

Estelle:
(I should report to the Doctor and Lena.)

Estelle:
(I didn't do anything in particular, but I'm sure they'll be proud of me.)

Tomimi:
My name's Tomimi. What about you?

Estelle:
I'm... Estelle.

Estelle:
(Calm down. Keep it friendly by making small talk.)

Estelle:
(You can do it.)

Tomimi:
Is it a code name?

Estelle:
No, it's my real name.

Tomimi:
It doesn't sound Archosauria.

Estelle:
Um...

Tomimi:
It sounds familiar though.

Tomimi:
Is it the Ash Princess?

Estelle:
You know her?

Tomimi:
I heard the story from Inam.

Estelle:
Estelle the Ash Princess was chased out from her castle when bad people took over. But she never gave up, and kept working on her swordsmanship.

Estelle:
When the time came, she snuck into a party at the castle in a dress, with the help of the loyal Sir Cromwell.

Estelle:
And at the climax, she put on her armor, caught the sword thrown to her by Sir Cromwell, and completed her revenge.

Estelle:
Some say that she turned to ash once her goal was complete.

Estelle:
......

Estelle:
(Oh no, I started talking and just kept going...)

Estelle:
(Is it going to put her off? I really should learn to keep my mouth shut...)

Tomimi:
Wow.

Tomimi:
You really know the story!

Tomimi:
I can tell how much you admire her.

Estelle:
Yes... I want to be like her.

Estelle:
(She... doesn't seem so scary.)

Estelle:
(I wish I could wear a helmet like the princess though.)

Estelle:
(They say Rhodes Island has good blacksmiths, but I don't know any of them. Since I don't use weapons in battle, I've never gone to talk to one.)

Estelle:
(I should muster the courage to go ask them to make me a suit of armor, like the one the princess wore.)

Tomimi:
You should practice the sword then.

Estelle:
Yes...

Estelle:
(And learn how to fight using weapons.)

Estelle:
(Learning from someone who uses a greatsword... Skadi, maybe...? But it's hard to talk to her...)

Tomimi:
But why did you run away when you saw me?

Estelle:
Er, it's nothing...

Estelle:
......

Estelle:
I'm, well, not very confident about my appearance...

Tomimi:
Appearance?

Tomimi:
Turn around and let me take a look.

Tomimi:
By our standards, it's neither thick or thin... It doesn't really stand out.

Tomimi:
But...

Tomimi:
Doesn't that mean that it's normal?

Estelle:
Really?

Estelle:
I look normal to you?

Estelle:
But back home, people laughed at me and called me a weirdo because of it...

Tomimi:
They don't understand. Sometimes, it's prettier this way.

Tomimi:
Like, take Gavial—

Estelle:
(Did Gavial have horns too?)

Tomimi:
People like her not just because of how she looks, but because of how strong she is, the way she's invincible in battle.

Estelle:
Oh—ah!

Estelle:
So you mean I should become strong?

Tomimi:
Not quite.

Tomimi:
I've thought about it a lot, and I think the reason people like Gavial is because she's Gavial.

Estelle:
I don't understand.

Tomimi:
Be yourself. The people who like you will like you. You don't have to make yourself uncomfortable just to get people to like you.

Estelle:
R-Really?

Estelle:
(That's how another Archosauria sees my horns?)

Tomimi:
I once read a book called 'One Step from Confidence.' It said that people's tastes change all the time; the important thing is what you think about yourself.

Tomimi:
Come find me if you want to borrow it.

Estelle:
Thank you.

Estelle:
It's really a pain sometimes though. I might accidentally poke the door when I'm going to the Doctor's office, and it's harder to swing a sword like the Ash Princess.

Tomimi:
Hm... I guess so.

Tomimi:
But not only does it help you balance, it can also be used as a weapon. That more than makes up for making it a little harder to swing a sword.

Tomimi:
So if you think about it, a tail is very useful.

Estelle:
I see!

Estelle:
(So she was talking about my tail...? I guess she misunderstood what I meant... I like my tail...)

Estelle:
(My horns are heavy, but the tail helps me keep my balance.)

Estelle:
(It's a good tail.)

Estelle:
(But she seems totally unconcerned about my horns... I guess not everyone cares about them... I didn't expect it to be so easy to talk to another Archosauria...)

Tomimi:
I like you too.

Estelle:
Really?!

Tomimi:
Yes. That's why we're friends.

Tomimi:
Not as good as Gavial, but like, 0.7 Gavials.

Estelle:
T-Thank you!

Estelle:
(Does she use Gavial as a unit of measurement?)

Estelle:
(0.7 Gavials must be high praise.)

Estelle:
So... how many Gavials is the Doctor?

Tomimi:
Never thought about it...

Tomimi:
Maybe we can score everyone on Rhodes Island later.

Estelle:
Measured in Gavials?

Tomimi:
Yes.

Estelle:
Mm.

Tomimi:
Let's do it!

Tomimi:
Oh, looks like Gavial went back.

Tomimi:
Let's go spy on her again.

Estelle:
Sorry... I have to get back to work.

Estelle:
(Rhodes Island might throw me out if I don't work hard enough...)

Tomimi:
What do you do here, Estelle? Are you in the combat squad too?

Estelle:
Huh?

Estelle:
(Where'd that come from?)

Estelle:
(Is this how friends talk?)

Estelle:
I am, but I usually work more on the support and rescue side.

Estelle:
Like carrying stuff, moving patients, or evacuating the wounded.

Estelle:
Sometimes I'm also involved in direct combat, like when rescuing the wounded in the heat of battle.

Estelle:
Or escorting our doctors.

Tomimi:
Incredible...

Estelle:
It's nothing, really...

Tomimi:
Just imagine being hurt on the battlefield, surrounded by enemies and at your wit's end, then seeing Estelle dash to the rescue.

Tomimi:
You'd shine so brightly in their eyes. You might even go as high as 0.9 Gavials!

Estelle:
Really?!

Estelle:
(So even a job like this earns people's respect.)

Tomimi:
Even better if you deliver them straight to Gavial for treatment.

Estelle:
0.9 Gavials plus 1 Gavial is... 8 Gavials...?

Tomimi:
Yes, they'll recover even quicker, for sure.

Estelle:
Right. I'll try to send them to Gavial next time then.

Estelle:
But, er, I really do have to go... it's getting late.

Tomimi:
It was nice chatting with you.

Estelle:
Me too.

Estelle:
(I wish I could keep things at 0.9 Gavials.)

7:23 P.M. Engineering Department

Estelle:
(I never knew making a friend would make me so happy.)

Greypaw:
Oh? You're still working, Estelle?

Estelle:
Um...

Estelle:
Breeze said there might be dispatch missions next week, so I wanted to load some supplies first.

Greypaw:
There's no overtime pay for this, you know.

Estelle:
That's fine.

Estelle:
(I often ride in Greypaw's car when I'm on a mission with Breeze.)

Estelle:
(The roof's been modified to give more room for supplies, and more importantly, my horns.)

Estelle:
(I'm less nervous when I'm talking to someone I know.)

Greypaw:
Kids like you should learn to rest when you can.

Greypaw:
Otherwise, you'll pay the price when you get older.

Greypaw:
Just look at all the neck and back pain I get.

Greypaw:
A few more long-distance trips, and I'd just about break into a thousand pieces.

Estelle:
Does it hurt that much?

Greypaw:
Yeah.

Estelle:
......

Estelle:
I think I know how to help.

Estelle:
(I wonder if Gavial's still on duty.)

Greypaw:
Really? Hope it works.

Greypaw:
Wait—

8:20 P.M. Medical Department Corridor

Tomimi:
You're back, Estelle.

Estelle:
I just brought a colleague who's not feeling well.

Tomimi:
Looks like Gavial's gonna be there for a while longer.

Tomimi:
I'm waiting to eat with her.

Estelle:
I'm waiting for Greypaw's treatment to finish.

Greypaw:
Wait, it's just a bit of neck pain!

Gavial:
Well, since you're here, how about a little massage?

Greypaw:
No! I'm fine! It doesn't hurt at all!

Greypaw:
Aaaaaaaahhhh––!

Tomimi:
Sounds like it's working well.

Estelle:
Is it?

Tomimi:
Forceful treatment always works well.

Estelle:
That's true.

Tomimi:
What are you smiling about?

Estelle:
Oh, it's nothing.

Estelle:
(I'm glad to have made a friend, and to have helped a colleague.)

Estelle:
(Even though I still couldn't say it.)

Estelle:
(At Rhodes Island, no one laughs at my horns, or scolds me for being clumsy.)

Estelle:
(There's still a lot I don't know, but I'm learning every day.)

Tomimi:
Oh, looks like they're done.

Gavial:
Hey, Tomimi.

Tomimi:
I made a new friend, Gavial!

Tomimi:
Look!

Tomimi:
Huh? Where did she go?

Gavial:
Who?

Gavial:
You're not seeing things, are you?

Estelle:
(Whew...)

Estelle:
(I ran away again.)

Estelle:
(Looks like I still have a long way to go.)

The Archosauria girl sighs, lifts her head, and presses herself against the walls of the clinic, horns and all.

There is no smell of vitamin solution, but she feels surprisingly relaxed.

The dark night and scattered stars outside the windows are no different from what she'd seen out on the barrens for so many years.

Today, however, she is home. Here at Rhodes Island.
