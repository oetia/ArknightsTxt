In the blood-red glow of the fire, each person is reduced to a vague silhouette, cast over the mottled ruins.

Once they fought side by side, through the valley of the shadow of death.

Yet now, only hatred and animosity remain in their gazes towards one another.

Heavyrain:
(What happened...?)

Heavyrain:
(It's like... everyone went crazy.)

Sargonian Veteran:
Allaenat!

Sargonian Veteran:
Do you even realize the hell I went through getting back here alive? And before I get even a single hot meal, you want me rushing off to the front lines again?

Sargonian Janissary:
Fall back! All of you, fall back!

Sargonian Janissary:
Is this a mutiny?!

Sargonian Veteran:
Mutiny? I'm gonna kill you, ayyuha al'ahmaq.

Sargonian Veteran:
Grab him! Don't let him get away!

Sargonian Janissary:
Move it! Out of the way!

Sargonian Veteran:
Heavyrain! Quick!

Sargonian Veteran:
Stop him! Don't let him run!

Heavyrain:
(I think I know who he is...)

Heavyrain:
(What was he called again?)

Sargonian Veteran:
What are you spacing out for?! Kill him!

Sargonian Janissary:
MOVE!

Heavyrain:
Urgh!

Sargonian Veteran:
Damn it!

Sargonian Veteran:
Heavyrain, how could you let him get away?!

Heavyrain:
(All my comrades are staring at me. They look so hostile.) I'm sorry.

Heavyrain:
(It's like... I'm their enemy now too.) But I don't hurt my comrades.

Sargonian Veteran:
Comrades? Heh...

Sargonian Veteran:
You think any of those sacks of shit on our side?

His punch hits Heavyrain square in the face.

The veteran pants insatiably, just waiting for Heavyrain to hit back, dying to vent his anger in combat.

But she doesn't. She simply picks up her shield, her expression calm.

No hesitation, nor any show of fear.

Heavyrain:
I'm sorry.

Heavyrain:
But I will never hurt my comrades.

Sargonian Veteran:
......

Sargonian Veteran:
*spit*! Coward.

Old Captain:
Enough! This is no time to be screwing with our own.

Sargonian Veteran:
Boss, we should make a break for it.

Sargonian Veteran:
While we still have the chance.

Old Captain:
Run? What about our families back home?

Old Captain:
We're all brothers from the same hometown. If the lord ameer ever feels like going after them, his job will be easy.

Sargonian Veteran:
Allaenat!

Sargonian Veteran:
Those bastards were never going to let us live in the first place.

Old Captain:
I told you to think before you act. Do you regret it now?

Sargonian Veteran:
......

Sargonian Veteran:
I can't take this. I can't watch my brothers be thrown out to die like this.

Old Captain:
Enough, words won't solve this anymore. They can defend the entrance for now.

Old Captain:
The janissaries and officers are all the children of nobles. With them as hostages, whoever's outside... won't be so quick to act.

Sargonian Veteran:
Right.

The years-long campaign has taken these people—far from their homes and their families—and left them with no one but their fellow troops.

It's only natural for those from the same hometown to look after one another, unable to bear their companions suffering even the slightest abuse.

But under such innately oppressive circumstances, strife still remains common.

Sargonian Veteran:
You cowards screwed up last time by being the first to run. I had the enemy tear at my ass for three whole days before I made it out.

Dispirited Straggler:
Khalas! Who are you calling a coward?!

Dispirited Straggler:
If it wasn't for you shit for brains, I wouldn't even be trapped in here!

Sargonian Veteran:
Say that again, ya waghadi?

Dispirited Straggler:
Wanna go, huh? Bring it! Put your money where your mouth is!

Sargonian Veteran:
Fine, let's go!

Heavyrain:
......

Anum:
Not going to help? You're just going to watch?

Heavyrain:
Who would I help?

Anum:
Who do you care about more?

Heavyrain:
......

Anum:
Then who do you think is in the right?

Heavyrain:
They... none of them.

Heavyrain:
Sargonian mercenaries shouldn't be fighting each other for no reason like this.

Anum:
...*sigh* I knew you weren't like the others, Heavyrain.

Heavyrain:
What?

Anum:
There's no should or shouldn't when it comes to soldiers...

Anum:
Only want or don't want, obey or disobey.

Anum:
How come you got even less food than me?

Anum:
Don't vets get a little more?

Heavyrain:
It's fine. It's enough.

Heavyrain:
Having more or less doesn't make a difference.

Anum:
......

Anum:
Oh.

Heavyrain:
(Anum sort of looks like she's in despair.)

Heavyrain:
(Is she worried for me?)

Heavyrain:
Anum.

Anum:
Hm?

Heavyrain:
To tell the truth...

Heavyrain:
I knew the person who ran this afternoon.

Anum:
You did? But the janissaries never associate with people like us.

Heavyrain:
In our last battle, it was me who pulled him out from a pile of bodies.

Heavyrain:
He told me his name was Ibrahim.

Heavyrain:
We hid from the Casters pursuing us together.

Anum:
So he's your friend?

Heavyrain:
Not a friend. A comrade.

Anum:
What's the difference?

Heavyrain:
...It's hard to put in words.

Heavyrain:
But they're not the same.

Anum:
Do you remember how this whole mess started?

Heavyrain:
The officer got the order to send everyone back to the front.

Anum:
And then?

Heavyrain:
The veterans felt they were too injured from the last battle and wanted more supplies and rest. Then it got out of hand.

Anum:
So, who do you think was in the right?

Heavyrain:
I understand what the veterans are thinking, but...

Anum:
Regardless, you hesitated.

Anum:
And to the others, it felt like a betrayal.

Heavyrain:
......

Heavyrain:
I'd never betray anyone.

Heavyrain:
I just don't understand...

Heavyrain:
We save him one moment, and then we have to kill him the next.

Anum:
Then what if it was someone else running toward you back there?

Anum:
Someone who'd clashed with you before, even.

Anum:
Would you retaliate then? Would you want to?

Heavyrain:
......

Heavyrain:
If I said no, would you think I'm a coward, Anum?

Anum:
No... Because I knew you'd say that.

Anum:
You see everyone as a comrade.

Heavyrain:
Because we are. Because we're Sargonian soldiers. Because we swore an oath.

Heavyrain:
'Never kneel to the enemy in the face of danger. Never abandon your comrades in times of need.'

Heavyrain:
Personal grudges and desires... don't really matter to me much.

Anum:
Eh...?

Anum:
Look at this food they gave us!

Anum:
You could turn the plate upside down and it wouldn't fall off!

Heavyrain:
Stop messing with it. If it does fall, you'll have nothing to eat.

Anum:
Mm-hmm.

Anum:
If that happened, would you give me yours?

Heavyrain:
Yes.

Anum:
Because I'm your comrade?

Heavyrain:
Because you're my friend.

Anum:
Friend, comrade... you keep repeating those words.

Anum:
Is there really a difference?

Heavyrain:
......

Heavyrain:
Yes.

???:
Heavyrain.

???:
Wake up.

Heavyrain:
(Hostiles?!)

Heavyrain:
(No!) What happened?!

Anum:
Lower your blade...

Anum:
It's me, no need to panic.

Heavyrain:
(Dammit... that was too dangerous.) Oh...

Heavyrain:
(Good thing I didn't hurt Anum.) I'm sorry.

Anum:
It's fine. But I need your help right now.

Anum:
Come with me.

Heavyrain:
Okay.

Anum:
Here's the situation. Neither of their fevers are breaking, and they've been shaking the whole time.

Anum:
If we don't cure them ASAP, they're dead for sure.

Heavyrain:
(Their wounds haven't been treated at all.)

Heavyrain:
(There's so much rot.) What do you need me to do?

Anum:
The vets are watching all the supplies, and refuse to help in any way.

Anum:
I assume you know where they keep them. Can you think of a way to bring anything back?

Anum:
They're your comrades, after all.

Heavyrain:
(Comrades...) You don't need to convince me.

Heavyrain:
(Did she really have to stress it like that?) I'll go and try.

Dispirited Straggler:
If you didn't stop me just now, I swear I would've taken them on.

Dispirited Straggler:
Can we trust her?

Anum:
Have faith. Heavyrain's a good person.

Anum:
She gave her word, so she'll do it.

Dispirited Straggler:
A good person?

Dispirited Straggler:
There's no such thing as a good person in the army, only fools and idiots.

Anum:
......

Anum:
True.

Anum:
Who's there?!

???:
Shit, we've been noticed!

???:
Deal with them! Don't make too much noise.

Anum:
Wait! We're in a tough spot too!

Anum:
So... can we make a deal?

Heavyrain:
(So dark...)

Heavyrain:
(I know this is where they put the medicine...)

Heavyrain:
(These are the bandages, so the disinfectant should be right next to them.)

???:
Who's there?

Heavyrain:
(Oh, no... I can't let them find me.)

Heavyrain:
(Just hide this stuff in my clothes...)

Sargonian Veteran:
What was that noise?! Who is it?!

Old Captain:
...Me!

Old Captain:
I'm looking for something.

Sargonian Veteran:
Oh.

Heavyrain:
......

Old Captain:
......

Old Captain:
Heavyrain, was it meds you took?

Old Captain:
All by yourself?

Heavyrain:
(He's turning off the lights?)

Heavyrain:
(What is he going to do?!)

Old Captain:
Relax, you don't want anyone else finding you here, right?

Old Captain:
Okay, so what's going on? Who's hurt?

Heavyrain:
(Should I tell him?)

Heavyrain:
(If I just leave, will he stop me?)

Old Captain:
If you don't want to say... the door's over here. Be sure not to make any more noise.

Heavyrain:
......

Heavyrain:
Two recruits have... untreated wounds. They have high fevers.

Old Captain:
What meds did you take?

Heavyrain:
These.

Old Captain:
Hm... disinfectant and bandages. You know how to treat wounds, then?

Heavyrain:
Yes. I've learned before.

Old Captain:
Good. Remember to remove anything that's rotting.

Old Captain:
We're out of anesthetics... They'll just have to grin and bear it.

Old Captain:
Take these antibiotics too, they'll be key to saving their lives. That's about all I can give you, though.

Old Captain:
Obviously, it'd be best to get them to a hospital. But clearly that's not on the table.

Heavyrain:
Thank you...

Heavyrain:
See you, then.

Old Captain:
......

Old Captain:
Wait, Heavyrain.

Heavyrain:
Hm?

Old Captain:
Are you hurt? Do you feel bad anywhere?

Heavyrain:
No.

Old Captain:
*sigh*... I remember trying to reason with your mother, when she handed you over to me.

Old Captain:
You were barely out of diapers...

Heavyrain:
......

Old Captain:
Never mind. Hurry. Stay out of sight on your way back.

Heavyrain:
Can I ask something?

Heavyrain:
Abi?

Old Captain:
Huh? What?

Old Captain:
Where's this coming from? You haven't called me that in years.

Heavyrain:
We swore, before, that we'd root out all of Sargon's enemies.

Heavyrain:
But now it's Sargonian soldiers surrounding us.

Heavyrain:
It's Sargonian soldiers we're holding hostage.

Heavyrain:
Everyone here's a Sargonian soldier, and they fight each other every day.

Heavyrain:
Who is our enemy? What is an enemy?

Heavyrain:
What do I... do?

Abi:
Heavyrain.

Abi:
Let me ask you something first.

Heavyrain:
Okay.

Abi:
If I was hurt, you would help me too, wouldn't you?

Heavyrain:
Definitely.

Abi:
Why?

Heavyrain:
Because we're Sargonian soldiers. We never abandon our comrades.

Abi:
Then suppose I wasn't your comrade, and I wasn't wearing this uniform.

Abi:
I was just some stranger, begging for your aid. Would you help me?

Heavyrain:
Yes.

Abi:
Then what if I asked you to risk your life to rescue me?

Abi:
Put everything on the line to help a stranger. Would you?

Heavyrain:
......

Heavyrain:
I don't know.

Abi:
To put it frankly, serving Sargon, eh... it just means you wear these clothes. Seems like they're all that ties us together.

Abi:
But even without them, you'd still be you, I'd still be me, and anyone'd still be anyone. Everyone has their own identities, their own perspectives, their own goals.

Abi:
Even you. You have little ideas of your own, don't you? You'd risk your life to steal meds for your comrades.

Heavyrain:
I...

Heavyrain:
...was only doing it because...

Abi:
Hahaha, I know.

Abi:
You're a good kid. You regard every soldier as an comrade.

Abi:
But what about if you took off the uniform? Who are you then?

Heavyrain:
(If I left this uniform behind, if I wasn't a Sargonian soldier anymore...)

Heavyrain:
(What would I do?)

Heavyrain:
(Go home?)

Abi:
Enough, I'd better get back to checking on the lookouts.

Abi:
Heavyrain... take care of yourself.

Heavyrain:
I will...

Heavyrain:
Abi.

Sargonian Janissary:
We can execute traitors on the spot. What matters most is we ensure the hostages are safe.

Anum:
Will you keep your word? That if we work with you...

Sargonian Janissary:
If you're willing to turn back and cease this crime of betraying the lord ameer...

Sargonian Janissary:
Then I trust our superiors will reconsider your punishment.

Dispirited Straggler:
...They... We all got dragged into this, no one asked us.

Dispirited Straggler:
We never intended to betray the lord ameer!

Sargonian Janissary:
Of course.

Dispirited Straggler:
I swear!!!

Sargonian Janissary:
The only thing that matters is how you choose to act.

Timid Recruit:
Anum, someone's coming!

Sargonian Janissary:
We can't wait for you forever.

Sargonian Janissary:
Make up your minds.

Heavyrain:
I'm back. How are they?

Anum:
Still running a high fever. Did you find the meds?

Heavyrain:
Yeah. Help me redress their wounds.

Heavyrain:
They need to tough it out. I have to cut away all the rotting parts.

Heavyrain:
Then get them to take these antibiotics.

Gutless Recruit:
Heavyrain...

Gutless Recruit:
Thank you.

Heavyrain:
It's nothing.

Heavyrain:
Anum, come and help me undo their old bandages.

Anum:
Alright.

Anum:
You treat their wounds. I'll get some people to fetch things.

Heavyrain:
Okay.

Anum:
(Whisper) You, all of you, come with me.

Anum:
This is our last chance. Are you in?

Timid Recruit:
I...

Timid Recruit:
But the veterans...

Anum:
You're scared, aren't you?

Timid Recruit:
......

Anum:
Do you want to die here? With those idiots?

Anum:
How about the rest of you, then?

Dispirited Straggler:
...Do you really think we have a chance? It's not like we outnumber them.

Dispirited Straggler:
And will the lord ameer really let us go?

Anum:
You said it yourself, didn't you? What's the difference between us, when we all make our livings as soldiers?

Anum:
Or do you want to explain to the people outside how you're innocent while they have a blade against your throat?

Dispirited Straggler:
(Deep breath)

Dispirited Straggler:
Khalas! Fine. Lead the way.

Dispirited Straggler:
Your friend there, is she going to help us?

Anum:
Heavyrain... I'll ask her.

Anum:
If it comes down to it...

Dispirited Straggler:
You're going to kill her? Isn't she your friend?

Anum:
She is, and a good person too.

Anum:
But she can never figure out where she stands, or what matters. She's too nice to everyone.

Dispirited Straggler:
......

Anum:
You said it yourself, didn't you?

Anum:
There's no such thing as a good person in the army, only fools and idiots.

Anum:
Right?

Dispirited Straggler:
You got me there.

Timid Recruit:
What... What are you looking at me for?!

Timid Recruit:
I... I'll go with you.

Heavyrain:
Their wounds are redressed now, and they've taken the drugs.

Heavyrain:
Their foreheads aren't as hot anymore.

Heavyrain:
(Something's not right about Anum's expression.) They'll recover.

Anum:
Heavyrain.

Anum:
If the war ends, and you leave the army, what would you want to do?

Heavyrain:
(Where's this coming from?)

Heavyrain:
I... haven't thought about it.

Anum:
You've really never considered what you want to do? Or who you care about?

Heavyrain:
What I want to do...

Heavyrain:
No.

Heavyrain:
Who I care about...

Heavyrain:
You.

Heavyrain:
And everyone else...

Anum:
Oh, honestly, Heavyrain.

Heavyrain:
(Everyone here is gauging me. They're looking to see how I react.)

Heavyrain:
(And they're packing their gear.)

Heavyrain:
(......)

Heavyrain:
Anum, if there's something you want to say...

Heavyrain:
You can just tell me.

Anum:
......

Anum:
Then if I asked you to help me capture the mutinying soldiers, would you say yes?

Heavyrain:
What?!

Anum:
Regardless of what you think, you're out of options. We're all enemies of Sargon at this point.

Anum:
But just now, we were lucky enough to get one last chance.

Anum:
We can survive this.

Heavyrain:
(Is that really lucky?)

Heavyrain:
(Survive...)

Heavyrain:
(For a reason like that, and nothing else...) Is there no other way?

Anum:
No.

Anum:
You can't avoid the problem anymore.

Anum:
You treat them as comrades, but they don't see you that way.

Anum:
Do you still not get it?

Heavyrain:
(The way they treat me...) I do.

Heavyrain:
(...doesn't really matter...) But I don't mind.

Heavyrain:
I just can't do it. Not when it's just to survive.

Anum:
Then I'll do it for you.

Heavyrain:
(Am I too weak...?) Anum!

Anum:
I'm sorry.

Dispirited Straggler:
Hyah!

Heavyrain:
Ugh!

Dispirited Straggler:
Are we killing her?

Dispirited Straggler:
I'll be honest, I've been afraid of you stabbing me in the back at some point.

Anum:
......

Anum:
Tie her up.

Timid Recruit:
Right... She did save our lives, after all.

Anum:
Heavyrain, you were never weak. You're just shackled by that oath of yours.

Anum:
The lord ameer doesn't want you to have your own desires. The officers are scared of seeing your hatred.

Anum:
You're a good person.

Anum:
So this time, I'll do it for you.

Anum:
But you owe me one.

Anum:
Because you promised you'd protect me.

Anum:
Because I want to survive.

Anum:
I want to survive with you.

Sargonian Veteran:
What's that little wench's problem?

Sargonian Veteran:
She's been with us for half a year now and she still doesn't talk. She just stands there by herself, watching us.

Abi:
Children are scared of strangers.

Abi:
She's a good person, once you get to know her.

Sargonian Veteran:
......

Sargonian Veteran:
Girl!

Sargonian Veteran:
Get over here, help us out.

Heavyrain:
(Does he mean me?)

Sargonian Veteran:
Go, take this roll call. You see that lost-looking bunch over there?

Sargonian Veteran:
Them. Go fetch those recruits.

Heavyrain:
(It's another new batch.)

Heavyrain:
(It hasn't been a month since the last one.) Okay.

Anum:
Hey.

Anum:
Are you a vet here?

Heavyrain:
(She's younger than me.)

Heavyrain:
Right.

Anum:
You see this gold star?

Heavyrain:
Mm.

Anum:
This is a spoil of war. I got it from some ruins.

Anum:
I'll give this to you, so protect me if they try to bully me, okay?

Heavyrain:
......

Heavyrain:
Why?

Anum:
Huh? Because I hear the vets always bully the new recruits here.

Anum:
But from where I'm standing, you seem different.

Heavyrain:
No, I mean, why give this to me?

Heavyrain:
It's yours. I don't need it.

Heavyrain:
And besides, I wouldn't bully my own comrades.

Anum:
......

Anum:
You're a weird one.

Anum:
I'm Anum.

Heavyrain:
...I'm Heavyrain.

Heavyrain:
Now, back to your unit, please.

The choking scent of smoke—and the familiar-yet-terrifying battle cries—bring Heavyrain out of her daze in a snap.

Instinctively, she tries to reach for her weapon, but quickly discovers that she has been bound fast to a pillar.

Heavyrain:
(Dammit... Anum, you impulsive bastard...)

Heavyrain:
(I have to find her...)

Tear gas fills the room.

Heavyrain grits her teeth and after some effort dislocates her own arm to writhe it free of the rope. Her clenched jaw manages to stop her from screaming in pain.

Sargonian Janissary:
Death to the rebels!

Heavyrain:
(No matter what, I need to find Anum, and Abi.) Anum!

Heavyrain:
(Anum... where is she?) Abi!

Sargonian Veteran:
(Heavy breathing) Huff... huff...

Sargonian Veteran:
Hahaha, we're all comrades, huh?

Sargonian Veteran:
*spit*! You betrayed us after all.

Heavyrain:
(Betrayed?) You...

Heavyrain:
(I didn't...) I'll treat your wounds.

Sargonian Veteran:
Stay back!

Sargonian Veteran:
Haram alayk, trying to trick me like the hypocrite you are.

Sargonian Veteran:
You think I'm your path to glory?

Sargonian Veteran:
Bring it!

Heavyrain:
(We lived and died as comrades...)

Heavyrain:
(Now we fight to the end as enemies?)

Sargonian Veteran:
Allaenat, I'll go out with honor!

Sargonian Veteran:
And you? Selling out your own comrades to survive?

Heavyrain:
(I was never going to sell anyone out...)

Heavyrain:
(Everyone's treating me as an enemy...)

Sargonian Veteran:
Honor? Oaths? You're nothing but a coward!

Sargonian Veteran:
You're just scared to do wrong, scared of being blamed, scared to be a bad person.

Sargonian Veteran:
And for what? Even if my brothers choose wrong, I'd still give everything I have for them! I don't fear it!

Sargonian Veteran:
There's no true right or wrong when you're a soldier, anyway.

Heavyrain:
(I...)

Sargonian Veteran:
Come. Aren't you going to kill me?

Sargonian Veteran:
Even if I die, I have my brothers with me. Lucky me!

Sargonian Veteran:
What about you? What's waiting for you, even if you survive?

Sargonian Veteran:
*spit*!

Heavyrain:
...You're right.

Anum:
Heavyrain, you were never weak. You're just shackled by that oath of yours.

Anum:
So this time, I'll do it for you.

Heavyrain:
(My parents always told me to obey, to listen.) I never did wrong at home. I tried hard to show them I was a good kid, but in the end I was still kicked out.

Heavyrain:
Because our harvest was bad, and we couldn't survive. No other reason.

Heavyrain:
(Oaths, virtue, honor...) I think of everyone as a comrade, and try to help them, and I'm scared of doing the wrong thing.

Heavyrain:
(...are they really just lies here?) But even so, this is how it all turned out...

Heavyrain:
If it's like you say... there's no should or shouldn't, no right or wrong...

Heavyrain:
(Just like Anum said.) Then I'm willing to bear it... to bear all of the consequences for Anum.

Heavyrain:
I'll protect her.

Heavyrain:
(Forgive me.)

Sargonian Veteran:
Agh!!

Heavyrain:
(I can just use my shield...) Huff...

Heavyrain:
(I don't need to actually kill him.)

Heavyrain:
Anum!

Heavyrain:
Where are you?

Anum:
Once we have you, this entire clown show will be over.

Anum:
We'll all still have a chance to survive.

Old Captain:
Survive? Aren't you a greedy one...

Old Captain:
You're not fit to be a soldier of Sargon.

Anum:
A soldier?

Anum:
You really think anyone gives a damn?

Old Captain:
Drop dead.

Heavyrain:
(Dammit...) Anum!

Heavyrain:
(Why did it have to be Abi...) Abi?

Anum:
Heavyrain!

Anum:
Help me.

Heavyrain:
......

Abi:
Made up your mind?

Heavyrain:
(I'm sorry...) Abi, I didn't want it to be this way.

Heavyrain:
(If there was any other choice...) But Anum's my friend, so...

Heavyrain:
I can't let you hurt her.

Abi:
Friend...

Abi:
Hahahaha! Come on! Show me then!

Heavyrain:
What?!

Heavyrain:
Urgh!

Anum:
Heavyrain! Watch out!

Anum:
I'm coming!

Abi:
Move it!

Anum:
Argh!

Heavyrain:
Anum!

Heavyrain:
Abi!!!

Abi:
For your friend's sake, eh! Good on you!

Abi:
Now again, Heavyrain!

Heavyrain:
Urgh!

Abi:
You're not going to defeat me just by defending. You know.

Abi:
You're still wavering?

Abi:
You need to protect your friend, and right now, I'm your enemy.

Heavyrain:
(The worst outcome...)

Anum:
Heavyrain! Dammit... ufff...

Anum:
Guys! Help us!

Anum:
Seize the traitor!

Abi:
*sigh*... Looks like we're out of time.

Abi:
You'll have to forgive me for taking the reins, then.

Heavyrain:
What?

Abi:
Hyah!

Heavyrain:
Agh!!

Anum:
Heavyrain!

Abi:
The finishing blow!

Heavyrain:
(We're going to die...)

Heavyrain:
(No!) Aaaaarrgh!

Abi:
Come!!!

Abi slashed at Heavyrain. Heavyrain lifts her shield with all she has, every drop of strength poured into her charge against him.

Yet in the single moment her view is blocked...

The old vet...

Turns his blade...

And plunges it into his own body.

Heavyrain:
WHY?!?!?!

Heavyrain:
NO!!!

Heavyrain:
WHY?! Abi!!!

Heavyrain:
Why are you doing this?!

Abi:
Take my blade.

Heavyrain:
No...

Abi:
Take it! Quick!

Abi:
While they still haven't noticed.

Heavyrain:
No! I won't!

Heavyrain:
The warehouse! There's still meds there!

Abi:
Astamaʿa li!

Abi:
Al-'aan! I'm telling you to take it!

Abi:
TAKE IT!

Heavyrain:
Abi...

Abi:
Heavyrain, you're a good child.

Abi:
You protect your comrades, care for your friends, even watch out for my useless old ass.

Abi:
I'm so... very happy.

Heavyrain:
Stop it...

Abi:
*cough* *cough*... If you're willing to see everyone as a comrade, to help them, to lay your personal grudges to rest...

Abi:
Then you're so much stronger than us elderly morons... but still... *cough* *cough*...

Abi:
Never let yourself be so easily bound. Be firm in your own steps.

Abi:
You're a good child, I trust that.

Abi:
But there are times, when kindness is a little inappropriate, that's all.

Heavyrain:
I know.

Heavyrain:
I know...

Heavyrain:
Abi...

Abi:
Don't let it weigh you down. Whatever else, we need someone left to bring our letters back.

Abi:
After so long away, it's about time we old men... went home.

Abi:
These tags––these comrades... you protect them well. I believe in you...

Abi:
Bring... *cough* *cough*... everyone...

Heavyrain:
(Abi!!!!) !!!

Heavyrain:
No! Abi!

Anum:
Dammit... Heavyrain...

Sargonian Janissary:
Move aside! Everyone move aside!

Sargonian Janissary:
Any more fighting, and you'll all be executed on the spot!

Heavyrain:
Stay away from Anum, or I'll take you on myself!

Heavyrain:
Don't be scared, Anum!

Anum:
Mm...

Sargonian Janissary:
Enough! Do you not think your crimes are sufficiently grave yet?

Sargonian Janissary:
Unit 0374! You have betrayed the lord ameer, and spurned your soldier's oath.

Sargonian Janissary:
This is your last chance to wash yourselves of guilt!

Sargonian Janissary:
We hope for you to prove your loyalty through your actions in this assignment.

Anum:
*sigh*... And here I thought we might have a chance to live.

Anum:
I should have expected that the lord ameer was never going to let us go.

Anum:
Now what?

Heavyrain:
Don't be afraid.

Heavyrain:
Nobody is allowed to hurt you, no matter who it is.

Anum:
......

Heavyrain:
(Abi...)

Heavyrain:
(I'll bring everyone home, together.)
