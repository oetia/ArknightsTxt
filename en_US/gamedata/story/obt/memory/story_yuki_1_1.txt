Fumizuki:
Yuki-chan.

Shirayuki:
Here.

Fumizuki:
I've informed Yenwu. Now, I've arranged for you to enter a pharmaceutical company called Rhodes Island as an operator.

Shirayuki:
Rhodes Island?

Fumizuki:
Yes. You've likely already heard of it.

Shirayuki:
Only that the Miss has deep ties with them.

Shirayuki:
Does the Princess want me to protect the Miss?

Fumizuki:
Hm... that has been part of my intent. After all, this is an Infected organization. However, I believe Hui-chieh should be able to handle things herself.

Shirayuki:
Infected... does the Princess consider them reliable?

Fumizuki:
Yes. Be assured. I've met their leader before. She is quite a good girl.

Fumizuki:
And I've looked into things a little. I feel the company itself is good too. So, I feel this is a good opportunity.

Shirayuki:
Opportunity?

Fumizuki:
Yes. You've followed me since childhood. Even now in Lungmen, you haven't once left my side.

Shirayuki:
It is my mission.

Fumizuki:
But you also ought to see the sights outside.

Shirayuki:
I need only to know what sights the Princess sees.

Fumizuki:
This is an order, Yuki-chan.

Shirayuki:
...Understood.

Shirayuki:
I am Shirayuki. Princess Fumizuki told me to assist Madam Ch'en and follow all your orders.

Shirayuki:
......

Shirayuki:
......

Shirayuki:
......

Shirayuki:
......

Shirayuki:
......

Shirayuki:
Several days' observation. The Doctor, a strange sort.

Shirayuki:
Directly heats instant food in mouth with kettle. Genius.

Shirayuki:
But holds true requisite ability, in command of people and handling of sundry affairs.

Shirayuki:
Further, Rhodes Island. More than meets the eye.

Shirayuki:
Surface-level, a pharmaceutical company. In reality, close to a military organization. With fair strength. No surprise Lord Wei would cooperate with this company.

Shirayuki:
The Princess spoke it not forth, but as Miss Ch'en is here, I am presumably willed to investigate this organization, and protect the Miss in full.

Shirayuki:
Doctor aside, two others are leaders here.

Shirayuki:
Amiya, I have met. In the Princess's words, a very kindly person.

Shirayuki:
But as she has proven a leader, exceptionality must reside. Cannot be taken lightly.

Shirayuki:
The other, a Kal'tsit, not yet met. From others' conversation, the true core figure of this company. Further understanding of her required.

Shirayuki:
Rough structure of accessible ship interior area committed to memory. Time, one in the morning. I shall move out.

Shirayuki:
Entered.

Shirayuki:
Rhodes Island's pipeline design, adequate.

Shirayuki:
Ordered systematically, omnidirectional... and correspondingly monitored.

Shirayuki:
But such levels, a mere trifle.

Shirayuki:
Most passages are connected with dormitories via toilets. Only some windows give sight of what happens within dormitories, due to planning... Fair.

???:
Hwaaah... Gummy, I wanna eat meat...

Shirayuki:
Ceobe.

Shirayuki:
Abysmal sleeping posture.

Midnight:
Phew... Wonderful. That's enough training today to hit standards.

Midnight:
It's late now. Though there are no missions tomorrow, I should quickly do my skincare, and then it's beddy-byes.

Midnight:
Ah. Ever since I became an Operator, I haven't been properly managing my appearance.

Midnight:
But what can you do? Some things are a necessary sacrifice.

Midnight:
And I suppose even if I don't take care, I'm handsome enough as is.

Shirayuki:
(Shudder)

Shirayuki:
Operator codename, Midnight.

Shirayuki:
Narcissist.

Shirayuki:
Yet, ample muscle definition.

Dobermann:
Hm? Is it already this late?

Dobermann:
Whatever. Just a bit longer. I'm almost done drawing up the training program for Kroos's group.

Dobermann:
Kids really mature fast, don't they? You wouldn't recognize them now compared to when they just arrived at Rhodes Island.

Dobermann:
Heh. Though they're still a mile from where I want them to be.

Shirayuki:
Instructor Dobermann.

Shirayuki:
Steel-cold, heart of gold.

Shirayuki:
Most have already fallen asleep.

Shirayuki:
Rhodes Island's people by and large, seem used to life here.

Shirayuki:
Just as the Princess's words, a good place.

Shirayuki:
Ahead leaves the dormitory area. Tread carefully.

Rosa:
*Pant*... *pant*...

Zima:
Natalya... uh, should be calling you Rosa now. About time you call it.

Rosa:
Phew... You go to bed first. I'll do a little more training by myself.

Zima:
...Fine. You've got me for a while longer.

Zima:
I let you live. Think how bad I'd look if you just went and bit it on the battlefield.

Rosa:
Aha. If I could trouble you, then.

Shirayuki:
Two students from Ursus. Seemingly, refugees admitted prior.

Shirayuki:
Chernobog. A tragedy.

Shirayuki:
I wish you good luck.

Shirayuki:
Hm? That...

Kal'tsit:
Amiya, we'll conclude our work for today here.

Amiya:
Alright, Dr. Kal'tsit.

Amiya:
I'm not sure if the Doctor's asleep yet. I'll go and take a quick look.

Kal'tsit:
Dr. {@nickname} possesses a peculiar set of norms.

Amiya:
That might be true, but the Doctor's wellbeing is also very important!

Amiya:
I'll turn in after I've checked on the Doctor. Is that alright, Dr. Kal'tsit?

Kal'tsit:
...Suit yourself.

Amiya:
Mm-hm!

Shirayuki:
So this should be Dr. Kal'tsit...

Kal'tsit:
......

Shirayuki:
Her gaze, as though it flickered hither! Have I been found?!

Kal'tsit:
......

Shirayuki:
(Seemingly, she has not noticed me. Yet that sensation, it was...)

Shirayuki:
Forget it. As I am not found, I shall proceed.

Shirayuki:
(Hm? Ahead, an impression of great noise... surmising from direction, likely the Engineering Department.)

Closure:
Wait wait wait! No way! You're meant to kiss right freaking here, aren't you?! What are you hesitating for?! You're the heroine!

Closure:
Ugh, come on, one of these scenes is enough! Don't do it every time! What's your PROBLEM, scriptwriter?!

Closure:
Euuugh, I haaate this kind of development... How are they on their seventh season by now? And the reviews get crappier each time.

Closure:
They're just dragging it out! That's all they're doing!

Closure:
...Dammit, but that boy's so hot. And he's in every episode!

Closure:
Fine. I'll hang in there. Can't say it won't get better!

Shirayuki:
Chief Engineer Closure.

Shirayuki:
'Tis alleged that the Rhodes Island ship was her plan alone. Fearsome.

Shirayuki:
Yet this is not where the show's true ruin lies. The fourth season's spontaneous introduction of the supporting man; such was a nightmare.

Closure:
What? You're kidding me?! I thought this was bad enough!

Shirayuki:
...You catch upon my words?!

Closure:
Oh, shoot, I knee-jerked that one out.

Closure:
Whatever, come down here.

Shirayuki:
......

Shirayuki:
...Since when?

Closure:
The start.

Shirayuki:
......

Closure:
Oh, don't get me wrong, your ninja techniques are real amazing stuff. Thing is, I just knew you were gonna do this from the start.

Shirayuki:
...'Twas my individual action, untied to anyone.

Closure:
Alright, alright, loosen up. You think I'm treating you as a spy here or something?

Closure:
Princess Fumizuki specially phoned up Amiya when she sent you over.

Shirayuki:
......?

Closure:
When she did, she told Amiya, even if she had no ulterior motive sending you here, she was worried you might go a little overboard. So, she specifically warned us beforehand to keep our ears perked.

Closure:
And she gave Amiya a couple details on your MO, so I've been a little extra aware of you the past while.

Shirayuki:
...This has naught to do with the Princess.

Closure:
Jeez, you are some tough customer.

Closure:
Y'know, now I get the feeling I can't really talk you over.

Closure:
But if we actually treated you like a spy, wouldn't Kal'tsit have just dealt with you back there?

Shirayuki:
......

Closure:
Basically, seeing as this is your first offense, don't you worry that anyone's gonna punish you, or that it'll reflect badly on your Princess.

Closure:
But I don't recommend you try prowling around Rhodes Island like that again.

Closure:
On the one hand, you'd absolutely, aaaaaabsolutely never get into the core. At least, the pipes won't let you.

Closure:
But on the other hand, snooping into other people's privacy isn't super cool.

Closure:
And don't you get tired doing that?

Shirayuki:
I do not.

Shirayuki:
I will not repeat this.

Closure:
And you're gonna go find some other way instead, aren't you?

Shirayuki:
...I make no guarantee.

Closure:
Wowie, do I wanna let Kal'tsit sic you. Loyal people are such a pain in the neck, honestly.

Closure:
But whatever, Kal'tsit wanted me to tell you this instead. 'You may use your methods to observe Rhodes Island, but Rhodes Island is observing you too.'

Shirayuki:
...I understand.

Closure:
Hey, honestly, if you're so bored at night you wanna roam around, you can come watch these stories with me.

Closure:
You gave me the impression you've done a little research into them. Most of Rhodes Island are all outdoorsy types, and I'm starving for any compatriots of my own. It's killing me, c'mon.

Shirayuki:
In continuing to watch this, you will truly find no value.

Shirayuki:
I may recommend some. I know not if you possess them.

Closure:
Alright, alright!

Closure:
Lay 'em on me, and if I don't have them, I'll go find them for us to watch together!

Shirayuki:
...Very well.
