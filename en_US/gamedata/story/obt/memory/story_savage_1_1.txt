Iron Carrot City Exterior Mining Site, Mineshaft #26

Rim Billiton Worker:
Tough shift, Johnny. Done down there?

Johnny:
Phew.

Johnny:
I'm buggered. Pull me up.

Rim Billiton Worker:
Er, I'm in all clean clothes...

Johnny:
What's your problem, eh? You're going under next, aren'tcha?

Johnny:
What did you need me for?

Rim Billiton Worker:
Security inspector's here. Come to ask the state of things down below.

Johnny:
What state of things? When's any shift I've led all these years had a slip-up?

Johnny:
Send ol' Inspeccy to talk with the next shift leader.

Johnny:
I'm having myself a nice bath. If the Security cohort want to wait for me, they can wait patient.

Johnny:
...Oh, there's a surprise.

Johnny:
If it isn't our girl. Back from that long trip of yours?

Savage:
Been an age, you boneheaded oldie.

Savage:
And what do you mean, long trip...? I'm doing proper work, you know.

Johnny:
Lighten up, now. I know, you're posted over at Babel, doing big things just all the livelong day.

Johnny:
Seen plenty of the world these two years, haven'tcha?

Savage:
Nothing all that scary... tagging along around different places, that's all.

Savage:
And I mean, my work didn't even touch on any core details.

Johnny:
Hmph. Get a load of you. Finally knowing to come back.

Johnny:
Don't know if it was something upstairs or at Babel, but they were getting along just fine, and then suddenly, there they are, over 'cause they say it's over.

Savage:
Frankly, I haven't got the first clue either.

Johnny:
Forget it. Been back home yet?

Savage:
Already told them I'm sound.

Johnny:
When'd you get back?

Savage:
Three days ago...

Johnny:
Hmph. You know, all your pals in Sec from before got promoted, and here you are now dancing back under their fingers.

Johnny:
Why so eager for the job here? Everything with Babel all sorted, then?

Savage:
I...

Savage:
......

Johnny:
I'd guess the world's on your shoulders, looking like that.

Johnny:
Not here to play 20 Questions on ya, just say what I wanted and be done.

Johnny:
But it's a hard thing to do, getting back home to see your old mates. Still not happy?

Savage:
I don't... know, myself.

Savage:
Of course I missed you all, and I mean, I know my hometown mines like nothing else.

Savage:
But...

Savage:
I just feel—things wrapped up too fast.

Johnny:
(Whistle) Look at you. Who says you didn't land a good assignment?

Johnny:
Or was it some sweetheart you found that you just can't bear to leave?

Savage:
Wh—What sweetheart—just a friend, okay!

Savage:
Ugh... besides, I didn't do anything praiseworthy either.

Johnny:
No, I heard you picked up a big job. Digging those 'goods' out one after another's cost two years of our time.

Johnny:
All the workers reckon it has to be something happened outside.

Savage:
Lots of engineering going on. But I'm only on the bog-standard stuff.

Savage:
Cooperation this time was to make sure the 'goods' going from Rim Billiton to Babel had a safe journey and made it without hassle. They needed a security crew to see it through.

Savage:
And just like that, the hull and core our mining firm dug up gets sent straight to Babel.

Savage:
I had some security work to do with them. That's it.

Johnny:
So you're saying you really don't know a damn thing?

Savage:
(Bitter chuckle) John, you know me, don't you...

Johnny:
Old girl... *sigh* Still same as ever, then, making a complete mess of it when the moment comes.

Johnny:
Not complaining, though. Let the Sarkaz sort out their own biz! Maybe it's a good thing they muddled it up when it mattered.

Johnny:
But if Babel wasn't there to rope you in, would you have any other reason?

Savage:
I used to be so sure, you know, I'd live my whole life in the mines.

Savage:
Didn't need to mind what happens outside. Could say I knew nothing about it.

Johnny:
That was your chance to take a gander out there, wasn't it? When you left Rim Billiton.

Johnny:
I still remember, when you were just off, you were howling how you didn't wanna go. That's the thing, youngsters, y'know...

Savage:
Ha, haha...

Savage:
Johnny, I... got to know a kid like me.

Savage:
You know how hard it is, with the Sarkaz life all around you, trying to grow up healthy.

Savage:
But she chose to take it on. She learned to endure, to persevere, and kept hope in her heart all along.

Savage:
So much more she still needs to know and learn. She was always wrapped around me, asking me all sorts of questions.

Savage:
She likes the food I make, and she's especially interested in Rim Billiton's fables.

Johnny:
A little rabbit. Where'd she come from?

Savage:
Rim Billiton. But... she isn't gonna come back. So...

Savage:
Honestly, I don't know either, why it is I'm worrying so much.

Johnny:
Hmph, now isn't that easy—

Johnny:
You want to protect her.

Savage:
Yes.

Savage:
I do. I do wanna protect her.

Savage:
But now's not the time. I've got no reason to stay there, and none of the skill to guide her forward.

Savage:
I knew. I should come back to Rim Billiton, is what I should do.

Johnny:
Seems like you've already found your calling, then, haven'tcha?

Savage:
It's not all that big a thing. After all, if I insisted on staying at Babel, other people wouldn't wanna hire me, and then I'd be out of a job, poor me! Haha...

Johnny:
You utter case, you...

Johnny:
Forget it, just do what you've gotta do now!

Johnny:
Keeping us safe in the mines is all up to you Security lot.

Johnny:
Especially you. Seeing you'll give your mates plenty peace of mind.

Johnny:
At least for now, we need you.

Savage:
Right. I understand.

Savage:
Odd of you, Johnny. Got a lot to say today, ain'tcha?

Johnny:
Hmph, you're a special case. You've seen the world out there, now. Can't go around putting on airs anymore.

Savage:
Haha, don't joke like that—

Johnny:
So?

Johnny:
Can't have forgotten our traditional Cautus virtues, coming all the way back from out yonder?

Savage:
Huh? What virtues?

Johnny:
You little girlie... prezzies, of course it's prezzies, to mark the occasion!

Johnny:
I've got no basis to leave Rim Billiton, no way to go out and see the sights. You youngsters, forgetting all about me the moment the chance for it lands in your lap...

Savage:
Haha, I'm having you on. How could I forget?

Savage:
I didn't know if I'd have another chance to leave after I came back, so I made sure to buy whole trunks of stuff, and brought it back myself.

Savage:
Here. A top-of-the-line hearing aid I picked up in Victoria, just for you.

Johnny:
Now that's more like it. All those shifts I had with you paid off.

Johnny:
I'll be able to pick out what the kids are saying so much easier with this. Urgh, ruddy condition. Ruddy job.

Savage:
Alright, alright. I'll head down to inspect, then.

Savage:
Hah, there's a familiar feeling.

Savage:
Protective clothing so stuffy you choke, stiff and heavy worker's cap, can't wipe off your sweat even if you wanted to.

Savage:
Mining away in tough conditions like these, risking your life with Originium for company.

Savage:
My people's lives, all spent upon these mines going dirtier and deeper.

Savage:
—This used to be my whole life, my everything. Just like the rest of us.

Savage:
Is this how I'm gonna spend my future, same as the past?

Savage:
Stoppit, stoppit, there's no point thinking so hard. I have to work properly, at the least... The safety, the lives of workers like Johnny are on my back, now.

Savage:
......

Savage:
But... I just can't help wondering...

Two years later

1:34 P.M. \ Blistering heat

Iron Carrot City Exterior Mining Site, Mineshafts #27, #28, #29

Rim Billiton Worker:
Out—Get out!

Rim Billiton Worker:
The dust's about to explode—

Rim Billiton Worker:
Ugh—gaah—!

Rim Billiton Worker:
Save m—*cough*, *cough*—

Johnny:
Calm down! All of you, oxygen tanks on!

Rim Billiton Worker:
Help—save me, for—

......

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
What's the alarm sounding for?

Savage:
It's a serious danger alert... something's happened in the mines!

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Report!

Rim Billiton Worker:
I-It's gone to hell, Mineshafts #27, #28, #29 have all had active Originium dust explosions!

Savage:
What?

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Tch...! I SAID we couldn't start work in this bloody weather!

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Bloody anything for that bit of output—

Savage:
Shaft #29... that's...!

Savage:
Any casualties among personnel? What's the state of the site?

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
There—There are workers buried in the collapse! Confirmed, there are wounded!

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Strewth! Savage!

Savage:
Understood!

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Right.

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Get rescuing. I'll lock down the accident site.

Savage:
—Get your protective gear on, and follow me!

Savage:
Haah, haah...

Savage:
Dig, dig... gotcha!

Savage:
Are you still alive, oldie, are you still there?!

Savage:
—Johnny!

Savage:
Hold on! Grab my hand!

Johnny:
*cough*...!

Johnny:
Hurts... like hell...

Savage:
Hang in there, Johnny, we can get you!

Savage:
Pull him out, quick!

Savage:
Stay with me, Johnny! No sleeping now!

Rim Billiton Worker:
Savage, we're 300m from the medic tent!

Savage:
Rush him!

Rim Billiton Worker:
Got it!

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Hello, we're the joint emergency medical group assigned to this mining incident.

Savage:
Rim Billiton PLC Security Group, haah, haah... wounded...!

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Understood. We'll find a bed for them immediately.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Could you register some information with us for now? We need to contact next of kin immediately...

Savage:
The company will sort that out straight away! Just start treating him first!

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Huh?

Savage:
Thomas, you stay behind to register and get set up with the branch.

Rim Billiton Worker:
Got it!

Savage:
Everyone else, with me! There's still wounded we haven't rescued.

Rim Billiton Worker:
Got it!

Savage:
Right, you're...

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
My coworkers and I form a volunteer emergency aid group for this incident. We're from Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Savage:
(Rhodes Island? I haven't heard of that company...)

Savage:
Alright, Rhodes Island. I'll... leave the oldie to you, then.

Savage:
Please, you have to save him.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
We'll do what we can.

Savage:
Ngh... quick, let's get the next one out!

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Good work, Savage.

Savage:
All accounted for?

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Hardly believe it. We even found all the bodies. Twelve wounded, three critically, and the dead...

Savage:
That's enough.

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Even if I didn't tell, nobody'd know it better than you.

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Judging by the concentration of Originium dust at the scene, the injured are all in big trouble...

Savage:
......

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Where are you going?

Savage:
Aid post. I'm going to see the old man.

Savage:
Right. There were a few medics out of the aid volunteers who came from 'Rhodes Island.' You heard of that organization before, chief?

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Rhodes Island...? Doesn't ring a bell. Bet it's a fresh new company.

Rim Billiton Security Chief:
Get going. Good chance to inspect while you're there. See what this Rhodes Island is here for.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Hello, can I ask who you...

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Ah, you're the one from the Security team! You carried the first of the wounded over, too.

Savage:
Just call me Savage. I'm here to see how they're doing.

Savage:
One of the casualties just now... should be registered as 'John.'

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Mister John, is it? Please be assured, our Medic Operators have already administered emergency treatment to him.

Savage:
Is... How are his injuries?

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Right. Originium crystals penetrated to his arm and the flank of his abdomen. This ruptured his protective gear, and the amount of Originium particulate he inhaled afterwards also...

Savage:
So, he's already been infected for sure, hasn't he?

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Y... Yes.

Savage:
Damn it. Too slow.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
However, we've made use of Rhodes Island injective medication in the treatment already given to Mister John, and that's prevented any further progression of infection.

Savage:
What...? But, with injuries that bad, and wounds directly from active Originium crystals...

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
I do understand your concern, Miss.

Savage:
Just... call me Savage. You said your drug injection stopped the spread? Is that true?

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Yes, Miss Savage. All the personnel carried in so far have been administered emergency medication in accordance with their level of injury and severity of infection.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Some patients are not out of danger yet due to their overly severe blood loss, but their Originium infection symptoms have been fundamentally suppressed.

Savage:
All suppressed?

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Yes, every one... Do you have any issues?

Savage:
No. Thing is, even if the drug works some wonders, it's not something you can give to workers straight away.

Savage:
Rim Billiton's extant medical orgs all use cheap Originium infection meds, and they only do so little for workers who're already infected.

Savage:
But then Rhodes Island...

Savage:
You're a volunteer aid group, aren'tcha? These emergency meds aren't cheap, and the doses are pretty staggering. You all...

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Er, I—I'm not responsible for any of that at all...

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
But, I can promise you, Mister John's already out of mortal danger. He'll be able to receive visitors before long.

Savage:
It's not the same... Once they're Infected, workers' fates are already sealed.

Savage:
They're forced into even cheaper labor, sent to the exhausted mineshafts for all the most brutal, dangerous work, collecting remainders.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
I'm sorry. When they arrived, most of the patients had already...

Savage:
No, I should be the one apologizing here. I'm sorry, you've already done so much and then some... thank you, a million times.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Miss Savage, I... I understand your feelings.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Director Kal'tsit once instructed us that no matter how many wounds we heal, how much Oripathy we suppress...

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Once you've become Infected, no matter how unreasonable it is, most of society has already turned against you.

Savage:
That's right. Kal'tsit told you some...

Savage:
......

Savage:
Huh?

Savage:
Who did you—just say your director was?

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Kal'tsit. She's an example to all our Medic Operators at Rhodes Island.

Savage:
Director... Kal'tsit...

Savage:
Don't tell me...!

Savage:
Who—Who's your leader? At Rhodes Island—What's the name of your leader at this Rhodes Island place?

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
She's, um...

Savage:
Tell me. Please, I need to know.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
She's called...

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Our leader's, Rhodes Island's current leader's name is—

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
'Amiya.'

Savage:
...A... miya...

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Excuse me, is there a problem?

Savage:
How is it Amiya...? If it really is her, she shouldn't be much older right now than—

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Mm-hm, yes, our leader is considerably young.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
But... you'll know once you talk to her, even once. She has wisdom beyond her years and a strong will. She's a truly outstanding leader.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Miss Savage, might you know some... Are you an old acquaintance of Amiya's, possibly?

Savage:
Ah... um, we... were good friends since long ago.

Savage:
Can you... Can you get in contact with Amiya? Just say my name, and she'll know.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
I see. Amiya did mention she had a very close friend who might be here in Rim Billiton now...

Savage:
It... It really is Amiya... Can I go see her? How?

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
I'll get in touch with Rhodes Island's Messengers now. Also, Miss Savage, if you have anything you'd like us to relay to her...

Fifteen days later

Iron Carrot City Outskirts, Aid Station, in the Infected Ward

Johnny:
The moment I realized I was Infected, I even thought, maybe my family would've been much better off if I'd just carked it and they got the compensation money.

Savage:
Don't say that.

Johnny:
Just a thought I had... *sigh*.

Johnny:
The very first thing that came to mind, d'ya know, was I asked myself, how the hell should I face my family now?

Johnny:
My better half and the kids don't like it when I'm angry, and they hate it even more when they see me cry.

Johnny:
But when it's time to meet them, am I really gonna be able to smile?

Savage:
This is nothing like you, you oldie.

Savage:
Everyone knows you as the most hopeful guy for miles around.

Savage:
When even you're seeing family with your ears drooped down, how're the rest of your mates meant to meet anyone?

Rim Billiton Worker:
Yeah, you're right!

Rim Billiton Worker:
You're gonna spoil all our moods like that acting miserable, Johnny!

Johnny:
Hmph. You don't have a bunch of tykes to feed. You don't know the pain of it. Life's a bastard one.

Rim Billiton Worker:
We're all gonna have some bloody awful days too—

Johnny:
Hey, Savage. Don't listen to another word from them.

Johnny:
I've already decided. Pay'll be nowhere near enough to feed my family if I keep working at Rim Billiton.

Johnny:
Once the sickness lifts a little, we'll be off to Columbia, simple as that. All of us are heading to be part of the 'Great Expansion.'

Savage:
John... you're really about to leave?

Johnny:
When I was a miner for Rim Billiton, I was the most diligent, hardworking worker, bar none.

Johnny:
Now, I'm an Infected, and no matter how long I've still got left, I have to keep everyone at home living safely. Living happily.

Savage:
Has it ever come to mind, so long as Rim Billiton's not done digging by the end of the day, this back-and-forth life's just gonna...

Johnny:
Savage.

Johnny:
Every person, every age, has callings and responsibilities to answer.

Johnny:
I've never once been ashamed of being a mineworker. Nobody in Rim Billiton'd ever think that.

Johnny:
But, you see, Savage, you left Rim Billiton, been back two years, and your thinking changed.

Savage:
Yeah...

Johnny:
I knew you'd be no ordinary rabbit, ever since you were a nipper. Every last person has their own calling, and their own responsibilities.

Johnny:
Your hammer's saved our lives. In the days to come, you'll be saving countless more.

Johnny:
If there's someone you need to protect, then leave, eh. It's the same for me.

Savage:
......

Johnny:
......

Johnny:
Heh, peek at the face you're making. Looks like you made your mind up long ago, didn'tcha?

Savage:
Hey, I'm not some emotionless robot, you oldie.

Savage:
It's just, this is something I've gotta go do.

Savage:
I have a friend I need to protect.

Savage:
Finally... I've found her again. I can see her again.

Savage:
Even if it's just the slightest thing, for her, I'll give every last bit of strength I have.

Johnny:
Hmph. There's nothing out there worth giving 'every last bit.' That's just you youngsters being too naive.

Savage:
Haha... I mean, going into the mines for your family, and coming back out now for them, you said that, didn'tcha? You're using all your strength, giving it all you have too, right?

Johnny:
Who says I'm like you? I'm trying to feed a family here!

Savage:
Alright, alright.

Johnny:
Hmph...

Johnny:
When're you looking to head out?

Savage:
Today. Came to see you for the last time, and then I'll be setting off.

Johnny:
It's been by your help we didn't have one accident these past two years.

Johnny:
And this one, well, it was you again who pulled us out alive... can't thank you enough.

Savage:
Well, you've got me put on a pedestal.

Savage:
John, you need to cherish the life I saved, and make sure you live the coming days well, alright?

Johnny:
You rotten little girl.

Johnny:
See you.

Savage:
See you too. Johnny.

Savage:
(It'll be goodbye for now, Rim Billiton.)

Savage:
Sorry, I've been keeping you.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Miss Savage, are you already done with all your goodbyes?

Savage:
Seriously, John... told me right at the end, I should head back home again and give them a proper farewell.

Savage:
Yesterday when I said goodbye to my mum and dad, my mum was going on about 'next time you come back, you'll have a special someone.'

Savage:
This is for my career here!

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Hah, haha.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
All of you are such a happy group.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
I've linked up with the landship, and the expedited onboard application's all gone through. These papers are a recruitment contract from HR.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Detailed work matters should be handed over once we reach the landship, Miss Savage. Rhodes Island very much welcomes your arrival.

Rhodes Island Medic Operator:
Well then... Miss Savage, have a good journey.

Savage:
Finally, finally.

Savage:
I've found it.

Savage:
Amiya, what are you like now?

Savage:
You've already grown into a leader. That's incredible.

Savage:
Wait for me, Amiya. No matter what happens, no matter what calling you're shouldering.

Savage:
I've got a lot I want to tell you, a lot of stories I want to share. Will you want to hear them?

Savage:
All the good and the bad that you've been through, all the good and the bad I've been through, in all these two years—

Savage:
Once we meet, let's tell each other all we want.
