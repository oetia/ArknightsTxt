Medic Operator:
Over here! I see him.

Caster Operator:
Coming, coming.

Aosta:
Hello.

Aosta:
It's done. Have a look.

Medic Operator:
Wow...

Caster Operator:
Did you really make this?

Medic Operator:
I didn't expect it to be so fast. It's so cute!

Aosta:
I had inspiration when making it, so it took less time than I thought. Any part you'd like to change?

Medic Operator:
None whatsoever. It's exactly how I imagined it!

Medic Operator:
Here's the payment. And have some cookies too—we made them a couple of days ago in the kitchen.

Aosta:
Cookies? Thanks.

Medic Operator:
The more I look at it, the more I like it. The collar padding's so nice! Soft and cushy.

Aosta:
I tried a few materials, but this was the softest.

Aosta:
Picking the right one took quite a bit of time.

Medic Operator:
Did you make it in the dorms? The materials took up a lot of space, didn't they? I remember getting my head chewed off for taking up too much of the shared space when I was obsessed with toy blocks.

Medic Operator:
Are your roommates okay with this? I wouldn't want to cause you any trouble.

Aosta:
No problem, they know about my hobby.

Medic Operator:
Operator Bibeak submitted an application for a sewing room. Maybe you can talk to the Logistics Department too, so that you don't have to keep everything piled up in your dorm.

Medic Operator:
Or even open a stall on the ship!

Medic Operator:
Bibeak only makes clothes for the people she chooses, while Orchid specializes in coordinating outfits. You'd corner the market if you opened up a stall!

Aosta:
......

Caster Operator:
From the look on your face, you haven't talked to them yet?

Aosta:
Yeah... Chiave may have recommended me to you, but I've never really thought about making clothes and accessories for anyone else.

Aosta:
I've never even heard of the two operators you just mentioned.

Caster Operator:
Well, Bibeak and Orchid are easy to get along with. I'm sure there wouldn't be a problem if you wanted to chat with them.

Caster Operator:
Oh look, that was Bibeak just now!

Bibeak:
Huh?

Bibeak:
Did someone say my name?

Aosta:
Oh, er, excuse me.

Bibeak:
This is my storeroom.

Bibeak:
I also invited Orchid today, to teach the other operators design. Feel free to share your sewing knowledge too, if you like.

Aosta:
I only came because I had a few questions for you. Not sure how much I can teach.

Bibeak:
It's fine. I don't really know enough to teach others either; I just wanted other people to talk about sewing with. Thanks for coming anyway!

Orchid:
Bibeak? I'm here.

Bibeak:
Orchid!

Orchid:
Who's this?

Aosta:
Hello ma'am, my name is Aosta. I'll be joining the lessons today.

Orchid:
No need to be so polite. Hard to believe there are still well-mannered kids like you on Rhodes Island... Oh.

Serious Operator:
What a relief. I thought I'd be the only male operator here.

Orchid:
Sorry, did I keep everyone waiting? I brought some snacks for break time.

Bibeak:
Thank you. Now let's get started!

Hushed but excited discussion fills the storeroom, as everyone inside is drawn into the world of sewing.

Aosta:
......

Aosta:
(I'm not sure I should ask now.)

Aosta:
(Seems like they all know each other. Should I try to join the conversation?)

Aosta:
(Bibeak and Orchid... Originium crystals... Oh.)

Aosta:
(They have Oripathy too...)

Aosta:
(But they look so happy. Is it because they found a hobby they love?)

Aosta:
(...This storeroom's filled with Bibeak's materials. No wonder that operator suggested that I apply.)

Aosta:
......

Aosta:
Hm...

Serious Operator:
Excuse me, do you know how to knit this kind of yarn pouch? It's supposed to be a gift, but I just can't get the hang of it.

Serious Operator:
The others are all busy right now, so I thought I'd ask you.

Bibeak and Orchid look completely immersed in their conversations.

Aosta:
Alright, let me have a look.

Aosta:
You mean the one in this picture, right?

Aosta:
I see... it's a rather complicated pattern. Doing this on the right worktable would make things so much easier...

Serious Operator:
Something like this?

Aosta:
Yes. Let me try it out and see if I'm on the right track. Give me a minute.

Serious Operator:
Sure, thanks.

Aosta:
...Maybe this kind of yarn would give it a better sheen.

Serious Operator:
Yeah, the colors look warmer under the light. I think she'll like it.

Aosta:
...Stringing a few beads here will make it look—I'm not sure how to put this, but more elaborate?

Serious Operator:
Let me see...

Serious Operator:
Wow. Your name's Aosta, right? Do you take orders?

Aosta:
Huh? Yeah, I suppose. What do you ne—

Serious Operator:
Hey, did you rip your sleeve?

Serious Operator:
There's a nail sticking out here. I guess it got caught on it.

Aosta:
It's fine. Nothing a little needlework can't fix.

Aosta:
Excuse me. Where are the needles?

Orchid:
Behind you, in the drawers... third from the top? Or was it the fourth?

Bibeak:
Do you need any thread too? And I have more materials in the box. Help yourself.

Aosta:
Thanks, just the needle and thread should be fine.

Aosta:
......

Orchid:
Oh, you're mending your own clothes?

Bibeak:
It can't be easy to sew while you're still wearing it.

Bibeak:
How about you take off your jacket? We have plenty of materials here. You can use this table.

Aosta:
Come on, let me fix that hole up.

Aosta:
Where's the thread? There's a spool here... is this white or black? Did you have a mud-throwing party in here or what?

Chiave:
Hm... patterned? Not sure. Who cares, as long as it works!

Broca:
Don't forget we still need some new fabric to make more clothes after this.

Aosta:
And we can't cheap out on it either. I learned my lesson last year.

Chiave:
That dye was awful. Gave me rashes for days.

Broca:
That's why you need to wash it a few times before wearing it.

Aosta:
Oh, I've always done it like this.

Aosta:
This cloth is really durable. Just stitch it up a little, and it's good for a while.

Serious Operator:
But you used the good stuff when you knitted that yarn pouch for me.

Aosta:
That's because I was doing it for you.

Aosta:
When it's a job, I want to do it right. But my own clothes are made from durable materials, with thick threads that are made to last—

Aosta:
Oh?

Serious Operator:
What's the matter?

Serious Operator:
Oh, it looks like you also got a scratch on your elbow from that nail. You didn't feel it?

Aosta:
Just a little scrape. It's not bleeding anymore, I'll just wipe it down.

Orchid:
A scratch? Let me see... yes. I always bring a few band-aids with me, because you never know when they'll come in handy.

Orchid:
Let me see your elbow. I have a first-aid kit with me too... Wait, why am I so used to this?

Orchid:
Never mind. Over here.

Aosta:
You don't need to—

Orchid:
We need to disinfect it.

Aosta:
...Yes, ma'am.

Bibeak:
Hehe.

Orchid:
Even a small scratch can be big problem if there's any rust on the nail and the wound's not properly disinfected.

Orchid:
...Oh? That expression looks familiar. Let me guess... you hardly think it's a wound at all, don't you?

Orchid:
Regardless of how you used to do things, you're on Rhodes Island now.

Orchid:
Make the most of your environment.

Aosta:
Hm... Looks good. Thanks.

Aosta:
I'll get back to work then.

Serious Operator:
I can handle the rest myself. I was watching you work, and it was supposed to be a gift from me anyway. It's not right for me to ask that of someone who just ripped their clothes AND their elbow.

Serious Operator:
I'm really grateful though. Tell you what, I'll buy you a new jacket the next time we're on a mission together!

Serious Operator:
Ever since I was little, I've always wanted to earn money so I could buy gifts for everyone who helped me out. And now you're one of them, my man!

Aosta:
......

Aosta:
There's something that I've been thinking about all day.

Chiave:
Lay it on me.

Aosta:
When you were little, did you ever think about what you wanted to be when you grew up?

Chiave:
Oh? Let me think... the head of the Famiglia, I guess?

Broca:
Can't say I have...

Aosta:
Well, for me...

Aosta:
Before I ever picked up a weapon, before my dad brought me along with him...

Aosta:
I wanted to be a public official, to live a quiet and peaceful life.

Bibeak:
Your needlework could be bolder, don't worry about ruining the cloth. It's the same for everyone at first, and even if you leave a hole there are ways to fix that.

Bibeak:
Put your ideas into action. Don't be afraid to fail.

Orchid:
You want to hide the Originium on your body? No problem, I can arrange things so no one sees it.

Orchid:
But lately I've been thinking, why should we have to hide it?

Bibeak:
I've thought about that too...

Aosta:
......

Aosta:
Let me finish this up.

Aosta:
(Oh, I wanted to chat with them.)

Aosta:
(...But now I don't feel like I need to?)

Aosta:
(I've never been able to figure this stuff out.)

Aosta:
Phew...

Serious Operator:
Aosta?

Aosta:
Oh, excuse me. I drifted off for a moment.

Aosta:
Once I'm done with this pouch, can you come help me pick out fabric to patch my jacket with?

Aosta:
I want to hear what you think.

Bibeak:
Sure.

Orchid:
So you've come around at last.

Serious Operator:
I'm coming too!

Aosta:
Thank you.

Perhaps this is the way of life he wanted. Perhaps he could seize it with his own hands.

Aosta:
They made me take all this fabric...

Aosta:
I should make something to thank them.

Aosta:
And what Bibeak said... she wants me to experiment more. She says she's glad she came out of her own shell...

Aosta:
Hm...

Chiave:
He—llo!!

Aosta:
Whoa?!

Chiave:
Hey, guess what I just did!

Aosta:
......

Aosta:
Not interested.

Chiave:
I blew them all away!

Chiave:
Hey, don't go!

Chiave:
Look at this! Look who won first place!

Chiave:
That's right, ME!

Chiave:
Winner of the 1st Rhodes Island cookie-eating contest, at 26 cookies! The undisputed champ!

Aosta:
......

Aosta:
There were people willing to play along with you? And you didn't get a royal beating from the cafeteria staff? Lucky bastard.

Chiave:
Hey, if I ate it, it's not going to waste.

Chiave:
So where's Broca?

Chiave:
I have to tell him what a killjoy you are!

Aosta:
Killjoy? Go brag to him, then. I'll be waiting for news of your victory to make the headlines of Rhodes Island Daily.

Chiave:
Then I'll—wait, we have a newspaper here?

Aosta:
Nope.

Aosta:
You could feature in the first issue.

Chiave:
......

Chiave:
I know you're making fun of me! I'm not THAT stupid!

Chiave:
Whatever. Is that Broca I just saw? See ya!

Chiave:
Hahaha, I'm the champion!

Aosta:
......

Chiave:
Hahaha, look at me! Look at this drawing I made!

Aosta:
What exactly is this?

Broca:
...Whoa.

Chiave:
Don't you see? It shows how I beat up the thugs of the Famiglia!

Aosta:
......

Chiave:
Oh, come on, you can laugh, you know. It's not like this is the first time we've had people on our tail. We can always shake 'em!

Chiave:
The car's right here. Stop overthinking it!

Aosta:
...Yeah.

Aosta:
......

Aosta:
Phew...

Aosta:
This place is... eerily safe.

Aosta holds the rolls of cloth samples in his hands. They're heavy, but warm and soft.

He looks towards Chiave, running off with his hair whipping around in the wind. In those strands of hair, Aosta sees true joy, not forced smiles.

Aosta steps forward.

Aosta:
I'll be your assistant today, Doctor.

Aosta:
What do you need of me?

Aosta:
Okay.

Aosta:
......

Aosta:
Doctor, can I have a DIY room on the ship?
