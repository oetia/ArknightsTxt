Ceobe:
Vulcan!

Ceobe:
*sniff* *sniff*

Ceobe:
I smell honey biscuits!

Vulcan:
Yes, I just baked some.

Ceobe:
Wow!

Ceobe:
One for Vulcan, one for me! One for Matterhorn, one for me! One for Lava, one for me...

Vulcan:
......

Engineering Operator A:
Here's another batch of weapons that need repairs, Vulcan.

Vulcan:
Go play by yourself for a while, Kay. I have some work to get to.

Ceobe:
Okay!

Engineering Operator A:
We've taken care of the ones that just need honing or oiling, but there are a few that are above our pay grade.

Vulcan:
Alright, I'll take a look at them.

Engineering Operator A:
It's been disassembled. Everything's here: Originium circuit, crossbow frame, and other miscellaneous parts.

Engineering Operator A:
Regular maintenance and testing are complete; the hard part's with a modification.

Engineering Operator A:
The user is a sniper, but he wants to add a built-in shield.

Vulcan:
Like the round shield I designed? It only protects the user, but it's portable and can be carried on the belt.

Vulcan:
The integrated Originium circuit can boost the user's Arts, or even be used as a weapon itself.

Engineering Operator A:
But adding it to a crossbow adds dead weight while compromising integrity. That's why I was thinking about rejecting the application.

Vulcan:
Don't worry, leave it to me.

Vulcan:
The recently developed elastic parts, as well as the ultra-thin ones developed by Blemishine, may come in useful.

Engineering Operator A:
We'll leave it to you then.

Vulcan:
There's a lot to do today...

Engineering Operator B:
We have a bunch of weapons coming in for repair and maintenance.

Vulcan:
Looks like they went through the grinder out there.

Vulcan:
Look at this crack. The user would've been severely injured without the shield there. See how many arrowheads got caught in it?

Engineering Operator B:
Here's Operator Matterhorn's shield too.

Engineering Operator B:
Talk about a deep crack... was he trying to dig a tunnel with it?

Vulcan:
Seems like it'll need to be replaced sooner rather than later.

Vulcan:
I'll disassemble it. Check the integrity of the individual parts.

Engineering Operator B:
......

Vulcan:
Is something the matter?

Engineering Operator B:
Oh, n-no, it's just that this is my first chance to work with you, so I'm a bit nervous...

Engineering Operator B:
The veterans of the Engineering Department talk about you a lot. I'll do my best!

Vulcan:
Well, good luck.

Vulcan:
I'll find some steel.

Vulcan:
Hibiscus's staff, Fang's lance, Beagle's shield, Kroos's crossbow...

Vulcan:
Their weapons have a tendency to take a beating.

Vulcan:
These are what they used when they first came to Rhodes Island. These are the ones that I've modified. Can you tell the difference?

Vulcan:
Rhodes Island operators have to work in a variety of environments, which demands a high degree of versatility from their equipment.

Engineering Operator B:
Understood!

Vulcan:
It's also important to take into account each operator's personality and individual needs. The craftsman's intentions must never supplant the user's needs.

Engineering Operator B:
Like the accessories that Kroos hangs here?

Vulcan:
Yes.

Vulcan:
Many operators are very attached to their weapons, and we must be extremely attentive to this in our work.

Vulcan:
The better we know the user, the better we can fulfill their requests.

Vulcan:
Alright, this batch of weapons is done.

Vulcan:
May they serve their operators well.

???:
Excuse me, Vulcan, are you there?

Vulcan:
Yes, come in. The door's unlocked.

Matterhorn:
Hello. I would like to commission a new shield.

Matterhorn:
This is the one that I've been using. It's gone through a lot of repairs, and it's getting less and less effective in combat. It's time I replaced it.

Vulcan:
This one? I've worked on it many times.

Matterhorn:
Yes, I brought it with me from Kjerag.

Matterhorn:
It was made with steel that could withstand the extremely low temperatures there.

Vulcan:
Away from Kjerag, however, it no longer performs at the same level.

Matterhorn:
Yes, you mentioned that before, but I didn't want to replace it.

Matterhorn:
With the crack from this latest operation, though, I can see that it's reached its limit.

Matterhorn:
We ran into a pack of enraged needleflies, and their poisons have seeped into the crack.

Matterhorn:
It's going to be difficult to clean out the poison and needlefly pieces in order to repair it.

Matterhorn:
Even a layman like me can see how complicated it is.

Matterhorn:
So... I guess this is the end of the road for this shield; there's no way to get it back to peak form.

Vulcan:
Let me see.

Vulcan:
Needlefly poisons, and pieces from their mouthparts... definitely a headache.

Vulcan:
The size of the crack has also warped the structure in the back.

Vulcan:
The internal cracks are visible to the naked eye... what on earth have you guys been doing?

Vulcan:
And this is after you were able to evade some blows, it looks like... Otherwise, the shield would have already shattered, by the looks of the bite marks.

Vulcan:
So what do you plan to do with it once you get a new one?

Vulcan:
Retired equipment is typically sent to storage, either to be used in training or dismantled into parts that can be reused.

Vulcan:
Those with special significance are stored separately, or returned to their owners.

Matterhorn:
I...

Matterhorn:
This shield was forged by the smiths of House Silverash, passed down to me from my grandfather to my father, both bodyguards to the family.

Matterhorn:
It's a symbol of our vow to give our lives in battle, a vow I took when I received it from my father.

Matterhorn:
It's also a symbol of my duty to protect Lady Ensia, as commanded by my lord.

Matterhorn:
That's why I really appreciate the efforts you've put towards repairing it.

Matterhorn:
But I fear there's been too much damage this time.

Matterhorn:
Perhaps it would be better to clean it up and keep it for remembrance, while we craft a new shield for battle.

Vulcan:
Making a new one is easy. We have the materials, the knowhow, and I have experience fixing your shield.

Vulcan:
But I want to ask you a question.

Vulcan:
If it could be fixed, and not just as good as new, but even better, would you rather have it as a keepsake, or continue to use it?

Matterhorn:
......

Vulcan:
Stop worrying about the how.

Vulcan:
You came here and told me the story behind it, what it means to you.

Vulcan:
I can tell you care a lot about it.

Matterhorn:
Caring won't fix a broken shield.

Vulcan:
You haven't even asked if I could fix it.

Matterhorn:
...That's impossible.

Vulcan:
I never said that.

Matterhorn:
But...

Vulcan:
Think it over. About what to give up on, and what to keep. Then you make your decision.

Vulcan:
That's what a lot of operators do when they come to me.

Vulcan:
Let's talk, Matterhorn.

Vulcan:
I spoke to a girl by the name of Rockrock. Do you know her? She's from Victoria, and she's only been here at HQ a few times, but she left a deep impression on me.

Matterhorn:
No... Why do you bring her up?

Vulcan:
She's an interesting girl. A little like myself.

Vulcan:
She was born in an old industrial district, and she feels strongly about everything there. She made everything on her herself.

Vulcan:
She liked my machines, but she insists on only using things she's made with her own hands.

Matterhorn:
...Like how you light the furnace and beat iron into ingots every day?

Vulcan:
Exactly.

Vulcan:
Is there any point to it? Not really.

Vulcan:
The machines here can create ingots faster than I can. Rockrock understands that what she makes isn't necessarily better than what's available on the market.

Matterhorn:
But you both insist on doing it anyway...

Vulcan:
Yes, because there's meaning behind it. It's part of my roots as a blacksmith.

Vulcan:
Rockrock insists on using what she made herself because, even though she doesn't reject the new, she feels that her roots are still in that old industrial district.

Vulcan:
As for you, no matter how comfortable you are at Rhodes Island, part of you will always be on the snow-covered mountains of Kjerag. You'll always remember the teachings of your father and grandfather.

Vulcan:
I'm asking you, not as a blacksmith but as a friend, to let me continue repairing the shield.

Matterhorn:
......

Vulcan:
Leave it to me. I'm sure you will be happy with the result.

Engineering Operator B:
Vulcan wasn't at the meeting just now, was she? I was working with her a few days ago, but I haven't seen her in the workshop lately.

Engineering Operator A:
She's looking for a new type of metal to repair Matterhorn's shield.

Engineering Operator B:
His shield?

Engineering Operator B:
But wasn't it heavily corroded by poison? I couldn't get that stuff off, no matter how hard I tried.

Engineering Operator B:
I thought he'd give up on it?

Engineering Operator A:
Yes, but I had a chat with him, and apparently Vulcan told him she could fix it.

Engineering Operator B:
Seriously?

Engineering Operator A:
You're new here, so you probably don't know that it used to be just her repairing everyone's weapons before we got more people in the department.

Engineering Operator A:
I even heard that she once forged a legendary weapon, which shook heaven and earth when it left the forge!

Engineering Operator A:
It made all of Rhodes Island tremble... possibly a little exaggerated, of course, but she definitely lives up to her code name.

Engineering Operator B:
Oh, how I want to bear witness to her work...

Engineering Operator B:
Is she in the workshop? Can I go watch after I finish my work?

Engineering Operator A:
Nope, she went out to hunt for ore after assigning my duties.

Engineering Operator A:
She's probably digging around in a cave somewhere.

Villager's Voice:
Careful, girl! A big monster lives in that hole. No one dares get close to it.

Villager's Voice:
Trust me, plenty of folks have come looking for gold or treasure, but very few have returned.

Villager's Voice:
And with a leg like that! You're walking into a death trap.

Vulcan:
......

Vulcan:
Just keep your distance, sir.

Villager's Voice:
*sigh* Young folks these days.

Vulcan:
Phew...

Vulcan:
Here. Not far from the projected position.

Vulcan:
Environment and scale are within projections.

Vulcan:
The terrain may present some difficulties, but the bait and sedative are ready.

Vulcan:
Kjerag steel is forged in a way that makes it stronger in a cold environment. It will take the perfect replacement to repair it.

Vulcan:
A few years ago, I found a small piece of crystal on an Originium slug. It had absorbed the slug's secretions, making it extremely strong.

Vulcan:
......

Vulcan:
The well is about 300m deep. My gear checks out.

Vulcan:
...I think I got something!

Vulcan:
Good, they're all out cold.

Vulcan:
Don't worry, this won't hurt... all I need is some of these crystals...

Vulcan:
Oh no, there's another nest in back!

Vulcan:
Completed deposit and strength testing under different temperatures.

Vulcan:
Layering looks like it can work well. Layering steel with materials that have high tensile strength helps keep the weapon together during impact.

Vulcan:
I need to think about quenching time and temperature, however.

Vulcan:
I tried a partial quenching a couple of days ago, and the metal shattered.

Vulcan:
More precise temperature control is required.

Vulcan:
I'll need to remove this shelf to make room in the workshop.

Vulcan:
Columbia really does make fine machines.

Vulcan:
...Let's start.

Vulcan:
Highlight composition ratios, oxygen levels...

Vulcan:
Setting temperature and time based on this...

Vulcan:
Adjust the angle... increase temperature... initialize...

Vulcan:
Alright, that's close to maximum!

Vulcan:
There we go!

Vulcan:
*cough* A new forging method—

Vulcan:
Test successful.

Dobermann:
Vulcan? What are you doing here?

Vulcan:
Good morning, Instructor Dobermann.

Vulcan:
Can I use the training facilities to test this shield?

Dobermann:
Of course.

Dobermann:
Should I grab a trainee or two to help you out? Practicing with a veteran will do them some good.

Vulcan:
Even better, thanks.

Reserve Operator:
Ready, Instructor!

Vulcan:
That's not enough. Don't hold anything back. Throw everything you have at the shield.

Vulcan:
Don't worry about injuring me.

Reserve Operator:
Instructor...?

Dobermann:
Do it. Vulcan is a lot stronger than you are, and she's forged this shield using a new method.

Reserve Operator:
Yes, ma'am!

Reserve Operator:
*pant*... *pant*...

Dobermann:
Well?

Vulcan:
Can I ask you to give it a try yourself, Instructor Dobermann?

Dobermann:
Sure.

Dobermann:
Ready!

Dobermann:
Go!

Dobermann:
Nice shield!

Engineering Operator B:
C-Closure! Excuse me...

Closure:
What's up?

Engineering Operator B:
Did... did Vulcan really make a weapon that made Rhodes Island tremble?

Closure:
......

Closure:
Who told you that?

Two weeks later...

Vulcan:
Whew—

Vulcan:
All done.

Vulcan:
And right on schedule.

Vulcan:
There's time for one more round of tests before the deadline.

Matterhorn:
Excuse me, Vulcan, are you there?

Vulcan:
Come in, please.

Vulcan:
I've fixed your shield.

Matterhorn:
I...

Matterhorn:
Sorry, Vulcan, I didn't think you would actually pull it off...

Vulcan:
Try it.

Matterhorn:
It... it really is my shield!

Matterhorn:
You really made it good as new!

Vulcan:
Yes. I used a new forging method, and found a mineral with the right tensile strength to supplement the steel.

Vulcan:
It's not quite as cold-resistant as the original, but the layered structure allows it to maintain adequate strength even in extreme conditions.

Vulcan:
It's every bit as strong as it was. I didn't do anything with the shape, but I've added some Originium circuits in the back. They're automatically triggered and don't require the user to be skilled with Arts.

Vulcan:
Don't test it here, though; do it with the equipment at the training grounds.

Matterhorn:
I...

Matterhorn:
I never thought... I didn't think it was possible, but you...

Matterhorn:
In just two weeks?

Vulcan:
Two weeks was plenty.

Matterhorn:
I didn't know... When you went on a field trip a few days ago, I thought it was going to get delayed...

Matterhorn:
Thank you so much, Vulcan.

Vulcan:
This is my job, after all.

Vulcan:
I do this to help operators fix their weapons, meet their needs, and allow the equipment to perform at its best.

Vulcan:
Each person's armament means something different to its owner.

Vulcan:
As a craftsman, I strive to deliver the best results.

Vulcan:
That's all.
