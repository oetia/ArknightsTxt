Produce Vendor:
Excuse me, I see you've been circling the market for a while now. Are you having trouble finding what you need?

Lee:
Oh, are you talking to me?

Produce Vendor:
I am. We're about to close soon, so if you don't leave, you'll have to spend the night here.

Lee:
But it's not even seven.

Produce Vendor:
Heh, knew you weren't from around these parts. This place is a complete mess at night. Nobody in their right mind would keep their doors open late.

Lee:
I did happen to arrive just a few days ago. Only settled into an inn around here last night.

Produce Vendor:
There are so many places you could go to in Lungmen. Why visit our tiny little market?

Lee:
Just a little habit of mine. Whenever I go to a new place, I like checking out the local market.

Lee:
These places are always a good gauge of customs, mannerisms, and local color.

Produce Vendor:
Aren't all markets the same? Noisy as hell, just a bunch of people coming and going?

Lee:
Well, for starters... the market in Shangshu can stay open all night, but not this one here.

Produce Vendor:
Oh...?

Produce Vendor:
So, were you going to buy something? I'm closing up my stall otherwise.

Lee:
What would you recommend?

Produce Vendor:
We're in the dead of summer and it's hot out there. Maybe grab a couple sprigs of wild bamboo shoots and make porridge out of em' to relieve heat and prevent heatstroke.

Lee:
Hmm, maybe next time then. I don't think the icebox in the inn is big enough to hold half-meter bamboo shoots.

Produce Vendor:
Huh... Strange fellow.

Produce Vendor:
Gonna end up going home late because of him...

Street Thug:
Hey, lou sai, isn't it a bit early to be closing up shop?

Produce Vendor:
(Ugh, can't dodge these scumbags even at this time of day...?)

Street Thug:
You ready to pay up? Don't forget what you owe me from last month.

Produce Vendor:
B-Business has been slow th-the last few months... I sincerely apologize, but I truly have nothing worthy of your attention...

Street Thug:
Well that's too bad. Get your ass outta here then. Somebody more capable can take your spot.

Produce Vendor:
Hey, wait! What are you doing?!

Produce Vendor:
Let go of me! D-Don't smash it! Please, give me just a little more time! I promise I'll have the money for you!

Street Thug:
Pah! Too late!

???:
Now, now, my brother. Let's play nice here.

Street Thug:
Huh, who the hell are you, old man?

Lee:
Old man? My, you do flatter me with that honorific. I'm more than happy to just be brothers.

Street Thug:
I'd watch my tone, if I were you. While you're at it, shouldn't you ask who I'm working for?

Lee:
Would it be the illustrious Lin family?

Street Thug:
If you know that much, then show some respect.

Lee:
(My goodness. Why do eight out of every ten hoodlums I run into in this city say they're working for Lin?)

Lee:
Aha, no wonder why you looked a bit familiar. I remember seeing you at the Lin estate.

Street Thug:
Uhh... Y-You know me?

Lee:
Of course I do. The golden osmanthus flowers were blooming magnificently at Old Lin's place last year, and he made plenty of honeyed osmanthus. Did you also take some home with you?

Street Thug:
O-Of course! Before I left, Old Lin gave me a dozen jars. I couldn't even finish them all.

Lee:
Hmm, oh my... I forgot to mention, Old Lin doesn't grow sweet osmanthus in front of his house. They're peach trees.

Street Thug:
Diu nei ah, do you know Lin or not?

Lee:
Maybe I do, maybe I don't. But I can say for a fact that you don't.

Lee:
If you know what's good for you, beat it. I hear Old Lin's governance is pretty strict. If he knew someone was using his name to do evil, such a man wouldn't get off lightly.

Street Thug:
Bah. Talk about rotten luck.

Produce Vendor:
Err... Sir, thank you very much.

Lee:
Don't worry about it, it's not like I even lifted a finger. The next time you run into these scoundrels, know that there's nothing to be afraid of. Most of these thugs are just nobodies trying to take advantage of the situation to extort people. There's no way real gangsters would be this brazen.

Produce Vendor:
*sigh*... I'm just a small-time peddler. How can I tell if someone's a big deal?

Produce Vendor:
Wait, don't go yet.

Lee:
Hmm?

Produce Vendor:
The icebox in your inn might be small, but it should fit this bag of lychee just fine.

Produce Vendor:
Planted 'em in my own backyard. They're not worth any money, but they should still taste fine. It's the least I can do.

Lee:
......

Produce Vendor:
...Sir?

Lee:
Ahh, I was just thinking, getting to enjoy the wonderful taste of lychee makes the long trek out here worth it.

Produce Vendor:
Hah, I'm glad to hear it. If you enjoy 'em, feel free to come back any time.

Lee:
Sure.

Produce Vendor:
Mr. Lee! Hey, Mr. Lee!

Lee:
Well, if it isn't Choi, our honorable vendor. I heard you calling out to me before I even stepped into the market.

Produce Vendor:
I just don't want you left with bamboo shoots that aren't fresh anymore. The cold season is the perfect time to enjoy these winter shoots.

Lee:
There's no way they'd go bad in just a few minutes, is there?

Produce Vendor:
Remember to soak them in salt water once you take them back. That'll make 'em last longer.

Lee:
Maybe next time. The kitchen in the place I rented only has enough room for a couple produce bags before I have to throw them in the icebox.

Produce Vendor:
I won't take no for an answer. This is the finest white-eyed bamboo I have. I saved it for you because you're a man of character.

Lee:
Really, it's alright. I'll have an honored guest over in just a few days. The stuff's not going to keep for very long.

Produce Vendor:
Oh, you've made friends in Lungmen?

Lee:
Not sure friends is the right word.

???:
Then, what must I do to be considered your friend?

Lee:
Oh, Mr. Lin, are you here to pick up fresh produce for your wife?

Lin:
The wife isn't so picky. She wouldn't send me to a market more than ten kilometers away just to pick up some bamboo shoots.

Produce Vendor:
(Wait, Mr. Lee... Is, is it really him...?)

Lee:
(Just treat him as you would a regular passerby.)

Lin:
You haven't answered my question yet.

Lee:
Please, I'm just an ordinary civilian. The man who invites me to a fancy banquet at a nice restaurant is already a bosom friend to me.

Lin:
That's not what my men have been telling me. Apparently, you've been in and out of all the small eateries around here this past week.

Lee:
If you could've found me at all those other places, why come out to this market so far from home?

Lin:
I wouldn't make the trip for a few stalks of bamboo shoots, but for a friend, I'd consider it worthwhile.

Lee:
You speak too highly of me, Mr. Lin. I just took care of a few odd jobs for you, that's all. Even without me, you would've been able to resolve things just fine.

Lin:
I disagree. Had you not been there, I doubt the outcome would've been comparable.

Lee:
Ah... Mr. Lin, I know exactly how much I'm worth.

Lin:
So, how do you plan to cook these bamboo shoots? They're very high-quality.

Lee:
A nice and simple braising sounds tasty enough.

Lin:
Such a pedestrian method is a waste of perfectly good ingredients. If you ask me, it'd be better to slaughter a fowlbeast fresh and make some hearty stew.

Lee:
Then, you're no longer appreciating the delicate sweetness of the bamboo shoots.

Lee:
Besides...

Lin:
Let's hear it.

Lee:
Hah. Besides, these bamboo shoots came from the countryside. They be of willful temperament. I doubt they'd pair well with other ingredients.

Lin:
The biggest concern is that they grow too well. Even deep in the mountains and ancient forests, they'll attract wave after wave of bamboo shoot diggers.

Lin:
That being the case, how could they ever hope to live a life of peace and contentment?

Lee:
Haha, that remains to be seen.

Lin:
Wei would not visit a man's home for no reason...

Lee:
I believe.

Lin:
Believe what?

Lee:
I believe... that once Master Wei picks up the chopsticks, he won't be able to stop to chat with me.

Lin:
Hmm... Lou sai, do you sell apples here?

Produce Vendor:
Ah, yes, I certainly do. I'll get them for you right away, Mr. Lin.

Lin:
How much?

Produce Vendor:
Ah, um, that won't be necessary. The fact that we've been able to live in peace all these years thanks to you is payment enough.

Lin:
It's not easy running a business. Here, take it.

Lee:
Didn't you say you weren't buying anything?

Lin:
Since I'm already here, might as well grab something for my daughter.

Lee:
Aiya, men do change after kids. I wanted to invite you to see the flowers at Jiangqi next year, but I suppose I'll have to give up on the idea.

Lin:
I suggest you settle down as well, and leave behind that life of wandering.

Lee:
Forget it. That isn't the life I'm searching for anyway.

Produce Vendor:
Madam, take a look at this season's greengage. Thin skin, thick flesh, and a tiny core. Tangy and delectably sweet, one bite and you'll be salivating for more.

Fumizuki:
Hmm...

Produce Vendor:
If you don't take a few catties back with you today to make wine, you won't be get to experience this flavor after the Qingming Festival passes.

Fumizuki:
Alright... Weigh some out for me then.

Produce Vendor:
Right away. You know, there's a saying that goes 'green plum wine tastes freshest in season.' ...Hah, I'm not particularly well-read, I just happened to hear that somewhere.

Lee:
Choi, I hear you buttering up your customers from over here, trying to get into their pockets, eh? You've... become quite the smooth talker.

Produce Vendor:
Oh come on, it's just business.

Fumizuki:
Do you come here often, Mr. Lee?

Lee:
Long time no see. What brings you out here today, Madam?

Fumizuki:
This is the largest, most comprehensive produce market in Lungmen. Naturally, the best choice whenever you need ingredients.

Lee:
What kind of ingredients need you coming out here in person?

Fumizuki:
Well, Yenwu's birthday is coming up, and I'd like to make him a few dishes.

Lee:
What do you have in mind?

Fumizuki:
I haven't decided yet, but it wouldn't be anything more than what he normally likes to eat.

Lee:
I'm sure Master Wei's preferences... must be quite a test for your culinary skills.

Fumizuki:
Hardly. What's a little effort if your heart is in the right place?

Lee:
Fair enough.

Fumizuki:
But I'll admit... as this is my first time here, I'm having difficulty picking out what I want. I'd appreciate your advice if you don't mind.

Lee:
Sure, can do. Take these tomatoes for example. If you want to just eat them as you would a fruit, go with a pink one, which has a crispier texture. If you're cooking with them, opt for the deep red ones, which are juicier and have a stronger taste.

Fumizuki:
Alright, I'll keep that in mind. They have some taro over there. I'd like to make some taro smoked meat.

Lee:
Taro, huh? Given tubers of about the same size, go with the heaviest one. That means it has a greater water and starch content, which leads to a soft, glutinous taste.

Fumizuki:
Great. What about shiitake mushrooms then? Should I go with dried, or fresh?

Lee:
Both have their advantages, Madam. It all depends on what you want to cook.

Fumizuki:
Stuffed mushrooms.

Lee:
Go with dried shiitake in that case, they have greater pungency after soaking.

Fumizuki:
Oh... I see.

Lee:
Before I forget, there's a store up ahead that sells soy sauce. It's perfect for making braised fowlbeast.

Produce Vendor:
(Though, they recently raised their prices.)

Lee:
(You don't need to worry about that, Choi.)

Fumizuki:
For the rose petal and soy sauce glaze?

Lee:
Mmhmm.

Fumizuki:
Actually about that... Yenwu does eat this dish often, but only because I'm the one who's quite fond of it.

Lee:
I'm aware.

Fumizuki:
Hmm?

Lee:
He's brought it up at the dinner table before. Is it so unusual for his tastes to take after those of his wife?

Fumizuki:
Pfft... Haha.

Fumizuki:
You're a smoother talker than that vendor.

Lee:
Haha. Speaking of which, I've become a bit of a businessman myself lately.

Fumizuki:
Haven't you always been easygoing with your finances? From the very beginning, Yenwu repeatedly asked you to take up a very important position in the L.G.D., but you refused each time. Why are you worrying about your livelihood now?

Lee:
There's an extra mouth to feed back home now, so I need to run some errands to cover the living expenses.

Fumizuki:
Hmm? Are you finally starting your own family? Yenwu and I can stop by and offer our congratulations one of these days.

Lee:
It's more like... Actually, an old friend came from afar and left a child behind in my care.

Fumizuki:
(Shakes head)

Fumizuki:
How terribly irresponsible... Did he say when he'd be back?

Lee:
No... But there's no way he'd just abandon the girl, right? I reckon he'll be back after a few months.

Lee:
After I hand the girl back to him, I plan to take a page out of his book and go on a long trip myself.

Fumizuki:
What, Lungmen isn't good enough for you?

Lee:
No, it certainly is. But, I am a wanderer after all. Can't stay in a single place too long.

Fumizuki:
*sigh*... In any case, thanks for your advice, Mr. Lee. I pretty much have everything I need now, so I should get going.

Lee:
Take it easy, Madam.

Lee:
......

Produce Vendor:
Mr. Lee! Psst, Mr. Lee!

Lee:
Oh... Did you need something, Choi?

Produce Vendor:
You've been standing here all day, you know? Other people have to shop too.

Lee:
Sorry about that, haha. How much for the imported cherries?

Produce Vendor:
Didn't you say they were too expensive for you?

Lee:
Yes, but the kid likes 'em, so I figure I can take a few catties home and give them a try.

Lee:
By the way, did the stuff I ordered from you last week come in yet?

Produce Vendor:
Sure did. I have everything ready for you.

Lee:
My, I'm sorry. I had some stuff to take care of at home today. Sorry to keep you waiting.

Produce Vendor:
Haha, don't worry about it. It's not even nine yet, and the sun hasn't even set. Too early to close up.

Produce Vendor:
But, why'd you come here yourself? Couldn't you just send your apprentice over?

Lee:
He had work to take care of today. We just moved into the new place, so he went with Waai Fu and Aak to tidy up.

Produce Vendor:
You moved? Was the old place getting too cramped?

Lee:
Yup. Didn't have as many rooms as I would've liked, which made it hard to have guests over. Also wanted to add another freezer, but the kitchen was too small.

Produce Vendor:
Are two freezers not enough for you?

Lee:
That's what happens when you have multiple mouths to feed. Thankfully, Hung's learned the ropes by now, or I'd keel over dead from all that cooking.

Produce Vendor:
You know, nobody's gonna shed any tears if none of your other talents get passed down. But, the world can't afford to lose your culinary skills. Having him here is already a huge relief.

Lee:
He's only just scratched the surface. He's far from ready.

Produce Vendor:
So, are you going to cook by yourself today?

Lee:
Yes indeed. They've been busy all day, and deserve a proper reward.

Produce Vendor:
Haha! Take this potted kumquat with you then. To your new firm's successful opening and continued prosperity.

Lee:
Oh? Isn't this tree very important to you? You've kept it in the store for years, and never let anyone go around touching it.

Lee:
The cold season just passed, and it's bearing rich fruit. Why... are you giving it to me now?

Produce Vendor:
To be honest with you, Lee, I don't plan on keeping this shop open much longer.

Lee:
Are you moving somewhere else?

Produce Vendor:
I'm about ready to retire.

Lee:
......

Lee:
It's been more than a decade, huh...

Produce Vendor:
Almost thirty years, including the time before you started coming.

Produce Vendor:
Just got a notice last month saying that this place is going to be demolished and converted into a supermarket. Though, we'd still be able to preserve the shop.

Lee:
Too many places have been going down around Lungmen these days... The teahouse near my place also got demolished, and they say it's going to turn into a coffee shop.

Produce Vendor:
Hah, that's exactly it. It's fine though. My wife and I have worked so hard all these years. It's time to rest now.

Lee:
Your son and daughter have grown up and moved out as well, so there's no point to holding down the fort any longer. Why don't you travel, take in some new sights and sounds?

Produce Vendor:
We've been in Lungmen all these years, and haven't seen any of Yan's other cities yet.

Produce Vendor:
The savings we've scrounged up over the years, as well as the compensation from the government, should be enough to give us a few years of good fun.

Produce Vendor:
Lee, you've been all over the place. Got any recommendations for us?

Lee:
I've pretty much settled down in Lungmen too. Asking me to suddenly think back to my days on the road is no easy task.

Lee:
But, when I think about it a bit more closely, all the bad things that happened are like dark clouds parting after a storm. What remains most vividly... is pleasant scenery and warm smiles.

Produce Vendor:
And, a noisy produce market.

Lee:
Hahahaha! You still remember our conversation from back then, huh?

Produce Vendor:
Once I go to Shangshu myself, I'll have to visit that 24/7 produce market as soon as I get the chance.

Lee:
Good... Very good.

Produce Vendor:
Looking back all these years, every time I saw you, you always said you were going to leave Lungmen. But now, more than ten years later, turns out I'll be the one who's leaving.

Lee:
That's right. Every time I tried to leave, there would always be some happy little accident tying me down.

Lee:
Anyway... Choi, a lot of people come to me before setting off on their trips, asking me to read their fortunes.

Lee:
We've been old friends for so many years now, so I don't mind giving you a free reading today. Want me to tell you how your journey's going to go?

Produce Vendor:
Haha, sure.

Lee:
Hmm...

Produce Vendor:
What does it say?

Lee:
This is the Shih-Wang hexagram, which is a symbol of great auspice. On this journey, you will enjoy smooth travels, fair weather, and good health.

Produce Vendor:
Hahaha, you really know how to say what people want to hear.

Lee:
I'm not trying to butter you up, Choi. This is my heartfelt desire. That fate... will bring us together again in the future.

Produce Vendor:
...May fate bring us together again.

Supermarket Broadcast:
Winter's almost here! That's right, winter's almost here! That means we're offering great deals here at the supermarket–buy one get one free on certain selections of fresh meat! Winter's almost here! That's right, winter's almost here! That means we're offering great deals here at the supermarket–buy one get one free on...

Waai Fu:
How long have we been standing in line, Hung? Is this ever going to end?

Hung:
Just a bit longer. There's a big sale at the supermarket today, so a lot more people showed up than usual.

Waai Fu:
All over a piece of meat? My legs are gonna fall off from all this standing. I don't even get this tired from holding my martial arts poses.

Hung:
A few days ago, Mr. Lee went out of his way to order braised leg meat in scallion oil, saying he wanted to eat it over his birthday. Luckily, they're selling that meat fresh at the supermarket today. Wait a few days longer and we'd only be able to get our hands on the frozen stuff.

Waai Fu:
I swear, the older he gets, the more childish he becomes. Whenever he wants to eat something, he has to have it then and there.

Hung:
Well, birthdays are when your dreams are supposed to come true.

Hung:
You say all that, but weren't you the one who picked out a present well in advance and hid it in your room?

Waai Fu:
H-How'd you find out? Didn't I say I can clean my room just fine by myself?!

Hung:
I didn't go into your room... I just happened to see a bin filled with wrapping paper when I went to take out the trash.

Waai Fu:
Argh, I didn't think it'd be so hard to wrap up a present either! Had to wrap it and unwrap it so many times before I finally managed to fold it flat.

Supermarket Worker:
What would you like to get, Sir?

Hung:
A cut of leg meat, please.

Supermarket Worker:
Front or rear?

Hung:
Rear.

Hung:
Waai Fu, have you seen Aak? Why isn't he here yet? We need to head back after picking up the meat.

Waai Fu:
No clue. He disappeared as soon as we went inside.

Waai Fu:
(Looks all around) Ugh...

Waai Fu:
Oh, isn't that him right there? He's walking toward us.

Waai Fu:
Where've you been all this time? And what did you buy?

Aak:
Nothing. Just window shopping for something I could pick up for Old Lee.

Hung:
Didn't see anything you liked?

Aak:
Hehe, nope.

Cashier:
That'll be a total of 471 LMD. Will you be paying cash or card?

Hung:
Excuse me, Miss... I think you did the math wrong.

Cashier:
Huh? We calculate everything by machine. There's no way it would be wrong.

Hung:
(Strange, how is more expensive than what I calculated?)

Hung:
Waai Fu, mind opening the bag up for me? Let me add things up again.

Waai Fu:
Don't worry about it, Hung. You might've made a little slip-up. Let's hurry up and head home with our stuff first.

Aak:
Yeah, that's right. We've been out all day, and I'm sure Waai Fu here is tired. Let's go home and get some rest.

Hung and Waai Fu:
......

Hung:
Waai Fu, open the bag.

Waai Fu:
Here you go, Hung. Comb through everything carefully.

Aak:
(Oops, should've kept my mouth shut...)

Hung:
Leg meat, white radishes, pumpkin, lotus root...

Waai Fu:
Umm, Hung, there seems to be a pouch of herbs at the bottom of the bag.

Waai Fu:
Aah... Achoo! *cough* *cough*... What the heck is this stuff? It stings!

Hung:
*cough* *cough* *wheeze*... What is <i>this?!</i>

Aak:
Huh? What are you two lookin' at me for? Nobody ever said you had to open it up.

Aak:
If anything, the stuff the two of you are gettin' for Lee is way too boring.

Aak:
Anyway, I'll head back first. The two of you can catch up later.

Waai Fu:
*cough* *cough* *cough*... Why you little...

Waai Fu:
Get back here, you little!
