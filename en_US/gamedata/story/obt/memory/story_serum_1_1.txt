'The Next Step in Corrosive Research, and Corresponding Protection Countermeasures'

Project Leaders: Corroserum, Astgenne

Corroserum:
Good work, everyone.

Corroserum:
Now if you don't mind...

No sooner has Corroserum said this than he puts on his blindfold to take a break, as is his habit.

Astgenne:
Good evening, Doctor.

Corroserum:
Doctor.

Corroserum:
Good evening.

Corroserum:
If you're really curious...

Corroserum:
Could I ask you to hold this up for a moment?

Corroserum:
No need to panic, the experiment will be conducted within controllable limits.

Corroserum:
The armor plate you're holding has our latest reworked protective coating applied, which should suffice to ensure your safety.

Corroserum:
As you can see, it has previously suffered a degree of corrosive wear. However, the improvement to our new coating technology lies not in anti-corrosion.

Corroserum:
Care to begin, Astgenne? Please attack the plate with Originium Arts.

Astgenne:
Hold up, isn't this method a little dangerous for an experiment?

Corroserum:
Your cooperation is greatly appreciated, Doctor.

Astgenne:
Well, I... Okay, then...

Corroserum:
That's right, this improved protective coating retains a level of resistance against Arts attacks even when corroded. That's new.

Corroserum:
Of course, all credit is due to Astgenne and her efforts.

Corroserum:
Unfortunately, I have yet to achieve any particular breakthroughs on the corrosive front.

Astgenne:
......

Astgenne:
Sorry about this, Doctor. I need you to play along with me for one more attack.

Astgenne:
Lightning, illuminate! Hah!

Astgenne:
Thought so... It took such an excessive attack just to pierce the plate's defenses.

Astgenne:
Oh, uh! You're okay, right? Sorry... I...

Astgenne:
Phew... Sorry.

Corroserum:
As should be obvious, this protective coating's strength has far exceeded the project goals.

Astgenne:
But it still hasn't reached the theoretical limit of the design.

Astgenne:
What if we took it a step further? I think there's a call for more testing.

Corroserum:
I agree, but I also wouldn't consider it wise to chase the theoretical limit.

Astgenne:
......

Astgenne:
I need to make a detailed record of the results of this trial.

Astgenne:
Thank you, Doctor.

Corroserum:
Doctor, it just passed six o'clock.

Corroserum:
Please allow me to clock out for the day. Thank you very much for joining us for today's experiment.

Corroserum:
Oh right, I have some candy from Quercus and Yanese tea from Mister Lee sitting on my desk. They're both excellent for relieving fatigue, so please feel free to help yourself.

Corroserum:
In any case... I'll see the two of you later.

Astgenne:
......

Astgenne:
Oh... Don't worry about me. I might be working late again.

Astgenne:
I still need to do a bit more research and testing.

Corroserum:
(Takes a deep breath)

Corroserum:
(Stretches)

Corroserum:
(Takes a deep breath)

Corroserum:
Phew... Time to head back!

Corroserum:
Oops, music's a bit loud. Wouldn't want to disturb others. I'll have to turn it down a little.

Corroserum:
Hmm hmm~ (Grooves along with the music)

Corroserum:
Gotta turn on the humidifier since the room's a bit dry.

Engineering Operator:
Project Lead Corroserum, are you in?

Engineering Operator:
I have something for you.

Engineering Operator:
These are the materials you requested. Please sign here, if you don't mind.

Corroserum:
Thanks a bunch. Go ahead and leave the stuff over in that corner.

Corroserum:
You can go after dropping it off. I'll sort it all out myself later.

Engineering Operator:
By the way, why'd you request so many discarded experimental materials? And not just from our team either.

Corroserum:
It's not work-related; just a personal hobby of mine.

Engineering Operator:
......

Engineering Operator:
A personal hobby, huh... And for Astgenne, it was a personal idea.

Engineering Operator:
I really have no clue what the two of you are working on in secret.

Corroserum:
Here's the receipt.

Corroserum:
Did you need anything else?

Engineering Operator:
Corroserum... When I left the lab just now, ours was the only one with the lights still on.

Engineering Operator:
Astgenne hasn't been back to her room for days now. I think... you should go check up on her.

Raythean Industries Experimental Engineering Department

Senior Project Manager:
Come in.

Corroserum:
Hello, everyone! I'm the new researcher, Corroserum, and my specialty is...

Senior Project Manager:
Alright, fill out these forms first and bring them over to the accountant's office by tonight.

Corroserum:
Sure! If any of you need any help, feel free to give me a call.

Senior Project Manager:
Let's get started.

Corroserum:
On it!

Senior Project Manager:
Not leaving yet?

Corroserum:
I'm not heading back today.

Corroserum:
Not like I have anything else to do, so I might as well knock this out.

Senior Project Manager:
Relax, you still have plenty of time.

Corroserum:
Yeah, I know. I just happened to have a flash of inspiration.

Corroserum:
You can head back first.

Senior Project Manager:
By the way, Corroserum, how long have you been with the Engineering Department?

Corroserum:
...About half a year?

Senior Project Manager:
Oh...

Senior Project Manager:
Good luck then.

Corroserum:
Yup!

Senior Project Manager:
Corroserum, come here for a moment.

Corroserum:
What is it?

Senior Project Manager:
It's been two years since you joined the Engineering Department, right? I've always seen you as an intelligent and hardworking young man.

Corroserum:
Thanks, boss!

Senior Project Manager:
So... There's a project, but it's not one of ours. It belongs to a friend of mine in the military, and they urgently need a new type of protective material for their soldiers.

Corroserum:
I can handle it.

Senior Project Manager:
I'm not joking around here. Think it through carefully—I have no way of sending you extra assistants, and you can't afford to fall behind in your day-to-day work here either.

Corroserum:
Trust me, I can handle it.

Senior Project Manager:
......

Senior Project Manager:
Fine, do your best.

Corroserum:
Will do!

Astgenne:
This data set... shouldn't be possible.

Astgenne:
How could he have missed such an obvious error?

Astgenne:
...Weren't you supposed to be off work?

Corroserum:
Sorry to bother you. I'm just back to pick up a file.

Corroserum:
And, I'll be taking my leave now.

Astgenne:
Wait, hold on a second!

Corroserum:
Hmm? Did you need something?

Astgenne:
I did have a question, about the corrosive agent you were in charge of improving.

Corroserum:
Ask away.

Astgenne:
You haven't made any progress with it for months now. Even when I joined up with the rest of the team, we couldn't move forward at all.

Corroserum:
True. Admittedly, development in this area has been more difficult than I imagined.

Astgenne:
I've always had my suspicions, since from a data-perspective these kinds of results shouldn't be possible. But I never thought about it too much since I trusted you.

Astgenne:
Until just now, when I checked the records of previous experiments and stumbled upon this...

Astgenne:
Your sample report.

Corroserum:
Was there some sort of problem with it?

Astgenne:
Was there a problem?!

Astgenne:
In each batch of samples you make, you use less of the active ingredient than we calculated for.

Astgenne:
In other words, the samples we've been testing over the last few months have all been incomplete, defective products!

Astgenne:
No wonder the experimental results of your corrosive agents have been so disappointing. This whole time, we've barely met the minimum project design requirements.

Corroserum:
......

Corroserum:
Sorry, this does appear to be a major oversight on my part.

Astgenne:
You're telling me you somehow managed to miss all this?

Corroserum:
Yes, for which I deeply apologize.

Astgenne:
......

Corroserum:
......

Astgenne:
Then can you make some new samples that actually match the data we're using?

Corroserum:
Sorry, but not right now.

Corroserum:
Because I'm off work.

Astgenne:
Hey–!

Corroserum:
You'll have my complete cooperation tomorrow, but I really must get going.

Corroserum:
Regarding the serious errors in my work, I will explain the situation to the Doctor myself, and take full responsibility for the consequences.

Corroserum:
In any case... See you tomorrow.

Astgenne:
Hey!

Astgenne:
Corroserum!

Corroserum:
(Takes a deep breath)

Corroserum:
(Confront your work.)

Corroserum:
(All of its facets.)

Corroserum:
(All your different colleagues.)

Corroserum:
(What expression would be the most appropriate?)

Senior Project Manager:
Corroserum, what the hell have you been doing?!

Senior Project Manager:
This is what I get for trusting you so much!

Corroserum:
But... our data indicate that this performs twice as well as the original requirements.

Senior Project Manager:
And it costs how much?! Do you have any idea how much we'd have to sell just to recoup our expenses?

Senior Project Manager:
Are you <i>trying</i> to lose us money here? Not to mention how the client is going to balk at the price tag.

Corroserum:
But, didn't you say they were your friend...?

Senior Project Manager:
Good grief... Young man...

Senior Project Manager:
Step outside for a moment.

Corroserum:
But sir...

Senior Project Manager:
Get out!

Corroserum:
...Alright.

Senior Project Manager:
Everyone! Put whatever you're doing on hold! We have an urgent project that needs to get done.

Senior Project Manager:
What you were just issued is a new type of protective material that showed up on the battlefield.

Corroserum:
This?!

Senior Project Manager:
Right now, one of our important clients urgently needs an agent that can deal with this protective material.

Senior Project Manager:
We've been given a hard deadline of one month, so during this time I need everyone here to give it their all. No taking time off, no slacking! This MUST get done!

Senior Project Manager:
Does everyone understand?

Corroserum:
Boss...

Senior Project Manager:
What?

Corroserum:
This material... I think I've felt something very similar half a year ago...

Senior Project Manager:
Get to work already! If you have something to say, tell me later.

Corroserum:
......

Senior Project Manager:
Did you hear me?

Corroserum:
Yes, I understand.

Customer Representative:
Are all our people here?

Corroserum:
Yes, my colleague had something to attend to, so let's get started.

Customer Representative:
Very well... We've already received the data sheets you submitted, as well as tested the samples you gave us.

Customer Representative:
Without a doubt, they meet our standards when it comes to performance, quality, and other measures. However...

Corroserum:
Is there an issue?

Customer Representative:
So here's the situation. We've been... having a number of internal reorganizations lately. A lot has changed.

Customer Representative:
The new manager proposed a new target policy, and was dissatisfied with the performance of the current corrosive agent. He would like you to meet the following benchmarks.

Corroserum:
A corrosion index requirement as high as this... practically falls under the category of a WMD.

Customer Representative:
It's... for personal protective use.

Customer Representative:
Also, for whatever reason, the budget for this project has been slashed.

Customer Representative:
Therefore, you might encounter some difficulties in terms of controlling costs and future development expenses. I hope you understand.

Corroserum:
Sorry, but allow me to say something.

Corroserum:
First of all, I can't guarantee that we can meet these new benchmarks. It's something I'd have to discuss with my teammates first.

Corroserum:
Second, an extended R&D cycle would inevitably lead to an increase in development costs. If you're going to cut the budget...

Customer Representative:
Um... In that case, how about removing some of the unnecessary protective systems? Just leave in the basic safety features.

Corroserum:
I must apologize, but making modifications to a chemical agent is not as simple as appending a line of text.

Customer Representative:
But we're talking about <i>removing</i> functionality here, right? Surely that's not so difficult for professionals like you.

Corroserum:
......

Customer Representative:
And, regarding the budget... There's truly nothing I can do about that. However, internally we do acknowledge the excellent work you've shown us.

Customer Representative:
Which is why I think of these as hurdles we can overcome together. ...We are, of course, very sorry for the trouble.

Customer Representative:
I trust we will have more opportunities to work together in the long-term.

Corroserum:
The one to make that decision will be...

Corroserum:
Doctor?

Customer Representative:
......

Customer Representative:
Understood. We'll discuss things again on our end.

Customer Representative:
Apologies. In light of the current situation, our side has decided to terminate R&D on this project.

Corroserum:
Thank you, Doctor. But I think this outcome is for the best.

Astgenne:
......

Corroserum:
......

Astgenne:
Doctor! Impeccable timing as always!

Astgenne:
After a few days of comparing the old experimental data, I've finally found the problem! Here's a sample of the new corrosive agent.

Astgenne:
Oh, and this time, you don't have to stand behind the armor plate. Just keep your eyes peeled!

Corroserum:
......

Astgenne:
Did you see that? The new agent completely ate through the previous version of the protective coating.

Astgenne:
But! But! For this new one, I've adjusted the way we approach our technical designs when it comes to the protective coating!

Astgenne:
What's wrong, Doctor?

Astgenne:
Did something go wrong at the meeting?

Corroserum:
......

Corroserum:
It's not that big of a deal.

Corroserum:
The client felt that the existing agent achieved the desired effect, but wanted us to make improvements to the protective aspect.

Corroserum:
Your hard work has given us a way forward for our future research.

Corroserum:
Also, these materials can be used to keep our own operators safe in the future. Isn't that right, Doctor?

Corroserum:
Oh right, Doctor.

Corroserum:
There's something we have to talk about.

Astgenne:
Thank you, Doctor!

Corroserum:
We were simply doing what had to be done.

Corroserum:
Oh right, Doctor.

Corroserum:
There's something we have to talk about.

Astgenne:
...Alright.

Corroserum:
Oh right, Doctor.

Corroserum:
There's something we have to talk about.

Corroserum:
So, during the research on the corrosive agent, I indeed made a mistake in the amount of a key ingredient.

Corroserum:
I am willing to accept any consequences for my error.

Corroserum:
Hmm?

Corroserum:
You do know what my area of expertise is, right?

Corroserum:
That's right. From the day I joined Engineering, I've been constantly going back and forth between corrosion and anti-corrosion in my research, encountering no shortage of setbacks and breakthroughs.

Corroserum:
But I never paid attention to my own protection, nor did I consider that the reagents were silently eating away at me.

Corroserum:
Until one day, I realized that the things known as dreams, passions, and ideals are not so corrosion-proof after all.

Corroserum:
......

Corroserum:
So... Why not let Astgenne keep believing in her work, Doctor?

Corroserum:
Speaking of which, it's almost six o'clock.

Corroserum:
May I clock out now?

Corroserum:
Ask away.

Corroserum:
......

Corroserum:
You know, Great Yan has an old adage about the spear and the shield. Mister Lee told me the story a while ago.

Corroserum:
When you hold the strongest shield, there will invariably be someone who wants to challenge it, to break through its limits. And from that was born the sharpest spear.

Corroserum:
And when the sharpest spear becomes undefeatable, there will invariably be someone who seeks to challenge its deadly strength. And from that was born the strongest shield.

Corroserum:
It is a never-ending cycle, one in which nobody can predict the end result.

Corroserum:
Unless...

Corroserum:
There is nobody left to pick up a spear or shield.

Corroserum:
Ah... I didn't mean to go off on a tangent. In any case, I made a mistake in my work, and I'm solely responsible for it.

Corroserum:
But we can talk about this more at work tomorrow.

Corroserum:
After all, I'm off-the-clock.

Corroserum:
(Takes a deep breath)

Corroserum:
(Stretches)

Corroserum:
(Takes a deep breath)

Corroserum:
Hmm?

Corroserum:
Do you really want to know, Doctor?

Senior Project Manager:
I'm asking you, can it cause obvious damage to the target?

Corroserum:
Absolutely. After all, that material was made with the same formula I experimented with once before.

Corroserum:
Though I'm not sure how it made its way out into the wild.

Senior Project Manager:
Son of a gun...

Senior Project Manager:
And what's the current safe service life of this weapon?

Corroserum:
Around thirty allowances of ammunition.

Senior Project Manager:
Can you make a bulk delivery in time?

Corroserum:
No, because we haven't finished testing. Those soldiers would be marching off to their deaths.

Corroserum:
......

Senior Project Manager:
Is there something wrong with you? Do I have to beat some sense into you?!

Senior Project Manager:
Our clients can't wait forever, and we have the stuff on hand right now! This is a business! This is how we put food on the table!

Corroserum:
......

Senior Project Manager:
People want something that works, meets their needs, and doesn't cost too much! That's all that matters!

Senior Project Manager:
As for what happens to the soldiers, does any of that affect you in any way? Does it?!

Corroserum:
......

Senior Project Manager:
Isn't thirty ammunition allowances' worth good enough? Who knows if the main forces can even use up that much.

Senior Project Manager:
You're still young, so would it kill you to use your head and think outside the box for once?

Senior Project Manager:
I'm seriously disappointed in you.

Corroserum:
(Is this really worth getting mad over?)

Corroserum:
(Of course it is.)

Corroserum:
(That said...)

Corroserum:
(This is just work.)

Corroserum:
(Why take it so seriously?)

Senior Project Manager:
What's with that look on your face?!

Corroserum:
Sorry, sir.

Corroserum:
In that case... I'll head back to work first.
