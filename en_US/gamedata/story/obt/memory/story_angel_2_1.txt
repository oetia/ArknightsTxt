Dawn Destroyer:
I'm curious now. Where did you run off to in the time it took me to use the toilet?

Mostima:
Would you believe me if I told you my life was at risk?

Dawn Destroyer:
I was under the impression that Lungmen was a city of law and order.

Mostima:
I'm just as curious as you are as to why random pedestrians would be after my head in such a well-policed city.

Mostima:
Okay, I might actually have a pretty good idea of why.

Mostima:
Go find a milk tea place, and get me a cup. See ya.

Dawn Destroyer:
Hey, what the hell's up with your––

Mostima:
Texas, you could say we're coworkers, right?

Texas:
More or less.

Mostima:
I don't think coworkers are supposed to draw swords on each other.

Texas:
But Exusiai's been looking for you this whole time.

Texas:
And you're a slippery one, so I figured it'd be easier to hogtie you and haul you over to her.

Mostima:
Oh, Siracusans. You always get the job done clean.

Mostima:
I have to admit, though, I was this close to letting you do it.

Mostima:
But at this point, you can't catch me anymore.

Texas:
Emperor talked to me about you. I never planned to take you on alone.

Mostima:
Hi there.

Exusiai:
Mostima?!

Texas:
Just happened to bump into her.

Exusiai:
Good going, Texas!

Texas:
Same plan as always. I'm up front, you wrap around.

Texas:
Tie her to a chair. I've got all sorts of ways to make her spill what you're looking for.

Mostima:
Siracusan ways?

Texas:
Texas ways.

Mostima:
El, you're not really going to fight me, are you?

Exusiai:
......

Exusiai:
Why not?

Exusiai:
The boss talks a lot about business culture. Even though his slogans change every day, I've always held onto one for myself––

Exusiai:
Play hard!

Exusiai:
So let's play, Mostima.

Mostima:
......

Mostima:
Alright, we'll play a little game of cops and robbers. If you can catch me, you win.

Exusiai:
Does it matter how I do it?

Mostima:
You can even smack me around, El. Use your gun if you'd like.

Exusiai:
Huh?

Mostima:
Don't worry, the commandments don't protect fallen angels.

Mostima:
Okay, let's dial up the difficulty a bit. You––

Texas:
I won't use my Arts.

Mostima:
But you're still going to use your swords, right?

Texas:
As long as you don't resist too much, you probably won't get hurt.

Exusiai:
Alrighty. Three–– (Winks)

Texas:
(Nods slightly)

Exusiai:
Start!

Exusiai:
She's fast!

Distant Mostima:
I know all your little tricks, El.

Exusiai:
Of course you do...

Exusiai:
Texas, have you eaten?

Texas:
Yes. How about you?

Exusiai:
I'll manage.

Texas:
Then let’s get going.

Exusiai:
Alrighty!

Croissant:
Ya seem mighty busy today, Exusiai.

Exusiai:
Eh, I'm okay, Croissant. You're setting a stall up over here?

Croissant:
Sure am. Didn't have much work today, so I figured I'd do a little hawkin'.

Exusiai:
Oh right, have you seen a blue-haired angel? I think I saw her linger here for a little while, from off in the distance.

Croissant:
If'n you mean that Mostima of yers, she went that-a-way.

Exusiai:
Alrighty, thanks a bunch.

Croissant:
That about satisfy ya?

Mostima:
And here I was thinking you'd double-cross me halfway through.

Croissant:
Y'all playin' some kinda game?

Mostima:
How'd you know?

Croissant:
Well, I reckon since you've been duckin' her this long, if'n you didn't want her to find you, Exusiai'd never see heads or tails of ya.

Mostima:
Then why didn't you help her?

Croissant:
Let's just say you've piqued my curiosity.

Croissant:
'Course, since I helped ya, ya gotta show my enterprise here a li'l love.

Mostima:
Then, I'll have a smoked sausage.

Croissant:
Now yer talkin'.

Mostima:
What do you want to get out of me?

Croissant:
Hmm... It's less gettin' somethin' outta ya, and more somethin' I wanted to tell ya.

Croissant:
Since she came here lookin' for ya, n' all the time she spent waitin' for ya, Exusiai's been in Lungmen for a good number of years now.

Croissant:
But I'n see that her search ain't no grave matter o' life n' death. Just look at what a whallopin' good time she's havin' in Lungmen!

Croissant:
She talks you up as some kinda unbelievably powerful being, carryin' a buncha secrets you can't tell nobody, haulin' a big pile of yer own problems on them shoulders fer good measure.

Croissant:
But it's been an awful long time. Ya do kinda owe her an explanation.

Mostima:
......

Texas:
Croissant, grab her.

Croissant:
Hey, I got a stall to run here.

Texas:
Fine. Good luck.

Mostima:
Game on, Texas.

Croissant:
The sausage is my treat then. When yer done with this li'l game, do remember to talk things out with her.

Mostima:
I'll think about it.

Mostima:
It actually started to rain.

Mostima:
Not a bad thing for someone trying to stay hidden.

Mostima:
Hm?

Sora:
Huh? A venue change?

Sora:
No way...

Sora:
But it's raining over here. I can't make it over right now!

Sora:
Find a way to make it happen?

Sora:
Hey, aren't you being a bit too unreasonable here––

Sora:
Hey!

Sora:
What a jerk! Treating me like this just because I'm an up-and-comer...

Sora:
Even if I hailed a cab, I wouldn't make it in time, and it's probably too late to call Texas... What should I do? Do I really have to throw in the towel?

Mostima:
You're Sora, right?

Sora:
Oh, um, yes, yes I am....

Sora:
Wait a sec, a blue-haired Sankta with horns... Are you Mostima, the one Exusiai's always looking for?

Mostima:
That's me.

Sora:
I have to tell her...

Mostima:
Aren't you kind of busy?

Sora:
Oh, I guess so.

Mostima:
I'm here to help.

Sora:
Huh?

Mostima:
Don't worry, I'll go to her.

Sora:
Really?

Mostima:
Really.

Sora:
Then please, I'm counting on you! The address is––

Mostima:
You can tell me on the way. Hold onto my hand.

Sora:
Oh, so you want to take the rooftops!

Sora:
Here is good.

Mostima:
Right.

Sora:
I can't believe I'm here ten minutes early.

Sora:
Thank you so much, Mostima... Um, ma'am.

Mostima:
No need for the ma'am now.

Sora:
But, why did you suddenly show up to help me?

Sora:
Haven't you been hiding from Exusiai this whole time?

Mostima:
Uhh...

Sora:
Wait, if you want to say something, you should be saying it to her, not me.

Mostima:
Right.

Sora:
Oh say, this whole time, there's been something I've wanted to ask you. Do you mind?

Mostima:
If it's a question I can answer, fire away.

Sora:
I want to know, are the Sankta... all as carefree as Exusiai?

Mostima:
Huh?

Mostima:
I guess, yeah, basically, most are.

Sora:
Hmm... Okay.

Sora:
I work as an idol. This might sound strange, but one of the most important parts of being an idol is figuring out how to read people's hearts.

Sora:
I've always believed that if you can open your heart to anyone, then you probably have more than one door into your heart.

Sora:
The people who seem nice to everyone must be hiding something deep inside.

Sora:
But I don't think that's true for Exusiai.

Sora:
Did you know, when Exusiai first joined Penguin Logistics, she was the absolute queen of troublemakers.

Sora:
She would believe pretty much anything anyone told her.

Sora:
I still remember that day, the day after she joined. The boss asked her to make a delivery so he could test her.

Sora:
Texas had some things to do, so I ended up being her contact.

Sora:
At first, I thought nothing would happen, but turns out...

Sora:
Basically, you got scammed!

Exusiai:
Huh? Is that what happened?

Sora:
Of course! In this line of business, it's pretty common for goods to not match up with the sheet on the clipboard, but for there to only be one thing is virtually unheard of.

Sora:
There must've been a mix-up.

Exusiai:
Oh, I see.

Sora:
I'm pretty sure what's going on here is they're spotting a newbie as a mark to take the fall and pushing the blame for the inevitable conflict onto Penguin Logistics.

Exusiai:
You're pretty smart, huh, Sora?

Exusiai:
Is there a way out of this?

Sora:
The simplest way is to find the gang leader who set you up and have him publicly come out to resolve the situation, but that would basically mean facing down the entire gang, so it's not like it's simple.

Exusiai:
Then let's give it a try.

Sora:
I just said, it's not that simple!

Sora:
Texas, when did you...?

Texas:
I heard a whisper on the wind, so I rushed over.

Texas:
Are you alright?

Sora:
Yes, but we're in kind of a pickle...

Texas:
You said you'd give it a try, but do you think you have a shot?

Exusiai:
No clue, but since I'm the one who messed up, I'll do what I can to set things right.

Texas:
Come with me.

Exusiai:
Alright.

Sora:
So what was supposed to be a simple delivery task turned into the two of them rushing headlong into the territory of a small gang, grabbing their leader, and resolving the incident.

Sora:
From that day on, Texas usually took Exusiai with her for all sorts of assignments.

Sora:
Texas taught Exusiai a lot of the rules and laws of the biz, the do's and don'ts, so on and so forth.

Sora:
And now, as you can see, they're good partners.

Mostima:
Does it feel like she snatched away your dear friend?

Sora:
Maybe a little. But it's more like I'm filled with a sense of awe.

Sora:
I just couldn't stop thinking to myself... Oh my gosh, how can a person like that be real?

Sora:
This might sound funny, but I actually ended up spending a lot of time trying to figure out what she was hiding and expose her.

Sora:
But the longer I searched, the clearer it became that Exusiai really is the same person on the inside that she is on the outside.

Sora:
I'm not sure when it happened, but she became my friend too.

Sora:
After talking to you today, I think the last little knot in my heart has been undone.

Sora:
Oh, I need to hurry up and see the manager. If you have time later, I'll take you out for cake!

Mostima:
Sounds good.

Mostima:
How about you? Have you ever suspected her?

Texas:
Nope.

Texas:
I'm not the type to guess at people like that.

Texas:
Whatever side people show me, I'll believe in it until they betray me.

Mostima:
That makes you pretty similar to El.

Exusiai:
What are we gossiping about?

Texas:
About whether or not you're a happy-go-lucky fool.

Exusiai:
What's there to talk about? Do you think I'm not?

Texas:
Look.

Mostima:
Haha, that's how she's always been, from the very beginning.

Exusiai:
Oh.

Exusiai:
Hold on a sec!

Mostima:
What is it?

Exusiai:
I just realized we're right by the place I'm supposed to make a delivery to.

Exusiai:
I almost forgot I was in the middle of a delivery when Texas called me over. I'll go take care of that real quick!

Exusiai:
So, let's take a halftime break! Wait for me!

Texas:
......

Mostima:
So, you're not gonna come at me?

Texas:
No, because you're taking your game with her seriously.

Mostima:
The bar over there looks pretty decent. How about it?

Texas:
Sure.

Mostima:
I've been thinking this whole time that you'd get along pretty well with a grumpy friend of mine.

Texas:
And I've realized after meeting you, that you really are the type of person she'd aspire to be.

Mostima:
The what?

Texas:
She's never said it before, but I know.

Texas:
The feeling of pinning the past onto someone, or clinging to something in the past... For some unpleasant reason, I understand that all too well.

Texas:
But you...

Texas:
For the person she is now, you represent the past she was chasing after, one that will only disrupt her present life.

Mostima:
So you really were planning to kill me.

Texas:
Sort of. I hope you die quietly in some ditch she doesn't know about.

Texas:
Or become an afterimage that she can never catch up to.

Mostima:
El's made some real good friends.

Exusiai:
Hey guys!

Exusiai:
I have good news and bad news. Which do you wanna hear first?

Texas:
The good news.

Exusiai:
Another delivery has been completed!

Texas:
I assume the bad news is you pissed off the recipient?

Exusiai:
You got it!

Hoodlum:
Stupid Sankta, you're dead!

Texas:
I wasn't done talking.

Texas:
I changed my mind.

Mostima:
Oh?

Texas:
If you were here just to play the good mentor, bending over to listen to the woes of your disciple because you happened to be in a good mood, I'd make you regret it.

Texas:
But that doesn't seem to be the case.

Mostima:
I can tell you on that one, that's definitely not why I'm here.

Exusiai:
Uhh, did I happen to walk in on a heavy conversation or something?

Exusiai:
Should I go deal with them myself?

Texas:
Nah, talk's over. I need some exercise anyway.

Hoodlum A:
Gah, they're too strong.

Hoodlum B:
L-Let's get outta here!

Exusiai:
Oh... I'm getting a bit tired.

Texas:
Want some chocolate?

Exusiai:
Sure do. Mostima, want some...?

Exusiai:
Huh? Where'd Mostima go?

Texas:
Looks like she slipped away during the scuffle.

Exusiai:
Aw, she Mostima'd...?

Texas:
There's a letter here. Looks like it's for you.

Exusiai:
For me? Huh, don't tell me she...

Exusiai:
No, hold on, it's from my sister!

Exusiai:
Oh, turns out Mostima came here to deliver this.

Exusiai:
But I guess this counts as her having handed it to me, right?

Texas:
......

Texas:
Read the damned thing first.

Exusiai:
How could I ever blame you...?

Exusiai:
......

Texas:
Your sister's a decent person.

Exusiai:
Of course! She's the best!

Emperor:
Ohhh, your big sis's comin' to Lungmen?

Exusiai:
Boss?! When'd you get here?

Texas:
He's been standing there behind the counter bartending this entire time.

Emperor:
I popped in right the precise moment y'all walked into this bar.

Croissant:
This ain't the wrong joint, is it?

Sora:
No, it's the right one. Look, it's them!

Exusiai:
What are you two doing here?

Croissant:
Baws called us on over.

Sora:
He dealt with that pesky manager, so I made my way over here.

Exusiai:
Boss, does that mean...

Emperor:
Damn right. We got a day worth celebrating, so I decided we throwin' a partaaaay!

Croissant:
What are we celebrating?

Emperor:
Exusiai's sis writin' her, what else?

Croissant:
Didn't you find out about that just now?!

Emperor:
Aaaaand, we gotta welcome back long-term expat staff, Mostima!

Sora:
That seems like a pretty good idea.

Exusiai:
But, Mostima...

Mostima:
You called?

Exusiai:
Woah! I thought you...

Mostima:
Just needed the washroom.

Mostima:
Your sister's my boss now. She told me to personally deliver that letter to you under pain of death.

Exusiai:
Ehh... You don't plan on quitting, do you?

Mostima:
Wanna guess if I've talked about it?

Exusiai:
There's no way she'd let you, haha!

Emperor:
Aight, move your asses! Booze, ambience, tunes! Everything's on the Penguin Logistics house tonight!

Penguin Logistics Staff:
Woohoo!

Croissant:
What can I get'cha?

Texas:
Chocolate. Coffee.

Sora:
Cake!

Exusiai:
Pizza, and BBQ!

Croissant:
This here's a bar, ladies! A bar!

Croissant:
Forget it. Askin' y'all's a waste of time. S'pose I'll look in back and see what got here. Just hafta make do.

Sora:
Oh, right, I can sing my brand-new song here tonight! You all hyped?

Exusiai:
Is it the same song you asked me to hear that one time?

Sora:
That's right! Even Texas has never heard it before!

Exusiai:
Oh, that song's a bit too mushy and romantic. Not my slice of apple pie!

Sora:
That means I'm doing something right! Your tastes are way too flashy. If you don't like my ballad, that means I've got the right feel down!

Exusiai:
Ehh? Why are you singing love songs at a party? We need something to get the blood pumping!

Texas:
I'll go check if that gang is out for any more trouble.

Exusiai:
Oh... I'll go with you too, since it was my fault to begin with.

Texas:
Nah, that's alright. I'll be right back.

Emperor:
Texas, grab some booze on your way back. The piss they got here ain't fit for me.

Texas:
Sure.

Mostima:
Anything you want me to do, since I'm technically still an employee of Penguin Logistics?

Emperor:
Uhh... Too bad, but nah!

Emperor:
What if you had a talk with the old fella in your stick there and got us a li'l show, a song and dance act or somethin'.

Mostima:
That'd be kinda hard on me.

Exusiai:
Mostima.

Mostima:
Huh?

Exusiai:
Do you know what the letter said?

Mostima:
Nope, but I can probably guess.

Mostima:
In my position, I'm not exactly qualified to offer any advice, but––

Mostima:
You have a good group of friends here. Don't you think, El?

Exusiai:
Mhm.

Croissant:
I could use a hand 'er two back here. Anybody––

Mostima:
Coming.

Exusiai:
......

Exusiai:
(Look, sis. This is the kind of life we lead now.)

Exusiai:
(Even though I should maybe blame you and Mostima for avoiding me, it's because of you two that I was able to make so many friends and find this wonderful life.)

Exusiai:
(I really love how things are going now.)

Exusiai:
(You're right about one thing.)

Exusiai:
(I've lived in Lungmen for a long time. My life has gradually shifted away from chasing the past, into spending every day with my partners here at Penguin Logistics.)

Exusiai:
(But really, that isn't quite true either.)

Exusiai:
(My experience has taught me that I want more than just a carefree life with the people around me.)

Exusiai:
(Texas has her past to deal with, Croissant dreams of being an entrepreneur, and Sora will also step onto a bigger stage one day.)

Exusiai:
(And they all know that I've never given up on chasing after you two.)

Exusiai:
(There's no such thing as an endless party. But I figure none of us are actually afraid of that.)

Exusiai:
(After all, being the best of friends doesn't mean that we're living lives indistinguishable from each other.)

Exusiai:
(What it means is that no matter where we go, we'll still look out for one another.)

Exusiai:
(So by the time you come to find me, you might be in for a big surprise.)

Exusiai:
(After all, I'm sure I'll give you a very firm answer––)

Emperor:
What'cha spacin' out for, Exusiai?

Emperor:
Get over here and help me PUMP IT UP!

Exusiai:
Coming!

Exusiai:
Come one, come all. All the friends who've crossed our paths, all the unlucky fools who've crossed us. Let us all enjoy some––

Exusiai:
Apple pie!
