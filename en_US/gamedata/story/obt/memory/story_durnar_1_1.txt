Dur-nar:
Nice work, my A1 newbies.

Dur-nar:
That wraps up your regular training for the day!

Dur-nar:
Congrats!

Dur-nar:
You know, when you guys first got here, you'd be dead on the ground after just an hour or so.

Dur-nar:
Look at you now. None of you are even winded.

Dur-nar:
Just goes to show that the training did its job.

Beagle:
Hehe, thanks, Instructor.

Fang:
Beagle, the instructor hasn't finished yet! How could you—

Dur-nar:
It's fine, Fang. I'm not Dobermann. No need to follow the rules to a tee.

Dur-nar:
Everyone's exhausted after all that training. Let's take it easy. Okay?

Fang:
Instructor!

Dur-nar:
You know, you're starting to sound more and more like Dobermann.

Fang:
Right! —Wait, am I?

Dur-nar:
Look at you. If you stand up straight, put your hands on your hips, and stare straight into my eyes, it's like you're the spitting image of Dobermann.

Dur-nar:
And the way you talk... I guess I needn't say anymore.

Fang:
Oh...

Kroos:
She's right. You're exactly like her~

Dur-nar:
It's a good thing, though.

Dur-nar:
It's not like back when I was in the army. Rhodes Island has a decent team of instructors who provide all reserve operators adequate training, and each of them has their specialty.

Dur-nar:
Anything that I miss, they'll notice and give you guys a lesson on that, and vice versa.

Dur-nar:
That way, rather than leaving our reserve operators' lessons to the whim of some random person, you all receive fairly comprehensive training.

Dur-nar:
Grace, Fallon, Dobermann, and all the rest.

Dur-nar:
You can always count on them to teach you what you need to know, and have your back in a fight.

Dur-nar:
Fang.

Fang:
Instructor!

Dur-nar:
Do your best to learn everything you can from Dobermann, okay? We wouldn't mind having a TA.

Fang:
Of course, Instructor. Thank you, Instructor!

Dur-nar:
Also, remind me to find the groundskeeper to fix this place up after we're done training.

Dur-nar:
I forgot to do it before, and Dobermann tore me a new one each and every time. *Sigh*...

Dur-nar:
Okay, Fang? Be sure to remind me.

Fang:
Yes, Instructor!

Dur-nar:
Thanks.

Dur-nar:
Okay, enough chit-chat.

Dur-nar:
Everyone—

Dur-nar:
Attennnnn-tion!

Dur-nar:
As you know, that wraps up our regular training for the day.

Dur-nar:
Though we still have some time left.

Dur-nar:
And with it, I want to have a little combat drill with everyone!

Fang:
*Gasps*

Beagle:
Eh?!

Dur-nar:
Some of us here haven't been in a drill before, so I'll briefly explain what we'll be doing.

Beagle:
(Oh no, we're so done for!)

Lava:
?

Dur-nar:
It may sound kind of fancy, but all we are doing is simulated combat. I will evaluate your combat styles and tell you how you could improve.

Lava:
(Whispers) Hey, Hibiscus, look at Beagle.

Hibiscus:
(Whispers) Quiet down. Wait till the instructor is done.

Dur-nar:
Oh, of course, this is going to be a little different than your usual fights.

Dur-nar:
Mmmhm... you're all here. Let's make this a one-on-five.

Dur-nar:
I wanted to see the results of your training and check how well all of you could work with each other anyway.

Dur-nar:
Okay, let's take a break first. Relax, eat some candy or whatever. I'll get some preparations done.

Dur-nar:
Dismissed!

Beagle:
Fang!

Fang:
Huh?

Beagle:
What should we do?!

Fang:
I-I don't know!

Kroos:
You should relax~ It's not Dobermann we're up against.

Beagle:
Instructor Dur-nar isn't that usually scary, b-but... it's a different story if we're going to be fighting her!

Lava:
What do you mean?

Beagle:
You know how Instructor Dur-nar does drills with the Guard, Defender, and Vanguard operators, Lava?

Lava:
Yeah, what about it?

Beagle:
Do you know what she does during those matches?

Lava:
How bad could it be...?

Beagle:
Last time, she set her shield down and bludgeoned me with two swords for a whole hour!

Beagle:
And she was as fast as the wind!

Fang:
Oh, yeah...

Fang:
I used to think of her as a really friendly person. She doesn't yell at us that much, and she treats us to some really tasty food.

Fang:
It wasn't until I fought her for the first time that I found out... Once she starts walloping you, Instructor Dur-nar can be much worse than Instructor Dobermann. I could barely hold my lance up.

Fang:
And you've seen her shield arm, right? When she drops the shield and picks up a sword, she can really strike like lightning.

Kroos:
Oh, yeah, I think I know what you mean now. It's just like that time when I was in a shooting match against Meteor at the training grounds, right?

Lava:
Whoa, against Meteor...?

Lava:
That's something, Kroos.

Kroos:
Hehe, she landed five training shots on me in just one minute.

Lava:
Wow... so lame...

Kroos:
Hehe.

Fang:
Anyway, if you don't want the living daylights beat out of you, be sure to never, ever underestimate Instructor Dur-nar.

Fang:
She's a seasoned vet, and she'd still be in active service if she wasn't disillusioned with the Columbian army.

Fang:
If she brings another sword, we're as good as dead—

Fang:
Hm...

Fang:
Hey, Hibiscus? Did anyone go to Medical today to get some ointment or something for flesh wounds?

Hibiscus:
Hm?

Hibiscus:
We get a lot of visitors to the Medical Department every day. I guess you could say scratches and bruises are a dime a dozen there?

Fang:
Hibiscus, this is important. Work with me here.

Hibiscus:
Uhh...

Hibiscus:
I was redressing a patient's wound at the ward today. I wasn't in the clinic.

Hibiscus:
But I heard this from Sussurro.

Beagle:
What did she say?

Hibiscus:
Apparently everyone from A4 paid us a visit to get their wounds treated after their training this morning.

Hibiscus:
Yeah, and it was Instructor Dur-nar who brought them there.

Hibiscus:
Does that have something to do with this?

Beagle:
Of course!

Fang:
I can't believe not even Melantha and Cardigan could stop her...

Lava:
She might make short work of you guys one on one, but there's five of us.

Hibiscus:
There's five of them in A4 too...

Lava:
W-What about it? We're much stronger than A4.

Lava:
Right, Fang?

Fang:
Uh... Uhh... Right...

Fang:
I believe in us...

Beagle:
We can do it! We can...

Lava:
It sounds like you guys aren't that confident. Is she really that scary?

Dur-nar:
Okay, everyone—

Beagle:
She's here!

Dur-nar:
Line up!

Everyone:
Yes, Instructor!

Dur-nar:
Yeah, looks like you're all ready. Excellent.

Kroos:
Instructor, may I ask a question?

Fang:
(Kroos!)

Dur-nar:
Ask away.

Kroos:
Why did you bring an extra practice sword?

Dur-nar:
Come on, isn't it obvious? It's for our training, of course.

Dur-nar:
Man, during the break, I suddenly remembered a combat technique I used back in the day. I really want to try it out on someone.

Dur-nar:
Oh, of course, I'll be using the same stuff as all of you. Regular training equipment, not those electric swords I modified.

Dur-nar:
You'd better take it serious. Just because I'm not usually that hard on you guys doesn't mean I'll go easy when we're doing this for real.

Dur-nar:
If you don't want me to wipe the floor with you, then face me.

Dur-nar:
Have you read up on the steps to intercepting the enemy? It's in your training handbook.

Everyone:
Of course!

Dur-nar:
Good.

Dur-nar:
When we start off, we'll be facing each other, but we'll use the whole field after that.

Dur-nar:
Hm?

Dur-nar:
What are you spacing out for? Shouldn't you be more alert with an enemy right in front of you?

Fang:
Uh, yes!

Fang:
Stay alert!

Dur-nar:
Yep, that's more like it.

Dur-nar:
Since this is our first battle, I'll let you girls attack first.

Dur-nar:
Make sure to work with each other. If you aren't careful, it's going to be no different from me taking all of you on one by one.

Dur-nar:
Is that understood?

Everyone:
Understood!

Dur-nar:
Let's get started, then.

Fang:
......

Fang:
Beagle, keep an eye on her...

Beagle:
Hm...

Fang:
Lava, Kroos, get ready...

Kroos:
Okay~

Lava:
Don't have to tell me twice!

Fang:
Hibiscus, I'm counting on you to heal us up. Beagle has more pressure, so prioritize her.

Hibiscus:
Understood.

Fang:
Ready—

Fang:
Go!

Dur-nar:
Too slow!

Beagle:
Uagh!

Fang:
Oh no!

Kroos:
!

Dur-nar:
Hmph.

Fang:
Beagle, push her back!

Beagle:
I'm trying!

Fang:
Everyone, keep your eyes on her! As long as we got eyes on her, she doesn't stand a chance!

Lava:
Take this!

Beagle:
Wah!

Fang:
What the—?!

Lava:
Ah, crap!!

Dur-nar:
Hmph!

Beagle:
Agh!

Fang:
What's the matter, Lava?!

Fang:
No!

Dur-nar:
Heyah!

Fang:
Mmph!

Lava:
Eh?

Lava:
Ugh...

Kroos:
I have a clear shot on her!

Hibiscus:
Uhh...

Lava:
Ugh...

Kroos:
Oh.

Kroos:
Instructor?

Kroos:
Gah...

Dur-nar:
......

Dur-nar:
Phew.

Dur-nar:
Stand up, all of you. I'll go over where you went wrong.

Everyone:
Yes, Instructor...

Fang:
Lava, we actually had a shot...

Lava:
My bad...

Lava:
But how was I supposed to know Beagle would be in the way?

Dur-nar:
Sounds like we found our problem.

Lava:
Y-Yes, Instructor!

Lava:
(So scary!)

Dur-nar:
It's true that there's not much height difference in the terrain here, and those in the back could easily injure your teammates.

Dur-nar:
Aside from that, Lava, your Originium Arts are not very suitable for a closed environment like this.

Lava:
Y-Yes, of course.

Dur-nar:
In a situation like this, you could've cast your Arts behind me to limit my movement.

Lava:
Uhh—

Dur-nar:
Your teammates were already taking me on face to face.

Dur-nar:
So why focus your Arts on me?

Lava:
*Whimpers*...

Dur-nar:
Beagle.

Beagle:
Yes!

Beagle:
(Guess I'm getting an earful...)

Dur-nar:
You still haven't solved that problem we talked about.

Beagle:
Right...

Dur-nar:
*Sigh*...

Dur-nar:
It's more stable now.

Dur-nar:
But not enough.

Dur-nar:
Cardigan really likes to rock around when she's on defense. It may create more openings, but that trick is never going to work on her.

Dur-nar:
I know you fight like that because you want to play it safe, but when you can't play it safe enough to fend off disruptions, you need to use your techniques to make up for it.

Dur-nar:
Come here.

Beagle:
Alright.

Dur-nar:
Shield up.

Beagle:
Shield up!

Dur-nar:
Do you remember what I did just now?

Beagle:
You blocked my attack and slammed my shield, and that led me into the path of Lava's Arts.

Dur-nar:
If Fang had been faster, she could've pushed me back before I rammed into you.

Dur-nar:
Just like what Kroos did the first time.

Fang:
Sorry...

Dur-nar:
If you want to take my blow by yourself, however, there are three ways you can go about it.

Dur-nar:
One, come up with a way to counter the attack and dodge it.

Dur-nar:
This will expose your teammates to the enemy for a moment, but if you manage to take the chance and strike, you can quickly return to your defensive position.

Dur-nar:
Two, bear the impact with your shield.

Dur-nar:
Your shield is a weapon too. Right when you are about to be rammed, you can use your shield to attack.

Dur-nar:
Though you must also keep your eyes on your opponent. Don't stagger forward. You'd be giving the enemy a chance to attack your teammates or yourself when you have your back open.

Dur-nar:
Three, deflect the attack.

Dur-nar:
You know why I knocked you back into the path of Lava's Arts? Because you were basically begging me to do it, with your stance and your balance.

Dur-nar:
If your defense stance was like this instead...

Dur-nar:
Haah!

Beagle:
Agh!

Beagle:
Hm...

Beagle:
Hm?

Dur-nar:
See?

Dur-nar:
You still stepped back, but that doesn't affect Lava or Kroos's attack path in any way.

Beagle:
Yeah!

Dur-nar:
Good. You should get this down.

Beagle:
Okay, Instructor!

Dur-nar:
Fang.

Fang:
Yes, Instructor!!

Dur-nar:
You're the team captain. Your job is to command everyone else.

Fang:
Yes, Instructor!!

Dur-nar:
Tell me. How do you confirm your teammate's situations?

Fang:
By feel and observation.

Dur-nar:
Observation? How do you observe?

Fang:
I-I use my eyes...

Dur-nar:
You look back to check on your friends. Do you think your enemies will just let this chance slip by?

Fang:
I... I don't think so.

Dur-nar:
Did you guys base your positions on your basic coursework's textbook?

Fang:
Yes, Instructor.

Fang:
We don't follow it strictly, though.

Dur-nar:
The battlefield is a place of chaos. Doing everything by the book is how mistakes happen.

Dur-nar:
Let's see.

Dur-nar:
Hibiscus.

Hibiscus:
Yes, Instructor!

Dur-nar:
You need to take on some of Fang's responsibilities. Is that okay?

Hibiscus:
Ah, yes!

Hibiscus:
But what exactly should I do?

Dur-nar:
Fang needs eyes in the back of her head, and that's where you come in.

Dur-nar:
If you, Lava, and Kroos change your positioning, you need to tell Fang.

Dur-nar:
If anything in the environment around you changes, you need to tell her immediately, especially if it happens behind her.

Dur-nar:
And if Fang is incapacitated, it falls on you to lead the team.

Dur-nar:
Can you do that?

Hibiscus:
Yes, Instructor! I'll try!

Dur-nar:
Okay.

Dur-nar:
Kroos.

Kroos:
My bad. I'm so sorry~

Dur-nar:
......

Kroos:
I shouldn't have shot at Hibiscus.

Dur-nar:
I'm not too familiar with what exactly ranged operators do, so I'm not going to say much.

Dur-nar:
If we just look at how well you work with your teammates, you're doing pretty well.

Kroos:
Cheers~

Dur-nar:
Mind telling me how you're doing in the shooting practice matches just so I get a rough idea?

Kroos:
Meteor is usually my teacher there. She always takes me down in no time~

Fang:
Kroos, be serious...

Dur-nar:
Meteor—

Dur-nar:
Hm...

Dur-nar:
Okay, okay, I get it.

Dur-nar:
Alright, people, cheer up.

Dur-nar:
It's only been a few minutes.

Dur-nar:
We'll be using the training grounds' obstacles next.

Dur-nar:
This is a battlefield, and your enemies on the battlefield won't go easy on you.

Dur-nar:
I hope all of you, maybe I, will get to live for a few seconds longer.

Dur-nar:
Let's all do our best, girls.

An hour later.

Fang:
*Pant*... *pant*...

Dur-nar:
Well, looks like I still have it in me. Awesome.

Dur-nar:
Yep, and right on time. That concludes our training for today.

Dur-nar:
Congrats, everyone!

Dur-nar:
......

Dur-nar:
Why aren't you clapping?

Beagle:
S-Sorry, Instructor...

Dur-nar:
Alright, how about I treat all of you to something tasty?

Dur-nar:
Maybe some lap cheong?

Dur-nar:
I got some lap cheong imported straight from Yan, marinated in the finest sauces. It's got to be the sweetest and most fragrant thing ever.

Lava:
Oh, that sounds so tasty!

Hibiscus:
It sounds really greasy...

Dur-nar:
But before that, I need to take you to Medical.

Dur-nar:
So that we can both learn where your limits lie.

Beagle:
So Cardigan and the gang didn't get sent to Medical because of you. I was so scared...

Dur-nar:
Of course it wasn't me.

Dur-nar:
I'm not sure about anyone else, but I've got my ways to deal with you girls. I wasn't a soldier all those years for nothing.

Dur-nar:
I had it figured out a long time ago what exactly to prioritize.

Dur-nar:
That said.

Dur-nar:
Know that a lot of actual blood and sweat, even the lives of some of my friends, went into these techniques I'm teaching you.

Dur-nar:
If I find out you don't have this etched into your brains, I'll bring my electric blade the next time I spar.

Dur-nar:
Is that understood?!

Everyone:
Y-Yes, Instructor!

Dur-nar:
Okay, let's get going, then. We'll get a bite to eat once you're done with your checkups.

Everyone:
Okay!

Fang:
(I think I forgot about something...)

Fang:
(What did she want me to do again?)

Dur-nar:
Fang, you like spicy, sour stuff?

Fang:
Y-Yes!

Dur-nar:
You see, I got these snacks—

Fang:
Yes, thank you, Instructor!

Dur-nar:
Class's over. Stop calling me 'Instructor.'

Fang:
Sorry about that, Dur-nar...

Dobermann:
......

Dobermann:
Perfect timing. You manage the training grounds here, right?

Logistics Operator:
Y-Yes, Instructor Dobermann. What's the matter?

Dobermann:
Looks like Dur-nar and her team wrecked some of the equipment and obstacles while they were using this place. My guess is they had a pretty intense sparring match.

Dobermann:
Help me fix it up. I'll be training with some reserve operators later tonight.

Logistics Operator:
Yes, of course. Right away.

Dobermann:
Thanks.
