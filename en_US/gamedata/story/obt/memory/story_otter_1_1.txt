Rhodes Island Landship

'Lutra Workshop'

Mayer:
Ooh, looks like it's about time. Gotta get to work now.

Mayer:
Lemme see the schedule for today.

Mayer:
Mmm...

Mayer:
Mmyeah, works for me.

Mayer:
Let's get around to Maggy's 'Improvement proposals for Drone Dragonfly operation' and polish off my submissions for today. Get around to the rest later. Then I just gotta wait for her.

Mayer:
Doing maintenance on Saria's armor? Main thing should be giving it a new coat of paint... crap, did I not order paint?!

Mayer:
Arghh—we're good, we're good. Didn't use it up last time.

Mayer:
Main focus for today'll be that.

Mayer:
If I get the time, I'll send some orders for a couple new parts. Then I can give all my frontline Meeboos some real maintenance.

Mayer:
Mm-hm. Today's lineup, sorted.

Mayer:
Let's kick it off!

???:
Mayer!

???:
Mayer, open the door!

???:
It's urgent!

Mayer:
Not too happy about Saria's suit here...

Mayer:
Wonder why it can't charge up properly.

Mayer:
Weird. C'mon, where's the problem, officer?

???:
Mayer! I know you're in there!

???:
I hear you talking!

Mayer:
Rooound here?

Mayer:
Ah-hah~ Gotcha.

Mayer:
Prime suspect found. We're on Easy Street now.

???:
Don't make me do it!

Mayer:
Just need to restore a failed node, and the whole suit should be back up and working again.

Mayer:
Uh-huh. Optimize charge circuits first. Paint over next. You'll be back to regular service in no time.

Mayer:
D'you want some extra features while I'm at it? Hmm.

???:
Ugh. I don't know if Kal'tsit's gonna chew me out for abusing privileges...

???:
Who cares. Your fault for acting deaf, Mayer.

???:
Mayer!

Mayer:
Settled.

Mayer:
Check over your nodes one more time. Gonna be a pain once the paint gets all in you.

???:
Working with earphones in? Aren't you worried someone's gonna spook you?

???:
Mmm...

???:
Hm-hmm—

???:
(Claps Mayer's shoulder)

Mayer:
(Opens mouth and bites)

???:
Waaagghahagh!!!

???:
Ow, ow!

???:
Let go of me, damnit, let go of me!!

???:
I'm a BAD meal!

???:
You really blew it, Mayer. I had something good for you, and you wouldn't even open the door for me. Plus, you bit me...

Mayer:
Sorry, Closure. But, like, you know I bite when someone interrupts my work.

Closure:
Owwieeee.

Mayer:
Fine, I'll let you bite me too, then. Fair's fair?

Closure:
You're applying anti-Originium paint to a suit right now, I see?

Mayer:
Sure am.

Closure:
Pass, then. I bite you here and one moment later I'll be in Medical. Not worth it.

Mayer:
Eh, I guess you're not wrong.

Mayer:
Mmm...

Mayer:
Closure?

Closure:
What's up?

Mayer:
The door's stuck open.

Mayer:
I specifically remember setting it up to automatically open and close. Pretty sure I also set it a moment ago to 'do not disturb.'

Mayer:
Did you just hack my door?

Closure:
Uhh—

Closure:
No way~~ It was like that when I walked in.

Closure:
Your door just wasn't locked.

Mayer:
Didn't I lock it?

Mayer:
...Weird.

Mayer:
Can you gimme a moment? I'll check the tapes.

Closure:
!

Closure:
You put a camera up?!

Mayer:
I got a lotta sensitive Rhine material in here, y'know? It'd be bad news for all of us if I lost something.

Mayer:
Gotta take basic security measures.

Closure:
Nah, you should get back to work for now...

Closure:
R—Remember your health and safety regs. This paint's, uh, pretty dangerous, yeah? Things could go wrong with you trying to multitask!

Mayer:
It's fine, I've got mechanical arms on it.

Mayer:
Hmm, which program was it again?

Closure:
Er, Mayer, don't you think this paint's gonna go volatile soon?

Mayer:
?

Mayer:
That paint? It's fine, sheesh. It's inert.

Mayer:
You could dump it in boiling water and ionize it for three hours, freeze it, and it'd still be good to go the moment it thaws.

Mayer:
Is this the folder?

Mayer:
OK, monitor program, on.

Closure:
!

Mayer:
Time seek to—

Closure:
Mayer!

Closure:
Let's make smart robots together!

Mayer:
——

Closure:
Mayer?

Mayer:
——!

Closure:
M—Mayer?

Mayer:
What did you just say?

Mayer:
Could—Could you repeat that?

Closure:
Make some smart robots with me?

Mayer:
Sure!

Closure:
Then let's work specifics somewh—

Mayer:
(Presses monitor feed transmission toggle)

Bzzzz—

Monitor Feed:
(Sound of door opening)

Monitor Feed:
Ugh. I don't know if Kal'tsit's gonna chew me out for abusing privileges...

Monitor Feed:
Who cares. Your fault for acting deaf, Mayer.

Mayer:
......

Closure:
......

Mayer:
Meeboos.

Mayer:
Get her ass.

Meeboos:
——

Closure:
AaaaghhI'msorryit'smyfault don't sic the Meeboos on me ow ow ow ow waaaghhhhh!!!

Mayer:
Yeah, go on. What was it you wanted me for?

Closure:
Uwaaahh...

Closure:
I wanted you to help me with an explosive-type thingy...

Closure:
Underlying machine's a Raythean Challenger Hellcat high-performance operation platform...

Closure:
Topside already has a custom-ordered full-thermal Arts impact generator...

Closure:
But it's not working a hundred percent perfect, so I need your help...

Closure:
Uwaaahh...

Mayer:
Yeah, okay.

Mayer:
Just take a sniff of this first.

Closure:
Okaaaayhhh...

Closure:
(Inhale)

Closure:
!

Closure:
I know this!

Closure:
(Takes a deep breath)

Mayer:
You better now?

Closure:
Hahhhh~~~~

Closure:
Better!

Closure:
Eheheheh. Thanks, Mayer.

Mayer:
We're not gonna get any business done with you bawling your eyes out.

Closure:
True that, heheh.

Mayer:
Still dunno why you love sniffing the refined lubricant I have in here...

Closure:
Well, 'cause it smells good, duh.

Mayer:
Guess Warfarin wasn't wrong. There's no blood in your veins, just machine oil.

Mayer:
Enough of that. Let's get real.

Closure:
Aye-aye.

Mayer:
You need me to refit the Raythean Challenger. Raise its attack power. Right?

Closure:
Also, self-defense, damage resist, and evac plans. After all, we're gonna put a smart little guy in there. Can't have it breaking after one use.

Mayer:
Then you came to the right person.

Mayer:
Now. My reward?

Closure:
Remember how there was a little hoard in the hangar? As long as you—

Mayer:
I'll take the job!

Closure:
Heheh. Let's get along, partner.

Mayer:
Gettin' along, gettin' along~

Mayer:
But, uh.

Closure:
What?

Mayer:
See the blackboard over there?

Closure:
Covered in sticky notes?

Mayer:
Yeah.

Mayer:
That's my schedule.

Mayer:
Even if as a rush job, your commission still lands bottom-right of the very last note.

Closure:
Uhh—

Closure:
Any way I can jump the queue?

Mayer:
No, sirree.

Closure:
So in other words, two months.

Mayer:
Work fast, it'll be fifty days.

Closure:
Huh?

Closure:
Do you really work that fast?!

Mayer:
Decently. Sometimes inspiration hits and the work's done.

Closure:
Er... I'll leave you to it, then...

Closure:
Good luck with work!

Mayer:
Hold it!

Closure:
Huh?

Mayer:
You format the door for me first. I need to do its settings over.

Mayer:
Also, strip your sys-op authority off it.

Mayer:
Right now. Straight away. Giddy up.

Closure:
Uhh—

Closure:
Awright...

Two hours later...

Mayer:
Just the laaast bit—

Ding dong!

Magallan:
Mayer, it's me.

Magallan:
Um...

Magallan:
Did you change the password? Is that why the door's not opening?

Mayer:
And that should be about done.

Mayer:
Huh? Someone at the door again?

Magallan:
It's me!

Mayer:
Maggy! The door's broken! Push the button on the side and come in!

Magallan:
Hi, you.

Mayer:
Heyo.

Mayer:
I'm still busy with something for Saria here. Can't lay out the carpet for you.

Mayer:
So, you need something from me?

Magallan:
I made a reservation.

Magallan:
Drone plans. Wondering how they're doing?

Mayer:
Huh... oh!

Mayer:
That. Already done.

Mayer:
Listed out some technical essentials, improvement proposals and required materials. Everything's in that file on the table there. You look through, and if it's all good, we can set up a new time to help you make some fitting parts.

Mayer:
If you've got issues with it, we'll have a meeting about it.

Magallan:
Rightie. Thanks, Mayer.

Magallan:
Which file on which table is it?

Mayer:
That one, that one.

Magallan:
Your mechanical arms are pointing at at least four different tables. How should I know which one?

Magallan:
Mayeeer—

Mayer:
Ahhh don't pull me! I'm still painting here!

Magallan:
You can leave paint and keep painting later. Help me find the files first, okay?

Magallan:
Mayeeeer~~

Mayer:
I get it.

Magallan:
Mm-hm. Thankies~

Mayer:
Mmn—it's this one.

Magallan:
Oh...

Magallan:
These are your expensed items for last month.

Mayer:
Oh, sorry. I meant this one.

Magallan:
Mmm...

Magallan:
Yep, that's it!

Magallan:
Thank you, Mayer!

Mayer:
Ain't no thang. Just what I oughta do.

Magallan:
Then I'll be heading out now. Bye-bye.

Magallan:
Ah.

Magallan:
I almost forgot the most important part!

Magallan:
Can I ask you what the time is right now?

Mayer:
Noon, right?

Magallan:
Afternoon already!

Magallan:
Mayer, have you eaten yet?

Mayer:
Huh? You mean me? I eat an energy bar and I'm fine.

Magallan:
That's no good!

Magallan:
Here, take this!

Mayer:
This is?

Magallan:
I bought it at the cafeteria. They had the freshwater stuff you love today.

Magallan:
I wanted you to come eat with me, but then I lost track of time myself...

Magallan:
So after I finished eating, I got a portion bagged up to bring over.

Mayer:
Ooh, thanks.

Magallan:
Make sure you eat it.

Mayer:
Mm-hm, I will.

Magallan:
......

Mayer:
Anything else?

Magallan:
Is this Saria's Charged Suit?

Mayer:
That it is.

Magallan:
How much longer will you be working?

Mayer:
An hour or two-ish.

Magallan:
Well, that's no good. Let me help you out there.

Mayer:
It's fine, I can do it.

Magallan:
Either you let me help you, or I feed you your meal. Pick one.

Mayer:
Ugh...

Mayer:
Alright fine I get it! Give me a hand.

Magallan:
Hehe~

Magallan:
Then let's get to work~

Mayer:
Phew. We're done.

Magallan:
Good work.

Mayer:
C'mere and wash your hands.

Magallan:
Alright—

Mayer:
*Sigh*... It's only times like these I miss all of Rhine's self-cleaning facilities.

Magallan:
So why don't you go back?

Mayer:
If I went back, they'd set me up with a mountain of annoying work, and I'd have no time to improve my Meeboos.

Mayer:
And, like, I had to deal with interpersonal stuff there too.

Magallan:
Like you don't have to here?

Mayer:
You're always out on fieldwork. You don't know all the politics and warring between sections.

Mayer:
Over there, right? You'd make a new friend one day, turn around, and bam, someone tells you 'they're from the blah-blah section, best you stay away from them.'

Mayer:
And what's worse is even if you're in the same section, sometimes your bosses are competing and you're all trying to drag each other down.

Mayer:
That's stuff I'm, like, just not good at dealing with.

Mayer:
So I ended up scarpering here.

Magallan:
I see...

Magallan:
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked you about...

Mayer:
It's okay...

Mayer:
Alright, let's eat.

Magallan:
Then I should be on my way.

Magallan:
Meeboos, can I ask you to keep an eye on her? Otherwise she'll go straight back to work the moment I'm gone.

Mayer:
My Meeboos don't have voice modules. They won't answer you.

Magallan:
I still have to nag you.

Magallan:
Okay then. This time I'm really off. Bye-bye.

Mayer:
Bye bye.

Mayer:
Hmm, maybe I should put those part orders through before I eat—

Mayer:
Whuah! What the hell are you doing, Meeboos?!

Meeboos:
——

Mayer:
It's just a little bit of work. I'm not gonna forget to eat.

Meeboos:
——

Mayer:
Ugh...

Mayer:
Fine, I get it, I'm eating, I'm eating now!

Mayer:
Phew, I'm stuffed. Alright, work!

Mayer:
Mmm, order parts first or fix some Meeboos first?

Meeboos:
——

Mayer:
Meeboos win out, yeah. Meeboos are more important.

Mayer:
C'mere.

Meeboos:
——

Mayer:
Lemme see—

Mayer:
Touch up paint, inspect wiring, update data, replenish energy.

Mayer:
That's what Meeboo maintenance is made of...

Mayer:
......

Mayer:
Better!

Mayer:
Still four more on mission duty, and my five reserve ones need servicing too.

Mayer:
What time is it, again?

Mayer:
Looks like I can get 'em done today.

Mayer:
Mmm...

Mayer:
Probably. Probably can.

Mayer:
As long as nobody else—

???:
Mayer! Open up!! Work needs you!

Mayer:
——————

Mayer:
Oh, c'mon, for fffff~!@~#!@...

Mayer:
*Huff*, *huff*.

Mayer:
Stay cool.

Mayer:
In—out, in—out.

Mayer:
Smile~

Mayer:
Alright.

???:
Whoa, so you're in.

???:
What's got you all smiles and rainbows?

Mayer:
You come here. I'll tell you.

???:
Sure—

Mayer:
See? This is a Meeboo.

???:
I know.

Mayer:
Stick your hand out. It's got something good for you.

???:
Huh, don't hear that every day. Wonder what it is?

Mayer:
Meeboo, get his ass.

Meeboos:
——!

???:
Aaaaarggh-don't-bite-me-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!!!

Late night

Mayer:
Ahhh—finally.

Mayer:
All done!

Mayer:
Everything I planned this morning is all done!

Meeboos:
——

Mayer:
Ahh—that doesn't count. I made the executive decision just now to move ordering parts to tomorrow.

Meeboos:
——

Mayer:
Lemme see what I gotta do tomorrow.

Mayer:
Go to the Procurement Department and order parts.

Mayer:
Need to install test equipment for Medical.

Mayer:
Oh, gotta debug my workbench again.

Mayer:
That should settle tomorrow's lineup.

Mayer:
Time is... 11:36.

Mayer:
Mm, yeah, I should crash.

Mayer:
Eat a bowl of instant noodles and then sleep.

Mayer:
See you tomorrow, Meeboos.

Meeboos:
——

Mayer:
Agh—ow, ow!
