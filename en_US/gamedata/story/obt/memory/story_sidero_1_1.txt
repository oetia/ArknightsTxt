Sideroca:
Hello? Can you hear me?

Sideroca:
Long time no see, Madame President!

Sideroca:
I heard you'll be visiting, so I took the liberty of reaching out. I hope you don't mind.

Sideroca:
Y-Yes.

Sideroca:
My parents' business is doing well, thanks to you.

Sideroca:
I'm sure you know. Those of us from Corinia tend to really think highly of that.

Sideroca:
Me?

Sideroca:
I'm prospering here, much thanks to you.

Sideroca:
Perhaps we could get a meal together soon?

Sideroca:
The day after tomorrow? Yes, of course!

Sideroca:
I'm always free! I'm just so happy to get to share a meal with you!

Sideroca:
Yes, okay.

Sideroca:
Something more modest? How about the cafeteria?

Sideroca:
Is the food at the cafeteria not to your liking?

Sideroca:
A private room? Isn't that a little too excessive?

Sideroca:
No, I'm sorry, that was thoughtless of me to say!

Sideroca:
Y-Yes, okay. I'll see you then.

Sideroca:
Thank you very much, Madame President.

Sideroca:
Bye.

Sideroca:
Phew.

Sideroca:
I've known her for so long, but she hasn't changed the slightest.

Sideroca:
On the other hand, all I've been doing is learning a bunch of random stuff.

Sideroca:
Hm?

Sideroca:
Did something happen over there?

Sideroca:
Dur-nar?!

Dur-nar:
Hm?

Dur-nar:
Hey there...

Bubble:
Let go! Let—go—of—me!

Dur-nar:
I'll let you go if you stop making a fuss.

Sideroca:
I thought you were out on a mission with Dobermann?

Dur-nar:
Well, about that.

Dur-nar:
I couldn't go because of... some personal issues, yeah.

Sideroca:
Could you help train me, in that case? Lately, I—

Dur-nar:
Sorry, but I got my hands full here.

Bubble:
Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go!

Sideroca:
If you need any help, please take me with you. I'm sure I can lend a hand. After that—

Dur-nar:
It's real private matters! Yup, as private as it gets, so thanks for the offer, but maybe another time!

Bubble:
Waagh—!

Dur-nar:
So, Bubble, you still want to draw on the Doctor's book?

Bubble:
Uhh...

Sideroca:
Is there something I can do to help?

Dur-nar:
What, help me with this little runt—?

Bubble:
Forte lady! Help! The instructor's bullying me!

Dur-nar:
We were running laps during training, and she thought it'd be cute to run all the way out here.

Sideroca:
Training? Is there training?!

Dur-nar:
We were, uh, playing a game. Right, a game!

Dur-nar:
I'm sure you know how much Bubble likes to run around when she's excited.

Dur-nar:
If I didn't grab her in time, there wouldn't be a wall next to you anymore

Dur-nar:
Hmm...

Sideroca:
Hm?

Bubble:
Mmmmmng!

Dur-nar:
......

Dur-nar:
!

Dur-nar:
Oh yeah, Sideroca, I have a favor I want to ask. Think you can hear me out?

Sideroca:
Please, go ahead.

Dur-nar:
You see how worked up Bubble is? She needs to let loose a little bit.

Dur-nar:
And you want someone to train with, don't you?

Sideroca:
That is true, but...

Dur-nar:
If you want to work on your strength, then Bubble is your best bet.

Dur-nar:
If we go by pure strength, not even the instructors are a match for her.

Bubble:
Exactly!

Dur-nar:
And since you can handle yourself pretty well, why don't you two train together a little, maybe teach her a few techniques too?

Dur-nar:
How about it?

Bubble:
Teach? I don't wanna.

Sideroca:
Of course. Could you make the arrangements for the training room?

Dur-nar:
Training Room No. 6. I talked to the guys there already. Just head in there.

Sideroca:
Okay.

Dur-nar:
I'm leaving Bubble to you for the day, then.

Dur-nar:
Have fun with your training!

Bubble:
......

Sideroca:
Hey there, Bubble? Why don't we head to the training room now?

Sideroca:
Waagh!

Bubble:
Wahhhh—!

Sideroca:
Stop! The training room's the other way!

Dur-nar:
Have fun!

Dur-nar:
......

Dur-nar:
Phew, that's two huge pains in my ass taken care of.

Dur-nar:
Sideroca looking after Bubble... I wonder how this will turn out.

45 minutes later...

Training Room No. 6.

Bubble:
You're a good runner, Forte lady.

Sideroca:
You not so bad yourself. You've got a lot of energy.

Bubble:
Hehe, I've run back and forth across all of Sargon.

Sideroca:
Really?

Bubble:
I'm super strong. Running around a bit ain't gonna stop me!

Sideroca:
Well, that's great.

Sideroca:
Hey, why don't we try to spar one-on-one?

Bubble:
What's that? Sounds boring.

Sideroca:
Just come right at me with all you've got.

Bubble:
I'll send you flying all the way across the room, though.

Sideroca:
Just give it a try. I think I can take it.

Bubble:
Okay.

Bubble:
Here I—go—!

Bubble:
Bam!

Sideroca:
Haah!

Sideroca:
I should've expected that from a Cerato.

Sideroca:
Heheh.

Bubble:
Hm?

Bubble:
Wait! Stop, stop stop!

Sideroca:
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

Bubble:
Nope.

Bubble:
That doesn't count!

Bubble:
I wasn't even really trying!

Sideroca:
Okay.

Sideroca:
Give it another go.

Bubble:
Hmph.

Bubble:
Maybe this far will do?

Bubble:
Hmm...

Bubble:
A little more.

Bubble:
Just—a little more.

Bubble:
Okay!

Bubble:
Don't cry if you can't block me!

Sideroca:
Okay.

Bubble:
Here I come, then.

Bubble:
Haaaaah— Wahhh—!

Bubble:
Fwooom!

Sideroca:
Hah!

Sideroca:
Wugh...

Bubble:
I'm the strongest! You can't beat me!

Sideroca:
Really?!

Bubble:
Nng!

Bubble:
Ah!

Sideroca:
Hiyaah!

Bubble:
No way!

Bubble:
You can't beat me!

Bubble:
Haah!

Bubble:
Ah... ahhh!

Bam!

Sideroca:
Aghh... hah... hah...

Sideroca:
Instructor Dur-nar was right. You're a formidable foe in a test of strength.

Bubble:
You beat me...

Bubble:
How come you're so strong?!

Sideroca:
Because I train a whole lot.

Sideroca:
If you get more exercise in, you'll definitely see the results.

Bubble:
You're lying.

Bubble:
I've been running around so much, but I haven't gotten any stronger.

Sideroca:
Maybe you aren't doing it the right way.

Bubble:
Hmm...

Bubble:
Are you as strong as Kay's big sister, Vulcan?

Sideroca:
Vulcan...? Probably not.

Sideroca:
Back in Minos, no one would dare to make an enemy of a blacksmith.

Bubble:
But you're really badass too.

Sideroca:
I need to get more training in. I need to get stronger.

Bubble:
I wanna be stronger too. I'll whoop Kay's ass and wipe the floor with her!

Sideroca:
You mean Ceobe?

Bubble:
Kay isn't very strong, but she puts up a really good fight!

Bubble:
I'll wipe the floor with her one day! Waahhh!

Sideroca:
Hehe, that sounds fun.

Bubble:
That's why I'm gonna train even more, and more!

Bubble:
C'mon, Forte lady! I know I can take you down!

Sideroca:
Okay! Since you're so fired up, I'll keep training with you for as long as I can!

Bubble:
Training!

Sideroca:
Training!!

Two hours later...

Bubble:
Forte lady, I... I'm so exhausted...

Sideroca:
What are you talking about? This is the perfect time to push yourself even further.

Sideroca:
Now is the time to really put your willpower to the test!

Sideroca:
Again!

Bubble:
W-We're really going again...?

Sideroca:
A true warrior will never fall on the battlefield.

Bubble:
Okay... Here I come...

Bubble:
Hmm...

*Thump*

Bubble:
I really... really can't move anymore...

Bubble:
Ugh...

Sideroca:
Too bad. Looks like you need to work on your endurance more.

Bubble:
I'm tired. I wanna go back to the dorm and head to bed...

Sideroca:
You can't.

Bubble:
Eh... Why...?

Sideroca:
Dur-nar told me to keep an eye on you the whole day, so you're my responsibility.

Sideroca:
If you go to bed now, then all that training will be for nothing.

Sideroca:
You need to get some exercise and stretches in to cool down. That will help you with the pain.

Bubble:
I still gotta move—?

Bubble:
Ugh—I don't wanna—I can't do it—

Bubble:
Wraaaaaaggghhhh!

Sideroca:
If you have time to cry, spar with me some more.

Bubble:
*Whimpers*...

Bubble:
I wanna go home and go to bed!

Sideroca:
Hey, you still got some strength left in you!

Sideroca:
Now stop running. Use the strength you have left where it actually matters!

......

Surveillance Camera:
......

Sideroca:
I lost her...

Sideroca:
I thought I'd have the advantage here, going by stamina and endurance...

Sideroca:
How come this always happens when I'm chasing people down?

Sideroca:
Hmm...

Sideroca:
Looks like those thirty lessons on tracking and trailing didn't pay off. I'll need to talk to the instructors about getting some more.

Sideroca:
Oh?

Sideroca:
Hey there, Suzuran.

Suzuran:
H-Hello, Sideroca.

Bubble:
(I'm counting on you and your big tails, Suzuran!)

Bubble:
(Don't let her see me!)

Suzuran:
(S-Stop it, Bubble! She'll see you!)

Sideroca:
Have you seen Bubble anywhere?

Suzuran:
N-No.

Sideroca:
Huh? That's weird. It's a dead-end here. Where did she go...?

Suzuran:
She might've climbed up the vents and escaped that way, haha...

Sideroca:
Hm, it's certainly possible with how small she is.

Bubble:
(Why is Suzuran wagging one of her tails?)

Bubble:
(Dad told me some people wags their tails when they lie. So it's true!)

Bubble:
(You're such a good friend, Suzuran!)

Bubble:
(But can't you stop wagging your tail in front of my nose? It tickles.)

Bubble:
(Crap!)

Bubble:
(A-Ahhh—)

Achoo!

Sideroca:
Hm?

Suzuran:
Ahh!

Suzuran:
(Don't grab my tail!)

Suzuran:
Sorry, Sideroca. I think I might've caught a cold.

Suzuran:
Achoo!

Sideroca:
That's a huge deal! Have you been to Medical yet?

Suzuran:
N-Not yet. I didn't want to give anyone any trouble.

Suzuran:
I was going to get a little rest and then go there myself.

Sideroca:
Now that won't do. I'll take you to see a doctor right now.

Suzuran:
It's okay, Sideroca. It's not a big deal. I feel okay. I'm fine by myself.

Suzuran:
(Takes out a handkerchief and rubs nose)

Sideroca:
Are you trying to save money?

Suzuran:
Eh? Eh?

Suzuran:
No, I'm not!

Sideroca:
Hmm...

Sideroca:
I see, so that's how it is.

Bubble:
(What's going on? Did she notice me?!)

Suzuran:
(Is there some misunderstanding here...?)

Sideroca:
I know how it feels, Suzuran. Where I am from, there are a lot of people who don't go to the doctor just to save a little money. Sadly, that's how a lot of them die.

Sideroca:
You're still young. That's not something you should have to worry about.

Sideroca:
If you can't afford to see the doctor, I'll pay for you.

Bubble:
(What is she talking about?)

Suzuran:
No, it's okay. Besides, Rhodes Island operators get free consultations... Eeep!

Bubble:
(Oh no. Oh no!)

Bubble:
(Can't see me, can't see me, can't see me!)

Sideroca:
It's all okay. I understand. I'll take you to Medical now.

Suzuran:
Eh? Eh?

Suzuran:
You got it wrong, Sideroca! My mom and dad send me money every month for my living expenses. They also send me pictures—

Suzuran:
Please! Listen to me—

Bubble:
P-Phew.

Bubble:
That was close. I've got Suzuran's big tails to thank.

Bubble:
Good job, Suzuran! I'll repay the favor!

That night.

Training Center Entrance.

Dur-nar:
So Bubble just disappeared after that?

Sideroca:
Yes...

Sideroca:
I couldn't find her after I took Suzuran to the clinic, so I thought I'd come to you...

Sideroca:
I'm sorry. This is all my fault, Instructor Dur-nar! I couldn't keep my eye on her.

Sideroca:
Please, punish me however you want!

Dur-nar:
No, no punishments...

Dur-nar:
I talked to the dorm staff already. Bubble is probably trying to get some rest there.

Dur-nar:
They said it's not normal for Bubble to be this well-behaved. We've got you to thank for that.

Sideroca:
Haha...

Dur-nar:
Thanks for your work today. If there's nothing else, you should head back and get some rest.

Sideroca:
......

Sideroca:
Actually, Instructor, there's something I wanted to ask.

Dur-nar:
Go ahead.

Sideroca:
How do you think I'm doing in the tracking and trailing courses?

Dur-nar:
You're doing fantastically. Excellent. Is there a problem?

Sideroca:
I've been thinking I'm not doing very well in this particular area. I'm always losing track of my targets.

Sideroca:
Are you sure I'm performing okay?

Dur-nar:
Ugh...

Dur-nar:
Those are just exceptions. Right, exceptions.

Dur-nar:
Our day-to-day environment is very different from the battlefield. I am sure there is nothing wrong with your ability to track enemies on the field.

Sideroca:
Really?

Dur-nar:
Yes, I'm sure of it.

Sideroca:
I'm very happy to hear that.

Dur-nar:
Yeah.

Sideroca:
In that case, would it be okay if I apply for courses that teach me how to track people down in our day-to-day living environments? I think this is a very important thing to learn.

Dur-nar:
Uh—Hm?

Dur-nar:
Oh, um... Well, about that.

Dur-nar:
It's getting late, so why don't you head home and get some rest? I'll talk to the other instructors about that over the next couple of days. I should have some good news for you later.

Sideroca:
Okay, Instructor. Thank you, Instructor! I'm heading back now!

Dur-nar:
Yeah, get home safe!

Dur-nar:
......

Dur-nar:
What do you think about that, Instructor Dobermann?

Dur-nar:
Looks like she's kind of figured it out already.

Dobermann:
We should still be able to handle it if we piece together a few cases.

Dur-nar:
We won't be as lucky next time.

Dobermann:
I'm certain we'll have a solution ready before this happens again.

Dobermann:
As long as she doesn't learn the most destructive tracking methods, then everything is still well in order.

Dur-nar:
If she actually learns that, though, forget the Doctor, none of us will get out alive.

Dobermann:
How about Bubble? Any improvement on that end?

Dur-nar:
I looked at the camera footage already.

Dur-nar:
You really should watch it yourself.

Dur-nar:
According to the dorm staff, Bubble has been holing up in her room the whole time, leaving only to shower. She didn't even come out for dinner; her roommate had to bring her her meal.

Dur-nar:
My guess is that just hearing the name Sideroca is going to send her shivering to no end for a good while.

Dobermann:
......

Sideroca:
Did you just say my name, Instructor?

Dur-nar/Dobermann:
?!

Dur-nar:
How come you're back?!

Sideroca:
Oh, you're here too, Instructor Dobermann. Are you finished with your field op already?

Dobermann:
Yeah... I was just looking at prospective sites around the landship.

Sideroca:
That's wonderful to hear. Actually, I came back because I wanted to ask something. Would it be okay if I get started with the course tomorrow?

Dobermann:
About that—

Dur-nar:
Let me talk it over with Instructor Dobermann first.

Dobermann:
(Whispers) Think of something to dodge the question. You're good at that, aren't you?

Dobermann:
(Whispers) Dur-nar?

Dur-nar:
(Whispers) I've actually talked to someone who knows Sideroca really well.

Dur-nar:
(Whispers) She's surprised about Sideroca's current condition, but she did give me some constructive advice.

Dur-nar:
(Whispers) She'll listen to me.

Dobermann:
(Whispers) Okay, I'm counting on you.

Dur-nar:
Sideroca.

Sideroca:
Yes!

Dur-nar:
Here's the deal.

Dur-nar:
I was actually just discussing that with Instructor Dobermann.

Dur-nar:
We don't think more training will satisfy your needs.

Dobermann:
(Whispers) Hey, what's the big idea?!

Dur-nar:
(Whispers) Just trust me this once!

Sideroca:
What do you mean...?

Dur-nar:
I know you sometimes work as the Doctor's bodyguard, and the Doctor slips away from you a lot.

Sideroca:
That's all my fault. I'm so sorry!

Sideroca:
That's why I need to—

Dur-nar:
That's why you need to help the Doctor out, manage some of those problems, am I right?

Sideroca:
You mean?

Dur-nar:
I'm sure you've noticed the Doctor hasn't been doing very well. Hardly ever getting enough sleep, and I've never seen anyone with worse eating habits. There's probably at least a tiny bit of chronic condition at work.

Dur-nar:
Rather than trying to improve your combat techniques, wouldn't you agree it's a much better idea to try to help the Doctor get better and healthier?

Sideroca:
I...

Dur-nar:
You should really think about what I just said. Good night, Sideroca.

Sideroca:
Good night... Instructor...

Dobermann:
(Whispers) Are all you Columbians always so... calculating?

Dur-nar:
(Whispers) It's called being smart.

Dur-nar:
(Whispers) Don't just stand there. Let's go!

Dobermann:
(Whispers) I-Is that really going to work?

Dur-nar:
(Whispers) At the very least, she's thinking about it. Let's get going!

Dur-nar:
(Whispers) If she starts talking about training again, we aren't going to get any sleep tonight!

Sideroca:
......

Sideroca:
She's right.

Sideroca:
I...

Sideroca:
I thought the Doctor needed just a bodyguard...

Sideroca:
But I got it all wrong.

Sideroca:
I thought all a bodyguard had to do was protect her employer.

Sideroca:
There is so much more that I can do, but the idea never even crossed my mind.

Sideroca:
Oh...

Sideroca:
Is that what the president meant?

Sideroca:
I may not be very demanding with what I eat, but eating better will improve my quality of life.

Sideroca:
The president's coming all the way here to Rhodes Island, and I invited her to a meal at the cafeteria.

Sideroca:
I really shouldn't have.

Sideroca:
The Doctor probably thinks so too.

Sideroca:
The Doctor's just too shy to talk to me about it.

Sideroca:
......

Sideroca:
I've made up my mind.

Sideroca:
I will save the Doctor.
