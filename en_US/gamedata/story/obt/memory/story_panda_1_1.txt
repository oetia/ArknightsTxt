A certain luxury apartment in Lungmen...

Answering Machine:
*Beep*—

Answering Machine:
You have—one—new message. Press play to listen.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
(Hits play)

Answering Machine:
Shêng-shêng, where have you been? I went everywhere, asked just about everyone. None of them said they saw you.

Answering Machine:
I was cheated too, y'know? I didn't expect that prick Sing to just take the money and split. I had a lot riding on that movie too. It's making my heart ache.

Answering Machine:
Shêng-shêng, listen to your Uncle Loeng. You shouldn't have put all your money in that project, no matter how much you loved the script.

Answering Machine:
Look where that got us. The movie's a bust. Everything down the drain.

Answering Machine:
*Sigh*, let's not talk about this anymore; I know this really bummed you out. Uncle Loeng has a few friends at the L.G.D. They'll do their best to work this case for us and get us our money back.

Answering Machine:
Don't let this get you down. Call me when you have time.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
(Hits the stop button)

Wan Shêng-shêng:
What a headache...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Well, shucks. That's all my savings gone!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
It was the crafty old codger who brought me on board. Well, alright, now that shit's hit the fan, it's like it's not his fault anymore.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Arghhhh—I'm so pissed!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
What do I do now?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Maybe I should just head on home and take over Dad's tanghulu stall... *Sigh*... Mom's not gonna be happy. All she ever wants is me promoting the family kung fu style.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
(Pulls hair) I'm in one heckuva pickle...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
(Opens the fridge)

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Beer... all gone. Whiskey... only a little left. Vodka... Finished it all.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Urgh, nothing to drown my sorrows with... Looks like I'll have to go downstairs for more.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
(Closes fridge)

*Clang*—

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Oww! That hurt!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
What's this...? Ugh... The can I tossed on the floor yesterday.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
(It's been days since I left home. It's such a mess in here... Maybe I should clean up after I get back.)

Wan Shêng-shêng:
(Gah, whatever... Maybe another time...)

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Hm, craft beer... get a twelve pack. Rum, huh? Been a while. Gotta take a bottle! Let's see what else... There's a nice looking vodka up there too...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
I can't reach it... Maybe if I jumped? Hmph!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Oh, crap, it's falling!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Ta-dah! Piece of cake.

???:
Th-That's amazing!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Uh, who are you?

Hapless Man:
Miss Shêng-shêng! It's you, Miss Shêng-shêng! It's really you!

Hapless Man:
I-I'm a fan of yours! I've seen every movie you were in. I watched every film in the 'Heavenedge Gallantry' trilogy multiple times. I-It's an honor to... to meet...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Uh... I'm not any Miss Shêng-shêng! You're mistaken. You got the wrong girl!

Hapless Man:
No way! The way you grabbed the bottle just now was exactly the same as that pose you did in 'Million LMD!' I saw that seven times! Couldn't be anyone else.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
That so? Haha. That one takes me back... like five or six years now...

Hapless Man:
Miss Shêng-shêng?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Aiyah... Anyway, you got the wrong girl. I'm checking out now!

Hapless Man:
Am I being a bother, Miss Shêng-shêng? Sorry. I-I didn't mean to.

Hapless Man:
I'm really sorry!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Eh, you... I... That's not what I meant... I just... *Sigh*... You want an autograph or something?

Hapless Man:
An autograph?! Really? Thank you very much! Let me find a piece of paper. Give me a minute.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Uh, you found anything yet?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
(This guy flipped through all his pockets already...)

Hapless Man:
I got it. I have this... dollar bill...

Hapless Man:
Uh, no... This...

Hapless Man:
*Sigh*... Miss Shêng-shêng, this bill, please. Please sign it for me.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Uhh—Fine, alright.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
(This dollar bill's all wrinkled up!)

Hapless Man:
Thank you, thank you so much!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You like kung fu stuff, huh? Just movies? Read any novels?

Hapless Man:
Of course, Miss Shêng-shêng. I've read all of Mr. Wong's greatest works, Qisi's short stories, and every issue of 'Monthly Wuxia' at the time!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You like Miss Qisi, huh? Everyone around me says her stories are too wordy, that they're a chore to read.

Hapless Man:
A chore to read? No way. Her writing's exquisite, and the stories are so moving they always bring tears to my eyes. All her works are masterpieces.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You're ex—actly right! None of those numbnuts know how to appreciate a masterpiece!

Hapless Man:
Miss Shêng-shêng, do you like Miss Qisi's books too?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Of course! 'The Assenting Fist' is my absolute favorite! The copy I have back home is falling apart from how many times I've read it!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Although...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Did you know?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
That novelette was going to be turned into a movie, until the actor who was going to play Yün Shêng was arrested for tax evasion. Then the producer took the money and skipped town, and that was the end of it.

Hapless Man:
*Sigh*... What a shame. Now we'll never see it!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You know what they say. Life is like a box of chocolates...

Hapless Man:
Hm... Now that's not right. Yün Shêng's an upstanding, heroic fella who would rather die an honorable death than deal with corrupt bigwigs. A noble character like him couldn't be played by an actor with no morals.

Hapless Man:
It's a good thing they cancelled that project. Haha.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Well...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You're right. That's right, haha. That's a good way to think of it, hahaha.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You're damned right. That guy's got a nasty disposition, can't act to save his life, and he's an idiot! Definitely not the right man for the job. I was so pissed when I heard he got the part.

Hapless Man:
Yeah, dodged a bolt there.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Oh, it's getting late. I need to head back soon.

Hapless Man:
I-I gotta go too, Miss Shêng-shêng. See you again. Uh, no, not quite right. We probably won't see each other again. Thanks for the autograph.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Uh, wait!

Hapless Man:
Hm?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Lady Zhang, the sands in Na-lan are ever roiling. It's a one-way trip. Will you ever make your way back here? Will we ever meet again?

Hapless Man:
Yün, one can only make one's way home if there is a home. We will meet if fate allows, but there is no telling what the world has in store for us. Take care.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Heh, you really love this book, don't ya?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
See you around!

The next day...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Agh... My head hurts. Hangovers suck... I shouldn't have had so much to drink last night. Urgh... I'm dying.

Shopkeeper:
Shêng-shêng, what's going on?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Hey, Lihua. Do you have any hot milk today? Skim? Get me a cup, will you?

Shopkeeper:
Sorry, Shêng-shêng, but I'm just about to close up and go home. Sorry that I can't help you.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You're closing? What's going on? Things looked alright when I was here yesterday.

Shopkeeper:
*Sigh*... We got robbed last night, and the thief knocked over a couple shelves when he ran away. The whole store was a mess. I only just finished cleaning up.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Oh, what about the thief? Did you catch him?

Shopkeeper:
Phew—He got caught alright. Bao caught him herself. She got hurt in the scuffle. Broke off a huge chunk of her horn.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Huh? Where's Bao now?!

Shopkeeper:
Slow down, Shêng-shêng. She's okay. She's just at the hospital to get some ointment for her horn. She'll be back.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Right, she can hold her own in a fight. That's an unlucky thief who runs into her. Oh, right, has anyone been asking about me?

Shopkeeper:
We've had a couple sketchy-looking reporters asking where you've been. I sent them on their way after I fed them some BS, just like Bao told me too.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
(Scratches head) Sorry for all the trouble. I'll take you guys out for a meal one of these days!

Shopkeeper:
It's thanks to you that Bao and I can put down roots here in Lungmen. It's the least we can do.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Hehe, lucky I get all my drinks here, right?

Shopkeeper:
That only goes so far... Oh, right, Shêng-shêng. Do you have all your things on you? Wallet, jewelry?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Got everything... I think. Why'd you ask?

Shopkeeper:
The thief talked to you for a while last night, so I was thinking... maybe he stole some of your stuff while you weren't paying attention.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Hehe, there can't be anyone stupid enough to steal from—

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Hold on. Who did you say it was?!

Shopkeeper:
Oh, it was that guy who struck up a conversation with you last night.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
What?! Him?!

Shopkeeper:
What's the matter, Shêng-shêng?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Uhh... Where is he right now?

Shopkeeper:
I-in an L.G.D. holding cell?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Sorry, gotta go—

Wan Shêng-shêng:
—See ya next time!

Shopkeeper:
Huh? Shêng-shêng!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You...

Hapless Man:
(Looks down) I...

L.G.D. Officer A:
Alright, kid, the young lady here's paying your fine. You can go now. Don't you ever steal again. Do better.

Hapless Man:
Of course, ah sir. Never again.

L.G.D. Officer A:
You should thank the lady.

Hapless Man:
Thank you...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You dick, why'd you do something like that?

Hapless Man:
I...

Hapless Man:
(Stomach growls)

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Whatever, let's get you something to eat first.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Ah sir, thanks for the help!

L.G.D. Officer A:
That voice... it sure was familiar. Where have I heard it before...?

L.G.D. Officer B:
How stupid are you? That's Miss Wan. Didn't you just watch 'L.G.D. Tales' last night?

L.G.D. Officer A:
What?! You mean that lady with the shades...

L.G.D. Officer B:
That's right. She's your favorite movie star, Wan Shêng-shêng.

L.G.D. Officer A:
How did I miss that?

L.G.D. Officer B:
Man, she's had it real tough lately, though. The movie she invested in didn't work out. She's probably going bankrupt.

L.G.D. Officer A:
How did that happen?

L.G.D. Officer B:
Sheesh, do you ever watch the news? It's been the talk of the town. Apparently the guy she was working ran into money problems, so he split and left her the mess to deal with.

L.G.D. Officer A:
Oh no. She must feel terrible.

Jaye:
Here's your big finballs. With radish and noodles. Enjoy.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Man, these are the best finballs I've ever had! I could eat these a thousand times, and I'd never get sick of them!

Jaye:
Haha, you're a big movie star, but you still come to our street stalls. You'd better watch out for the paparazzi. They're all laughing through their lenses.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Where's there to be afraid of? If they got a picture of me here, that's more business for you.

Jaye:
Forget it. I can't afford your endorsement fees. Eh, hey fella, not gonna eat?

Hapless Man:
I...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Just dig in. What are you so shy about?

Hapless Man:
Thanks, Miss Shêng-shêng.

Jaye:
You guys keep talking. I'll check the curry soup I'm cooking in the back.

Hapless Man:
So these are finballs. It's my first time trying them since I got to Lungmen. They're good!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
I here a lot. They say the guy who runs the stall used to be the boss of one of Lungmen's biggest gangs, and he started selling finballs after he retired from organized crime.

Hapless Man:
*cough*—*cough* *cough* *cough*...!

Jaye:
(Glances at them)

Jaye:
*Sigh*...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Hehe, just kidding.

Hapless Man:
*Cough*... *gulps*, I'm okay, Miss Shêng-shêng.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Right, you still haven't given me an answer.

Hapless Man:
I... I...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Why'd you do something like that?

Hapless Man:
I... It'd been two days since I last had anything to eat. I was starving.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Alright. So you were hungry and you tried to swipe some food. Why did you hurt that lady?

Hapless Man:
When the shop's owner caught me, she saw me holding a dollar bill. She wanted me to pay her with it and wouldn't let me go.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You didn't want to pay up, so you hurt the shop's owner?

Hapless Man:
It was the last dollar bill I had.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
But that doesn't mean you had to...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Oh... You mean that one.

Hapless Man:
Yeah, I was going to the store to buy something to eat, but I met you there, and you signed your name on it. I couldn't spend it.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
......

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Alright, I get it.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Do you... have anywhere to go?

Hapless Man:
N-No... My landlord evicted me last week.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
What'll you do now? Go back home?

Hapless Man:
My parents died early. I don't have anybody left back home.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Do you have any friends here?

Hapless Man:
I only just got to Lungmen two months ago. No time to make any friends.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Well...

Hapless Man:
Miss Shêng-shêng, I don't have any skills... It's not easy for me to make a living. I'm really glad I met you...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
*Sigh*, don't think like that. Things will get better.

Hapless Man:
(Wipes away tears) Sorry for all that trouble I caused.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
What's your plan... for now?

Hapless Man:
I don't know. If I can just somehow earn enough to put food on the table, things ought to work out somehow.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Boss, you got a pen?

Jaye:
*Sigh*. Yeah, in the small drawer. Help yourself.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Let's see. There we go. Can I take a sheet of paper?

Jaye:
Go ahead!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
(Scribbles something down)

Hapless Man:
Miss Shêng-shêng?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Well, this guy's a stage manager I know. Head over there, and have him give you some errands to run. He doesn't pay much, but he can get you meals and a place to sleep.

Hapless Man:
Thanks... a lot.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Boss, two more orders of finballs. One to go, and one for here.

Jaye:
You got it.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Live a decent, upstanding life from here on out, okay? Keep your head down and walk on. Forget everything behind you.

Jaye:
Here's your finballs to go.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Take them with you. And those aren't my treat. You'll have to pay me back once you make it big.

Hapless Man:
Waaahhh... Miss Shêng-shêng... I'm so sorry.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Alright, now get to the studio. You won't find him there if they're done filming for the day.

Hapless Man:
Yeah, thanks. I'll head there now.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
See ya!

Hapless Man:
I'll work hard, I'll be a good person!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Yeah, I know you will!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Phew—

Jaye:
What's with the sigh? My finballs don't taste good enough for you?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Things are tough for me too, you know.

Jaye:
What's the matter? Uncle Loeng stopped by yesterday. He said you haven't picked up his calls for a whole week.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Remember the book we talked about before?

Jaye:
Qisi's 'The Assenting Fist?'

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Yeah, lost all the money I put down on it.

Jaye:
How much?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
All.

Jaye:
No way. Not even a cent left?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
I still have some savings, but it's in a trust for a charity. I can't touch that money.

Jaye:
What will you do, then?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
If luck's on my side, maybe we can catch the guy, and I'll get my money back.

Jaye:
What if...

Wan Shêng-shêng:
I'd have to start over. Don't worry, I got moves. I'll find myself a movie to shoot. Don't worry about me going hungry.

Jaye:
What about your plans?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
What plans?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You know, the less sober you are, the more likely you are to worry about the future. Either thinking what comes tomorrow in your sleep or mumbling what's next while you're drunk. Then, when you come to, you think to yourself, the less you gotta worry about, the better life is.

Jaye:
You'll have another chance. The future'll get better.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You don't need to console me. I'm a tough gal. As long as I get a taste of your finballs tomorrow, things will work out somehow!

Jaye:
What's the thumbs up for?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Hah, I mean, you can't rely on luck to eke out a living.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
I run into these small, happy happenings every once in a while. Those short moments might not change anything, but they help me get through the next couple of days.

Jaye:
So you ran into any of those small, happy things lately?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
You betcha. I just had some of your finballs. They're super good.

Jaye:
Hmph, anything else?

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Hmm... Let's see. Oh, right, a director came calling. The gig pays well too. I might go audition tomorrow.

Jaye:
Alright, I'll treat you to a bowl of finballs.

Jaye:
(Sets down a bowl of finballs on the table)

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Huh? What's this? A new recipe?

Jaye:
I'm trying out a new spicy flavor. Don't know if there's a market for it, so I figured I'd have you taste test.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
I approve!

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Ahhhhh! My tongue's burning. That's hot, even for me!

Jaye:
I got some ice water here.

Wan Shêng-shêng:
Ahhh, no way! *Huff*! This is a good omen! Don't throw cold water on... *Huff*... I'm gonna rake in all the dough. My career's gonna be on fire!

Jaye:
Oh, you...

Two weeks later...

L.G.D. Officer B:
Hey, Jia, morning. Here, a coffee for you.

L.G.D. Officer A:
Thanks, Yao. How's today been? Busy?

L.G.D. Officer B:
Got way too much to work, *sigh*... What are you flipping through the papers for?

L.G.D. Officer A:
Looking for the entertainment news. Speaking of which, how come I haven't seen any news on Miss Shêng-shêng lately?

L.G.D. Officer B:
What, haven't you heard? She got hurt shooting a movie the other day. Got taken to the ER. I wonder how she's doing.

L.G.D. Officer A:
If it was just a flesh wound, she should've gotten out by now, right? I haven't read anything about that, though.

L.G.D. Officer B:
She's a movie star. They keep a low profile when these things happen. She might have made it home already. Stop worrying about her.

L.G.D. Officer A:
It still bothers me, though...

L.G.D. Officer B:
Come on, you're a big guy. Why so sensitive?

L.G.D. Officer A:
Nah, it's just... When I left home this morning, they took down all the billboards and ads with her. Not a single one left.

L.G.D. Officer B:
Huh. Weird.
