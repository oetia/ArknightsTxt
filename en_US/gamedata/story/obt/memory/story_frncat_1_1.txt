Spotted 'Kitty':
Meow—

Mousse:
(Sorry, kitties, I can't play with you today.)

Mousse:
Here's where I live, mummy.

Mrs. Selis:
By yourself, sweetheart?

Mousse:
No, I have a roommate to keep me company.

Mrs. Selis:
Is that right...? I had no idea. I would've brought a gift for her.

Mousse:
Don't worry about it.

Mousse:
She's out on a mission right now and won't be back for a while. She says you can have her bed for these few days, if you want.

Mrs. Selis:
Well... I booked a hotel in a nearby city.

Mousse:
Right... I understand. A hotel would be more comfortable, after all.

Mrs. Selis:
The room may be nice, but it would be too empty without my precious daughter. I'm not sure I'd be able to sleep.

Mousse:
So you'll stay here?

Mrs. Selis:
(Touches Mousse's nose) Yes, sweetheart.

Mousse:
I knew you were coming, so I spent an entire day cleaning up! Everything's sparkling!

Mrs. Selis:
Have you forgotten? You didn't even need to make your own bed at home.

Mousse:
Rhodes Island isn't like home. I have to do a lot on my own. It took some time to get used to, but I've learned a lot.

Mousse:
At first, I didn't know how to put the comforter into its cover.

Mousse:
I kept struggling with it, but I just couldn't get it done.

Mousse:
Guess what happened when I finally managed to get it zipped up?

Mousse:
I almost zipped myself in with it! Hah!

Mrs. Selis:
(Embarrassed smile) That's really something... haha.

Mousse:
Close your eyes, mummy!

Mrs. Selis:
Why?

Mousse:
Just close them for a little bit.

Mrs. Selis:
Hm... alright.

Mousse:
I guarantee you'll be shocked when you see my room.

Mrs. Selis:
Er...

Mrs. Selis:
I certainly am shocked, sweetheart.

Mousse:
Oh no, mummy... it wasn't like that this morning...

'Kitties' run rampant around the messy room.

The curtains have been reduced to barely-recognizable ribbons.

Less fortunate are the vases formerly on the table, with the broken shards on the ground the only sign that they were ever there in the first place.

A 'Kitty' stands on the table, preparing to leap over to the nearby wardrobe.

Mousse looks up to the wardrobe, a vase teeters by the edge, looking like it could fall at any second.

Striped 'Kitty':
(Jumps on top of the wardrobe)

Striped 'Kitty':
Meow!

Mousse:
No! Not the vases!

Striped 'Kitty':
Meow?

Mousse:
Bad kitty!

Mousse:
How could you do this! You're all bad kitties!

Mrs. Selis:
It's ok, sweetheart. They're mischievous creatures.

Mousse:
Sorry, mummy. This isn't what I had meant to show you. I really did clean up.

Mrs. Selis:
I know, sweetheart. Let's find a place to sit down and figure out how to put everything back in its proper place.

Mrs. Selis:
Let's see... is there anywhere we can sit?

Mousse:
Watch out! There's yarn on the floor!

Mrs. Selis:
Watch out for—Aiee!

Mousse:
Are you alright?

Mrs. Selis:
I'm fine... it's just...

Mousse:
I'll call Medical!

Mrs. Selis:
No, I'm not hurt. I just stepped on my dress when I tripped, and I think...

Mousse:
What?

Mrs. Selis:
I think I put a hole in it.

Mousse:
That was a long day... I'm sore all over.

Bibeak:
Didn't you have the day off?

Mousse:
I was preparing for mummy's visit. I've been on edge for days.

Bibeak:
Shouldn't you be happy to have family visiting? Why so nervous?

Mousse:
I've always been worried about disappointing mummy. My siblings are all outstanding, while I'm totally unremarkable.

Mousse:
I've no achievements to speak of, and I caught an illness that can't be spoken of...

Bibeak:
Don't be so down on yourself. Wasn't the Doctor just raving about your incredible progress a few days ago?

Mousse:
It's... It's not enough. You don't know how incredible my siblings are.

Mousse:
Byron is already a lieutenant colonel, and Emily is consulting for several different banks straight out of school.

Mousse:
Violet is an authority on Originium Arts research. And my youngest brother, Carl...

Bibeak:
Violet? <i>That</i> Violet?

Mousse:
Yes, <i>that</i> Violet. She's my older sister.

Bibeak:
Alright... I don't blame you for being nervous, then.

Mousse:
I got compared to them whenever I attended a gathering.

Mousse:
Mummy always defended me, but she's a proud woman, and she must be ashamed to have a daughter like me.

Bibeak:
That's what I hate about high society. The gossip never stops.

Mousse:
That's why I wanted to show her how much I've grown.

Bibeak:
*sigh*...

Bibeak:
......

Bibeak:
Good afternoon, Mrs. Selis. My name is Bibeak, and I'm a friend of Mousse's.

Mrs. Selis:
Thank you for mending my skirt, Miss Bibeak.

Mrs. Selis:
I really appreciate it.

Bibeak:
Er, I'm very glad I could help. Yes. Indeed.

Bibeak & Mrs. Selis:
......

Bibeak:
(Mousse's mother doesn't seem like the chatty type... wherever has Mousse gone? How long will we have to sit here staring at each other?)

Bibeak:
(But what can we even talk about? Argh, I'll just pick a random topic...)

Bibeak:
(Takes a deep breath) Mrs. Selis, I...

Mousse:
Mummy, I made your favorite almond cake.

Bibeak:
(Finally!)

Mousse:
And I made a custard tart for you, Bibeak. It's your favorite, isn't it?

Bibeak:
Thank you, Mousse! I've mended Mrs. Selis's skirt. Her blouse is fine.

Mrs. Selis:
Miss Bibeak did a splendid job. It's like the hole was never there.

Mousse:
G-Great! Let me know whenever you'd care for a pastry. I, I'd love to make you anything.

Bibeak:
No need to go that far. You should sit down too. I'm sure Mrs. Selis can't wait to taste the cake.

Mrs. Selis:
Come, sweetheart, I haven't had your cake in ages.

Mousse:
R-Right.

Mousse:
How is it?

Bibeak:
It's delicious.

Mrs. Selis:
Yes. Just the perfect level of sweetness and moistness. It's so... agh!

Mousse:
What's the matter?

Mrs. Selis:
I think I got something strange in my mouth.

Bibeak:
What are these? Hairs?

Mousse:
Oh no, it's kitty hair! Don't eat any more. I'll get you another piece.

Mousse:
Sorry, they must have gotten in when I forgot to lock the kitchen door.

Mrs. Selis:
It's alright, sweetheart. I don't mind at all.

Mousse:
But mummy...

Mrs. Selis:
It's alright, really.

Mousse:
(But your eyes are turning red...)

Bibeak:
Mousse...

Mrs. Selis:
Ahem. I believe you're a designer, Miss Bibeak? Are you familiar with the latest trends?

Mrs. Selis:
My usual tailor is rather conservative, and I would like to get some dresses that are more in fashion.

Mrs. Selis:
What do young people like you enjoy in dresses?

Bibeak:
Huh? Oh... knit details have been popular the past couple years.

Mrs. Selis:
Knit details... I remember when they were all the rage ten years ago. Or was it fifteen?

Bibeak:
You know what they say about fashion. It all comes back around.

Mousse:
(Twiddles fingers in silence)

Hung:
Here's your food, Mousse. I hope you ladies enjoy it.

Mousse:
(Looks at her cup of tea)

Mrs. Selis:
Sweetheart?

Mousse:
Huh? Oh... wait, I didn't order this many dishes, did I?

Hung:
It's on the house. Always an occasion when an operator gets a family visit.

Hung:
They need me in the kitchen. Eat up.

Mousse:
Thank you, Hung.

Mrs. Selis:
Is the chef your friend too?

Mousse:
Hung knows how to make a lot of Yanese desserts. I pick his brain from time to time.

Mrs. Selis:
It's a nice change of pace. You used to be alone all the time, with only your kitties to keep you company.

Mrs. Selis:
And we're always so busy that we couldn't give you the care and attention you needed...

Mousse:
You and daddy did everything you could to protect me!

Mousse:
I made a lot of friends here, but I've always missed you and daddy. I was so excited when I heard you were coming.

Mousse:
My pay isn't very high, but I've managed to save some money.

Mrs. Selis:
Sweetheart... this is...?

Mousse:
I bought a tea set from Croissant. I hope you don't mind that it's not as nice as the ones you have at home...

Mrs. Selis:
(hands over the chest) Oh... I would never denigrate a gift from you.

Mrs. Selis:
What a beautiful tray! It's so pretty that I'm hesitant to even use it. Maybe I should just put it on display for everyone to see.

Mousse:
As you like. I wanted to show you what I can do, but I keep making mistakes...

Mrs. Selis:
Are you still bothered by that? I told you, it was nothing to be upset about.

Mousse:
But I saw... wait, a kitty in the cafeteria?

Mrs. Selis:
Where's the kitty?

Mousse:
B-Behind you.

Spotted 'Kitty':
Mroaaaw—!

Mousse:
Whoah! Not on the table, kitty!

Mrs. Selis:
Oh no, my cup!

Mousse:
Bad kitty! You're all bad kitties!

Mousse:
You're awful!

Mousse:
Why did you have to make a mess in front of mummy?!

Mousse:
I spent so much time cleaning up and saving money to buy her a present... bad kitties!

Mrs. Selis:
Don't cry, sweetheart...

Mrs. Selis:
(Stands up)

Hung:
What's the matter, Mousse? I heard you crying from the kitchen.

Mint:
Just leave the pieces where they are, Mousse. I'll get a broom.

Jessica:
It's alright, Mousse. I've got plenty of tea sets. Come over and pick one you like.

Haze:
What's all this then? Who's making my little Mousse cry? Give me a name, my hat and I'll show 'em what for.

Mousse:
No... it's all my fault for not being good enough...

Everyone:
Don't say that about yourself!

Mrs. Selis:
Phew—

Mrs. Selis:
(What a relief.)

Mrs. Selis:
Come closer. Let me wipe your hair dry.

Mrs. Selis:
You cut your hair short. I remember you used to like it long.

Mousse:
It was troublesome out in the field, and when baking, so I cut it.

Mrs. Selis:
It's fine. You look very pretty with short hair too.

Mrs. Selis:
Come, sweetheart, it's time for bed.

Mousse:
Mummy...

Mrs. Selis:
What is it?

Mousse:
Are you sure you want to squeeze into my bed?

Mrs. Selis:
You don't want me to?

Mousse:
That's not it, I'm just worried you won't sleep well.

Mousse:
Violet said you hardly slept when you visited her, and you were staying in a five-star hotel.

Mousse:
Could you really sleep in a tiny bed with me?

Mrs. Selis:
Ah... it wasn't because of the bed that I had trouble sleeping.

Mrs. Selis:
Violet had an accident the day before, leaving a huge scar on her forehead. I was so worried that I couldn't sleep.

Mrs. Selis:
Luckily, it wasn't anything serious. She gave her lecture the following day as scheduled, and the crowd wouldn't stop clapping when she finished.

Mousse:
You must have been proud.

Mrs. Selis:
Of course. Violet was always a bright girl. I hardly had to worry about her. Unlike Carl, who kept running around after breaking his elbow last month.

Mousse:
Did he get hurt in a match?

Mrs. Selis:
Yes, and he hid it until the final whistle. He didn't want to be taken out. Your father had words for him when he learned.

Mousse:
Did they win?

Mrs. Selis:
Of course... there isn't a better team in the age group.

Mrs. Selis:
*yawn*...

Mousse:
(Retreats into the sheets)

Mousse:
Mummy...

Mousse:
Are you disappointed in me?

Mousse:
Violet and Carl have done so much to make you proud, but I haven't... I'm not talented. I don't have any special skills.

Mousse:
I didn't get good grades in school. All I did was make you worry after I got sick. You had to take time off work to be with me.

Mousse:
I'm sorry.

Mousse:
I could never make you proud.

Mrs. Selis:
......

Mousse:
(Turns) Mummy?

Mrs. Selis:
Zzz......

Mrs. Selis:
Sweetheart...

Mrs. Selis:
(Reaches for the other side of the bed)

Mrs. Selis:
Sweetheart? Where did she go? The sun isn't up yet... there's nobody in the bathroom either.

Striped 'Kitty':
Meow...

Mrs. Selis:
Kitty...?

Mrs. Selis:
Do you know where my sweetheart is, little one?

Striped 'Kitty':
(Drops head and licks own butt)

Mrs. Selis:
Don't ignore me, kitty.

Striped 'Kitty':
(Keeps licking own butt)

Mrs. Selis:
I know you must feel neglected because Mousse has been busy preparing for my visit. That's why you tried to get her attention.

Mrs. Selis:
Sorry. On her behalf.

Striped 'Kitty':
Meow...

Mrs. Selis:
(Strokes kitty's chin)

Mrs. Selis:
Are you still upset?

Striped 'Kitty':
Meow.

Mrs. Selis:
Will you take me to her?

The kitty rubs itself against Mrs. Selis's feet, then goes over to the door and looks at her, as though telling her to follow.

Mousse:
It's already six? I have to get that bread baked before breakfast...

Mousse:
How could I oversleep?

Mousse:
It must be because I was relaxed around mummy... the dough's ready. Now for the filling.

Mousse:
(Starts whipping cream)

Mousse:
Aw... why does my hand have to itch right now?

Mousse:
I want to scratch it.... no, I'd better not, I won't be able to stop.

???:
Let me help you, sweetheart.

Mousse:
Mummy?

Mousse:
W-What are you doing here? Did I wake you up?

Mrs. Selis:
Are you always up so early making breakfast for the others?

Mousse:
It's the only thing I'm good at. And I like to do it.

Mousse:
I never got much chance to do this at home, but it makes me happy to something I'm good at here.

Mrs. Selis:
Oh, sweetheart...

Mrs. Selis:
How far along are you? I'll help you.

Mousse:
It's alright, I can do it on my own.

Mrs. Selis:
Let's see. The dough's ready. I can help with the filling. You're using cream?

Mousse:
Er, yes. But mummy...

Mrs. Selis:
Shh, sweetheart. This is some mother and daughter time. It's been ages since we baked bread together.

Mousse:
Yes, mummy.

Mousse:
Please make the fillings then.

Mother and daughter go back and forth from the kitchen table to the oven.

There is hardly any talking. A slight gesture, a blink of the eye, is all the communication they need.

Fowlbeast eggs are broken and their contents dropped into bowls. Cream is whipped until filled with air. Syrup is brushed on the dough. Hot air seeps out of the pre-heated oven.

The sounds in the kitchen make a symphony of their own.

Mousse:
We did it, mummy!

Mrs. Selis:
Yes, sweetheart, we did.

Mousse:
Just in time for breakfast.

Mrs. Selis:
Yes, just in time for breakfast.

Mousse:
Maybe we can do a little more...?

Mrs. Selis:
Do what?

Mousse:
(Sprinkles a layer of icing on the bread)

Mousse:
Now it's perfect.

Mrs. Selis:
Agreed.

Mrs. Selis & Mousse:
(Gaze at each other)

Mrs. Selis:
I'm proud of you, sweetheart. Very proud.

Mousse:
Huh...?

Mrs. Selis:
I've never told you that, have I?

Mousse:
Why? I know you're proud of Byron, of Emily, of Violet, and Carl. They're all outstanding.

Mousse:
But I'm just Mousse... I'm not anything.

Mousse:
I've got two tails, I'm bad at maths, I don't know my grammar, I have Oripathy... and my hands get itchy when I have an Oripathy attack.

Mrs. Selis:
I don't care about any of that.

Mousse:
Then what do you care about?

Mrs. Selis:
Mummy only cares that you're happy and doing what you love.

Mrs. Selis:
I fought with your father a lot over whether to send you here.

Mrs. Selis:
I didn't want you going to this place on your own. It wouldn't be as comfortable as home, and we couldn't be there for you if anything happened.

Mrs. Selis:
Before I visited, I was thinking I would bring you back if you didn't like it here, even if I had to pummel your father into it.

Mrs. Selis:
But you're happy here... you're not alone anymore. You have lots of friends who care for you.

Mousse:
But I couldn't welcome you the way Violet could.

Mrs. Selis:
That's rubbish, sweetheart. I've had a delightful time!

Mousse:
But you had tears in your eyes when you found kitty fur in your cake yesterday...

Mrs. Selis:
You've got it all wrong.

Mrs. Selis:
I was happy.

Mousse:
You were?

Mrs. Selis:
I haven't enjoyed a pastry of yours in so long. Not since you got sick.

Mrs. Selis:
I had an even more pleasant surprise when I walked into kitchen. You've started baking again, you're... you're still doing what you love here.

Mousse:
I never knew...

Mrs. Selis:
Mousse, my little sweetheart.

Anxious Young Operator:
Mousse, I have a lesson this morning, so I need two to go... oh, good morning, ma'am.

Mrs. Selis:
Er, good morning.

Mousse:
Two to go, Zeiss? Here you are.

Anxious Young Operator:
Thanks... hmm, I've never seen this kind of bread. What is it?

Mousse:
I just made it with the ingredients at hand. There isn't any...

Mrs. Selis:
'Mother's Pride.'

Mousse & Anxious Young Operator?:
Huh?

Mrs. Selis:
The name of the bread is 'Mother's Pride.'
