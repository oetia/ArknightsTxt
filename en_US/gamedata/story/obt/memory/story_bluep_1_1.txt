Glaucus:
How much longer?

Blue Poison:
Be patient.

Glaucus:
It smells really good, though.

Blue Poison:
This is the most enjoyable moment in baking. Watching the batter slowly turn golden and puff up in the oven, until it turns into a soft, fluffy cake...

Blue Poison:
Desserts taste best when you let your imagination run wild, Glau.

Glaucus:
I'd rather have one I can put in my mouth. So what's our flavor of the day?

Blue Poison:
Hm... It's a new formula. Fresh cream mixed with a jam made from various kinds of berries. That gives it a sort of tropical flavor.

Glaucus:
Sure, but its color is as terrifying as ever. Your fashion sense is pretty decent, so how the heck did your sense for food aesthetics end up downright rotten?

Blue Poison:
Hm? But I heard brighter colors can help increase appetites.

Glaucus:
I think most people would disagree with your definition of bright colors.

Blue Poison:
You say that, but you'll still eat it in the end.

Glaucus:
That's 'cause it tastes good.

Glaucus:
Too bad all those self-proclaimed dessert lovers will never know the kind of lusciousness they're missing out on.

Blue Poison:
Not everyone's special like you.

Glaucus:
It's not like you poison your cakes.

Glaucus:
*Sigh*... Normally, this break room would be pretty packed around now, but it feels like there have been way less people ever since we arrived.

Blue Poison:
Don't say that. I'm not being ostracized or anything. I'm actually very happy with my life here.

Blue Poison:
But the best way to get along with something 'toxic' is to stay away from it. I know that, you know that, everyone knows that.

Blue Poison:
On the bright side, how often do you get the whole break room to yourself? Let's try to enjoy this before we head out for our field mission.

Glaucus:
I suppose we won't get much of a chance to enjoy a cake in the Sargon Barrenlands anyway.

Blue Poison:
I hope the mission goes well.

Glaucus:
You say that like you have nothing to do with it. Aren't you the leader of the guerrilla team? True, all we're doing is building a safe house, but we can't let our guard down.

Glaucus:
I heard it's way off the beaten track. Who knows what we'll run into out there. What was it called again...?

Blue Poison:
Kerthun.

Glaucus:
Right, Kerthun Valley. Have you ever been there?

Blue Poison:
No, never.

Glaucus:
Hm, then I guess I'll read over the mission briefing while we eat. First I need to confirm the supply point...

Glaucus:
Oh, sounds like it's done.

Blue Poison:
Alright, now to put the cream on it...

???:
Adnachiel, are you baking another cake behind my back again?!

Glaucus:
Oh.

Blue Poison:
Ambriel?

Ambriel:
Sorry, I smelled cake, so I just...

Glaucus:
You want some too? It's straight out of the oven.

Ambriel:
No, I think I'll...

Ambriel:
......

Ambriel:
(Gulps)

Ambriel:
Did Blue Poison make this...? Why can't it ever be easy?

Blue Poison:
Please, go ahead and try some if you don't mind. We have tea, too.

Ambriel:
Hmm, well, not like I have anything better to do... Guess I can kill some time here.

Ambriel:
As for the cake, let me prepare myself mentally first.

Blue Poison:
Um, if you're worried about poison, you don't need to force yourself...

Ambriel:
Nah, that's not it.

Ambriel:
Isn't, like, the color of that jam kinda creepy?

Ambriel:
Phew—

Glaucus:
Tasty, right?

Ambriel:
I've heard about your baking from Gummy, but this is something else. You could drive half of Laterano's dessert shops out of business.

Ambriel:
The two-bit ones always just load up on sugar, with no idea how to balance flavors. Sweet doesn't have to mean unbearably sweet!

Blue Poison:
...Wow. It's an honor to hear that from a bona fide Lateran.

Ambriel:
You should feel even prouder then, 'cause praise from an expert like me is worth its weight in gold.

Glaucus:
If only more people were willing to give them a shot. I always feel guilty getting the whole cake to myself.

Ambriel:
Well, I, for one, am willing to put my life on the line for an exquisite dessert.

Blue Poison:
...So you were worried, after all?

Blue Poison:
If so, Medical has an antidote specifically for my toxins. It's kind of embarrassing to say this myself, but if you need it—

Ambriel:
Shoot, sorry, I didn't mean it like that!

Glaucus:
Watch out, your bag!

Glaucus:
These are...

Ambriel:
......

Ambriel:
Ahaha, I had the antidote prepared in advance. I mean, we *are* going on a field op together in a couple days.

Glaucus:
Oh, right, you're part of our team this mission.

Ambriel:
Yeah, so we're gonna be fighting side by side, right? It's just a precaution, a precaution. Y'know what they say, better safe than...

Ambriel:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

Blue Poison:
No, please don't apologize. I actually prepared enough antidote for everyone too. It's my responsibility for being toxic.

Blue Poison:
If everyone else is uncomfortable with me being there, then I should be the one apologizing.

Ambriel:
Blue Poison...

Ambriel:
Then, like, can I have another slice?

Blue Poison:
Ambriel?

Blue Poison:
Please, I know you're trying to be kind, but you don't have to—

Ambriel:
C'mon, what of self-respecting Lateran would force themselves to eat cake? Just gimme another slice.

Glaucus:
Huh. I think I'm starting to see you in a new light. Here you go.

Ambriel:
Thanks.

Ambriel:
But man, I wish I could just have complete trust in my friends like you, Glaucus.

Glaucus:
Oh, that's because her toxins don't work on me.

Ambriel:
*Cough* *cough*!

Glaucus:
Slow down! Here, have some antidote.

Ambriel:
*Cough*! No, no that, tea, tea—

Glaucus:
You sure? This is fruit juice-flavored. I had Dr. Warfarin come up with the formula.

Ambriel:
Who cares, just give it!

Blue Poison:
Pfff... Hahahaha!

Blue Poison:
Thanks, Ambriel.

Blue Poison:
If only... all my days here at Rhodes Island could be like this.

Ambriel:
Pwah—That hits the spot! Sorry, what was that?

Blue Poison:
Oh, nothing.

Blue Poison:
Anyway, since you're here, let's read over the mission briefing while we're eating.

Ambriel:
Huh? We're really gonna start working, just like that? This is the break room! I came here to slack off!

Ambriel:
But fine, fine, I'll work overtime, just for you, Bloop. Like, I have to thank you for the cake.

The Kerthun Valley is situated in a vast rainforest within Sargon's borders. Since time immemorial, it has never been under the direct control of the Sargonian lords ameer.

This was the most important factor in Rhodes Island's decision to build a safe house there.

There are many reasons for its unique geopolitical position. Data show that the area is abundant with natural resources, and many lords ameer have tried to expand their influence into the region.

Yet their efforts were all in vain.

Glaucus:
The specific reasons require further investigation, but according to a local guide, it very likely has to do with the indigenous people.

Glaucus:
Those natives are also the biggest variable in our mission. The guide said they aren't too hard to get along with, but also warned that they possess a terrifying ability.

Glaucus:
We only have vague descriptions of the phenomenon in question, but based on our analysis, their ability might be an application of some kind of toxic chemical compound...

Ambriel:
Whoa, sounds like a huge pain.

Glaucus:
Relax. The mission's difficulty rating isn't all that high. We aren't there to pick a fight.

Blue Poison:
......

Glaucus:
Blue Poison?

Blue Poison:
Oh, don't mind me. Go on.

Glaucus:
Okay, where was I...

Glaucus:
We're going to build a safe house there. It will also be used as both a Catastrophe monitoring station and a temporary medical post. Our job will be over once the local employees have moved in.

Ambriel:
Yep, about as standard as it gets.

Glaucus:
In other words, if all goes well, we'll be back on the landship baking cakes in a couple of months.

Ambriel:
What do you mean, 'if all goes well'? You trying to jinx us?!

Glaucus:
...Have you considered that you're a little oversensitive?

Ambriel:
Still, there's one thing that's kinda bothering me. Those natives... Like, what race are they?

Glaucus:
We have no data on it. Supposedly, they don't have any particular distinctive features, but...

Blue Poison:
They're Anura.

Blue Poison:
Just like me.

Glaucus:
...How do you know?

Blue Poison:
Because they're from my tribe.

Blue Poison:
Kerthun is my homeland.

Glaucus:
What? Why are you only telling us this now? This is news to me!

Blue Poison:
I had no reason to bring it up, Glau. I wasn't lying when I said I'd never been there. I grew up in Iberia.

Blue Poison:
Everything I know about the place, I learned from my grandmother.

Ambriel:
So what's it like?

Blue Poison:
Hm, I'm not too sure myself. My grandma told me a lot of stories, but honestly she made it all sound a bit too wonderful, like a fairy tale.

Blue Poison:
My people moved from Sargon to Iberia over a hundred years ago. 'Moved,' she told me. Even that is something of a euphemism for the bitter truth.

Blue Poison:
We were sold to Iberia as test subjects. Our lives are inseparable from poison from the moment we're born. It's an unfortunate talent, but some people always see things differently.

Blue Poison:
Conspiracies and poison. Two sides of the same coin, don't you think?

Ambriel:
Listen, we don't have to talk about this if you don't want to.

Blue Poison:
I'm fine. But thanks for worrying about me.

Blue Poison:
Truth is, I've only heard about these experiments secondhand. Ever since the disaster, Iberia's been too busy sorting out its own mess to deal with outcasts like us.

Blue Poison:
That cruel past is now nothing more than stories passed down by the older generation, and Kerthun itself is even more of a legend to us.

Blue Poison:
My grandma always started off like, 'A long time ago, when we were still in faraway Kerthun...' You've all heard stories like that too, right?

Glaucus:
'A long time ago, when the Ægir still lived under the sea...'

Ambriel:
'A long time ago, before Laterano was completed...'

Blue Poison:
Hehe, see? All legends start the same.

Ambriel:
Yeah... I don't think I could laugh that off.

Blue Poison:
It was those legends of beautiful Kerthun that kept my family going, from one generation to the next.

Blue Poison:
It was a paradise. A place where no one would fear or scorn us as 'toxic.'

Blue Poison:
My grandma always said our life of ostracization and fear was just a trial for us to endure. Once we were back in Kerthun, everything would be better.

Blue Poison:
This might sound funny, but it was only on her deathbed that she finally told me that she'd never even been there either. And she was the oldest in our family.

Blue Poison:
All those stories she'd loved telling us were made up, based on the stories *she'd* heard growing up, and her own imagination.

Blue Poison:
She didn't even know where it was.

Glaucus:
But now we do.

Blue Poison:
Yeah. And I never imagined I'd find out like this.

Ambriel:
Great! Like, now you get a chance to go back home! Does it really count as home, though...?

Glaucus:
Speaking from experience, you should keep your expectations in check. The actual Kerthun might be nothing like the legends.

Glaucus:
(Uneasy) And you'd still rather stay at Rhodes Island, right?

Glaucus:
Blue Poison?

Blue Poison:
......

Blue Poison:
Yeah, perhaps.

Blue Poison:
But if that's the only place where I can be myself...

Blue Poison:
Doctor?

Ambriel:
Phew, don't scare me like that. I'm not slacking off, okay?!

Glaucus:
Doctor, want to try some cake that Blue Poison baked? It's fresh out of the oven.

Blue Poison:
B-But...

Blue Poison:
U-Um, if you don't mind, I have some antidotes prepared...

Blue Poison:
No, wait, your situation is a little unique. Let me get Dr. Kal'tsit first—

Blue Poison:
Um... Are you really okay?

Glaucus:
You've had two people trying out your cake today. That's a new record.

Blue Poison:
Yep, a new record.

Glaucus:
Don't overthink it, Blue. You've always belonged here.

Blue Poison:
Thanks, Ambriel, Glaucus.

Blue Poison:
And thank you, Doctor.

Blue Poison:
If... If I can really...

Blue Poison:
No, never mind. Please forget I said anything.

Blue Poison:
See you at the meeting, Doctor.

Blue Poison:
Yes, we're quite familiar with the details.

Blue Poison:
But I would like to repeat my request to be removed as team captain. I'm not the right person to lead a team in an operation.

Blue Poison:
Everybody knows that my toxins could harm others...

Blue Poison:
Really...?

Glaucus:
That's right. We're counting on you, Captain.

Ambriel:
'Sides, we've got, like, tons of antidotes.

Glaucus:
Apple-flavored, too.

Blue Poison:
Haha... I guess.

Blue Poison:
I will give it my all.

Glaucus:
Okay, off we go now.

Blue Poison:
Yep, see you in a little.

Blue Poison:
Let me help you clean up your files, Doctor.

Blue Poison:
(Did our hands... just touch?!)

Blue Poison:
I'm so sorry I touched you!

Blue Poison:
Please come with me. We need to head to Medical to get it cleaned up! If not... If not...

Blue Poison:
But...!

Blue Poison:
But I... I'm 'toxic.' Anything that touches me is in danger.

Blue Poison:
Am I really allowed to be?

Blue Poison:
—Phew.

Blue Poison:
In that case, I'd like to remove an application from that stack of documents.

Blue Poison:
I actually submitted a transfer request not too long ago. I was hoping to be stationed at the Kerthun safe house after the mission.

Blue Poison:
When I was a kid, my grandmother told me that Kerthun was the only place where we could ever live without being branded 'toxic.' And I believed her.

Blue Poison:
But I'm the only one who can decide who I am, aren't I?

Blue Poison:
I'm a member of Rhodes Island, and I like my life here.

Blue Poison:
So please, let me withdraw that application before anyone reads it.

Blue Poison:
Oh, and one other thing, Doctor...

Blue Poison:
I have an idea for a new dessert. Would you like to try it later, if you have time?
