Skadi:
Who's Rober?

Friendly Villager:
Ah, that's me.

Skadi:
This is your food for today.

Friendly Villager:
Ah, alright.

Skadi:
Also, Joni wanted me to bring this present to you.

Friendly Villager:
Oh, these are my favorite flowers! Why didn't he come himself?

Skadi:
He said he was working.

Friendly Villager:
Coward.

Skadi:
If you're fine, I'm going.

Friendly Villager:
Hey, hey, visitor, wait.

Skadi:
He already paid.

Friendly Villager:
No, you're Skadi, the bounty hunter who came into the village recently, right?

Skadi:
Mm.

Friendly Villager:
I hear you've been doing a lot for us. I've been wanting to meet you.

Skadi:
It wasn't anything major.

Friendly Villager:
Sit down, Skadi. Eat something, it's on me.

Skadi:
...Is there wine?

Friendly Villager:
Will ale be okay?

Skadi:
Mm.

Friendly Villager:
Here.

Friendly Villager:
Your accent's very strange, Skadi. You're not an Iberian, are you?

Skadi:
Mm.

Friendly Villager:
How rare. We often have refugees pass through this place, but I've never seen someone who wasn't an Iberian before.

Friendly Villager:
Visitor, where did you come from?

Skadi:
I came from the sea.

Friendly Villager:
The sea? You’re an Ægir?

Friendly Villager:
We have Ægir in our village too, but I don't think they're too different from us. Not like you. I felt the difference between us the moment I saw you.

Friendly Villager:
I've heard them tell of how they all left Ægir and came ashore when my grandfather was my age.

Friendly Villager:
Oh, yes. My neighbor is an Ægir too. I'll get her to have a chat with you.

Skadi:
No need.

She once held such hopes, but when she saw the Ægir of dry land, she knew she and they were nothing alike.

Only the oldest of them still dimly remembered what Ægir even looked like.

She had nothing she could share with them, nor they with her.

Friendly Villager:
Alright.

Friendly Villager:
Ah, Skadi, did you know? The village has been talking about you every day.

Skadi:
Hm?

Friendly Villager:
When you arrived in the village, you gave everyone an awful scare. We all thought you were just fleeing here after other bounty hunters injured you.

Friendly Villager:
It frightened us. A wounded bounty hunter is like a temperamental beast.

Most creatures of dry land are frail, unable to harm her.

What harmed her were those who profess themselves the Church of the Deep.

They were fixated on her for reasons unknown. Moreover, they were clearly unlike ordinary Iberians.

Friendly Villager:
But now, they're all saying they've never met a bounty hunter as kind as you.

Skadi:
Are bounty hunters usually bad news?

Friendly Villager:
We've had bounty hunters hiding in our village before. They were especially ferocious, and kept clashing with the villagers.

Friendly Villager:
So at first, we'd all discussed whether or not to drive you away.

Skadi:
I'll leave.

Friendly Villager:
Don't! You've given us so much help these past few days. We're all so fond of you now.

Friendly Villager:
You can stay here as long as you like.

Friendly Villager:
Or is there someplace you need to go?

Skadi:
I don't know.

Friendly Villager:
Really? Then are you going back home?

Skadi:
I...

Friendly Villager:
Ah, I'm sorry. I know, I know, there're so many people who run far away because their homes have been destroyed. I'm so stupid...

Skadi:
No.

Friendly Villager:
Eh?

Skadi:
No, maybe you're right.

Friendly Villager:
Oh! The bell's ringing?

Skadi:
What's happening?

Friendly Villager:
The village's bell only sounds in times of emergency...

Panicky Villager:
Rober, Rober!

Friendly Villager:
Joni, weren't you working?

Panicky Villager:
Hide yourself!

Friendly Villager:
What's going on?!

Panicky Villager:
There's a pack of monsters near the village! They've hurt some of us already! We need to hold them off!

Panicky Villager:
Get down to the cellar and hide, now!

Friendly Villager:
O-Okay!

Skadi:
......

Panicky Villager:
Skadi, you... you're not one of us. You'd better run.

Friendly Villager:
If you're scared, come with me. Our house's cellar can hide plenty of people.

Skadi:
...No.

Since coming ashore, Skadi has had a constant feeling.

This feeling gradually grows ever stronger in the wake of these occurrences. Violent, relentless, restless.

But she has never dared convince herself.

She dares not convince herself— that she is why the sea monsters come.

Terrified Villager:
Eek! Noooo!!!

Sea Monster:
—!

Panicky Villager:
Quick, hide behind me!

Terrified Villager:
Wh—What are these monsters?!

Panicky Villager:
I've heard tales! They're monsters from the sea!

Panicky Villager:
Normally, they'd never crawl out to a dry inland place like this. Why would they show here...?

Panicky Villager:
And so many!

Sea Monster:
—!

Terrified Villager:
What now?! It doesn't look hurt at all!

Panicky Villager:
...They don't move that fast. Run, meet with the others!

Terrified Villager:
Okay...

Terrified Villager:
Eek! They're here too!

Terrified Villager:
No! Stay back!

Panicky Villager:
Damn things! I'll take you with me!

Panicky Villager:
Guh...

Terrified Villager:
No! Nooo!

Sea Monster:
—!

Sea Monster:
......

Panicky Villager:
With just a single sword... Skadi, you're so strong!

Skadi:
......

Panicky Villager:
Are you going to stay and help us?

Skadi:
Mm.

Panicky Villager:
You really are a good one!

Skadi:
I'm not.

Skadi:
...Come with me.

When Skadi opened her eyes on the beach, she found not a single soul by her side.

Ægir. Abyssal Hunters. All lives on the line, flesh to flesh, blood to blood.

None of it seemed to exist.

Only the sounds of the waves and the wind stirred in her ears.

Sea Monster:
—!

Sea Monster:
......

Countless times she tried to return to the ocean.

But every time, countless sea monsters would surround her, forcing her to turn back midway.

Skadi:
Out of the way.

At some point, as she was forced yet again to swim back, she even felt a sort of misperception arise within her—

That the abyssal infinitude of monsters were not pursuing her, but rather sending her off.

Skadi:
(Ægirian) Why—must you come near me?

Once she became aware of the possibility she may never return to the sea, she had no choice but to turn around on the shore and set foot onto this land she'd never been concerned with before.

This land.

Friendly Villager:
Skadi's incredible...

Panicky Villager:
Rober, what are you doing out here?!

Friendly Villager:
I was worried for Skadi... and besides, she's come to help us. Shouldn't we at least help defend our own homes?

Panicky Villager:
You're right...

Brave Villager:
Absolutely right!

Skadi:
I don't need help.

In her eyes, the people of dry land are by and large akin to the ones before her now.

Frail, melancholic, leading lives devoid of efficiency or any positive qualities to speak of.

Friendly Villager:
Don't be like that, Skadi. We can't let you bear everything for us.

Panicky Villager:
I'll go and help her! I don't know if I can hurt any of these monsters, but I can at least distract some of them!

Friendly Villager:
I'll help too!

Brave Villager:
Everyone, with Skadi!

Skadi:
(Ægirian) I said—don't come near me!

But she is forced to admit. There are some points of intersection between them, where they can understand one another. In the emotional.

She can understand what circumstances lead them to feel what sentiments.

And it is exactly this that vexes her more and more. It is for this that she feels guilt.

But she cannot divulge these feelings to the villagers. She can only hasten the swing of the greatsword in her hand.

Panicky Villager:
What's she saying?

Brave Villager:
Look, she's moving faster! I'm sure she's encouraging us!

Panicky Villager:
Alright, watch this!

Sea Monster:
—!

Panicky Villager:
Get out of my sight, monsters!

Sea Monster:
—!

Panicky Villager:
Rgh...

Brave Villager:
Don't be scared! See how you like THIS, monster!

Panicky Villager:
Appreciated!

Brave Villager:
We're all friends. It's only right.

Sea Monster:
—!

Brave Villager:
They're scared! Keep going, everyone, let's drive these monsters out!

Villagers:
Yeah!

Friendly Villager:
Wonderful! I think the rest have run. I can't see any trace of them around the village anymore.

Brave Villager:
Heh heh. We're pretty incredible ourselves, aren't we?

Friendly Villager:
What are you so proud of? If it wasn't for Skadi, we'd probably all be done for.

Panicky Villager:
Hahah, just leave him be. We all made it through, so let him have this one.

Friendly Villager:
Alright, alright.

Skadi:
......

She too once had comrades-in-arms, ones who fought alongside her, shared in the revelry of battle with her.

A vast number of them perished in that battle.

In the past, she was no stranger to sacrifice.

But as she watches the villagers share in the joy from the bottoms of their hearts, a thought suddenly comes to her—

She may be the very last Abyssal Hunter.

Skadi:
......

Friendly Villager:
What's wrong, Skadi? You don't look happy.

Skadi:
...It's nothing.

Brave Villager:
If you ask me, I bet she's hungry.

Panicky Villager:
Now that you mention it, I'm a little hungry too, haha!

Friendly Villager:
Enough of that. Still, Skadi, you saved the day today. I'll personally prepare a feast in honor of you tonight.

Friendly Villager:
And I'm sure nobody in the village is opposed to you becoming one of us, after you helped us in such a tremendous way.

Brave Villager:
I was never opposed from the start!

Panicky Villager:
No objections from me either! Hear hear, Skadi, stay in our village as long as you like, I say!

Skadi:
......

Friendly Villager:
It's true, Skadi. With your might, we'd also feel so much safer if you stayed.

Friendly Villager:
Don't you have nowhere to go?

Friendly Villager:
You can live with us.

Skadi:
No. I've decided now.

Skadi:
If I can't return to the sea, then I'll go where there's no water.

Chatty Bounty Hunter:
Hey, you hear about that Skadi business?

Curious Bounty Hunter:
Skadi? Don't think I have.

Chatty Bounty Hunter:
Something tells me your grapevine sucks.

Curious Bounty Hunter:
Fine, fine, I'm out of the loop, just tell me already.

Chatty Bounty Hunter:
Skadi's this Ægir who suddenly showed up out of nowhere a little while ago.

Curious Bounty Hunter:
Ægir? Where's that from?

Chatty Bounty Hunter:
You... whatever. Makes sense a Kazimierzian would never hear about Ægir. I don't know too much myself, but I know it's a country and that's enough.

Curious Bounty Hunter:
Ohh... and? What's up with this Skadi?

Chatty Bounty Hunter:
She's got this giant greatsword, and you wouldn't miss her clothes from a mile away, but she's refused to ever work with anyone else. At first, everyone thought she'd kick it in the middle of nowhere.

Chatty Bounty Hunter:
But she's not only been thriving, she's been stealing a lot of other people's work.

Curious Bounty Hunter:
Huh?

Chatty Bounty Hunter:
Last month, 'Flamelung' announced he was going to sort her out. Guess what happened?

Curious Bounty Hunter:
He drove her off?

Chatty Bounty Hunter:
No, she took down the entire squad he sent at her!

Curious Bounty Hunter:
That's... Where the hell did she come from?

Chatty Bounty Hunter:
Don't know. Got sources who say she showed up alongside a bunch of bounty hunters coming back from Iberia.

Chatty Bounty Hunter:
Either way, apparently it's got 'Flamelung' pretty goddamn fuming now. Me, I'm looking forward to the show.

Taciturn Passerby:
Excuse me.

Chatty Bounty Hunter:
Huh? Who're you?

Taciturn Passerby:
Who I am does not matter, I'm simply curious. You just mentioned an Ægir. Where is she right now?
