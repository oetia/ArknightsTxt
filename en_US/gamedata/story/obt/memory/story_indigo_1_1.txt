*snip* *snip*...

*snip* *snip* *snip*...

Goldenglow:
I'm really jealous of you, Indigo. You've got such long, wonderful hair. You look amazing no matter how we style it.

Indigo:
You think so? Why, I've never really thought of it that way.

Goldenglow:
What do you mean?

Indigo:
When I still lived by the seaside, my hair often got pretty damp because of how humid the air there is.

Goldenglow:
Tilt your head a little to the left, please—Okay, just like that. Don't move.

*snip* *snip*...

Indigo:
...That stopped happening after I came to Rhodes Island.

Indigo:
But the air has gotten a lot drier the last couple days, and it's gotten more difficult to take care of my hair.

Goldenglow:
We've probably driven into a more arid area.

*snip* *snip*...

Indigo:
Is that so...?

Indigo:
Right... I suppose that's probably why.

Indigo:
Because of how dry the air is, I've started having static electricity build up in my hair.

*snip*

Goldenglow:
Even hair as pretty as yours? Is it serious?

Indigo:
Let me think... When I comb my hair in the morning, it's like...

Goldenglow:
Like...?

Indigo:
How do I describe this...?

Indigo:
Like D32 Steel.

Indigo:
And sometimes, the shorter strands stand up like RMA70-12.

Bang!

Indigo:
Did static build up in my hair again?

Goldenglow:
Uh, no, that's not what it was...

Goldenglow:
—But I never knew you had such serious problems with static!

Goldenglow:
Static can really hurt your hair. I've had a lot of trouble with it myself! You can't just leave it alone. You have to take care of it!

Indigo:
Hm... Is it really so scary?

Goldenglow:
It's not a huge problem if it's only for a short while, but if it lasts, your hair will start to get dryer. You'll have to worry about breakage and hair loss, too.

Goldenglow:
Besides, Indigo, you're an Iberian. You just said you used to live by the sea, and your hair was often damp, right?

Indigo:
Oh, yes.

Goldenglow:
Then that's all the more reason not to ignore this. Your hair is used to humid environments, but you suddenly moved to a dry area. It'll upset your hair more than it does others'.

Goldenglow:
I suggest you try these anti-static hair masks. They work really well keeping moisture in, and they're a great fit for your hair since it's on the dry side.

Indigo:
Why, this smells wonderful.

Indigo:
How much?

Goldenglow:
No need to pay me.

Goldenglow:
This is only a trial-size pack, so feel free to take it. If you think it works for you, you'll just need to file an application with the Logistics Department and they'll issue you regular ones for free.

Indigo:
Blue Poison? Glaucus? Why, hello there.

Blue Poison:
Hello, Indigo and Goldenglow.

Goldenglow:
Oh, Blue Poison... and Glaucus. Hello.

Blue Poison:
I figured it might take you a little longer to cut Indigo's hair, so we brought you something to eat.

Indigo:
Thanks, you two. She just finished, actually. Let's have something to eat before the treatment.

Glaucus:
Do you want some, Goldenglow? Blue Poison's really good at making desserts.

Goldenglow:
I... I would love to try some, but this... this cake is colored lake blue... What exactly...?

Blue Poison:
Don't worry, it's nothing difficult to make. It gets its color from only one ingredient.

Goldenglow:
One ingredient...? But what could possibly make your batter... um... this color?

Glaucus:
It's not a very common ingredient, probably. The kind that you don't want to eat too much of in one go.

Goldenglow:
Eh—? Eh?! D-Does that mean—No, that can't be this color...

Goldenglow:
Is this that thing that I keep hearing about...?

Glaucus:
Sorry, sorry. We're just pulling your leg.

Glaucus:
It's nothing as scary as you're thinking. Actually, it's quite normal.

Goldenglow:
But what exactly gave it this color...?

Indigo:
It's food coloring.

Goldenglow:
—Coloring?

Indigo:
Naturally.

Indigo:
Blue Poison is very particular about the color of her desserts. If normal ingredients can't bring her ideas to life, she has no choice but to rely on food coloring.

Goldenglow:
Phew...

Goldenglow:
And here I was thinking if anything could've given it this color... it'd have to be something poisonous.

Goldenglow:
So, um, is it okay I give this cake a try?

Blue Poison:
Of course.

Goldenglow:
Okay... Here I go.

Goldenglow:
......

Goldenglow:
(Munches)

Goldenglow:
(Eyes glitter in a golden glow)

Goldenglow:
Can I have another?

Blue Poison:
Of course. Help yourself.

Blue Poison:
We have some drinks here, too. Right, try some of this rose-colored one. It goes really well with desserts—

Goldenglow:
Huh? What just happened?!

Blue Poison:
It looks like the power went out.

Glaucus:
I'll head outside and check out the circuits. You guys stay here. I'll be right back.

Goldenglow:
Why did the power go out all of a sudden? I-Is it because I didn't keep my static under control?

Indigo:
I don't think you're the reason.

Goldenglow:
I'm not?

Indigo:
When you cut my hair just now, I didn't get shocked even once. That's why I don't think it was you.

Goldenglow:
Um... Actually, I did get shocked once...

Indigo:
Really?

Blue Poison:
Speaking of static electricity, maybe some appliance in here short-circuited?

Indigo:
Why, that might just be—Oh, right!

Goldenglow:
Is the power back?

Blue Poison:
That's Indigo's Originium Arts.

Goldenglow:
You're right. It doesn't look much like the lights we usually have here. The colors are so much warmer.

Goldenglow:
But wouldn't this take a toll on your body?

Indigo:
It's no problem.

Blue Poison:
If you start feeling tired from casting your Arts, be sure to rehydrate and have something sweet.

Indigo:
You don't have to worry. I used to be a lighthouse keeper. Even without any equipment, this much is nothing to write home about.

Indigo:
I'll light up our surroundings. You should go back to your rooms and see if your appliances are still working.

Goldenglow:
Thanks, Indigo!

Goldenglow:
Let's see. Hairdryer, hair clippers, heater...

Blue Poison:
There's a water kettle and a TV here...

Indigo:
Blue Poison, can I have something to drink? I'm a little thirsty.

Blue Poison:
Help yourself. Remember, it's the rose one.

Indigo:
Why, thank you.

Goldenglow:
The perm machine... Okay, that's all the appliances I have. They're all working fine.

Blue Poison:
Everything looks okay over here, too. It might be an external issue. We'll figure out what to do after Glau gets back.

Blue Poison:
Indigo, you can stop casting now. Come take a break.

Indigo:
......

Blue Poison:
Indigo?

Indigo:
I'm more used to places with at least some light.

Indigo:
Light can give us hope. That's what my teacher always told me.

Indigo:
Why, when I used to be a lighthouse keeper, my teacher and I would try to keep the lights up for as long as we could.

Blue Poison:
As long as you don't tire yourself out.

Indigo:
It's not a big deal, like I said.

Goldenglow:
This power cut reminds me... We used to have ones at night back when I was still in school in Victoria.

Indigo:
That must have been inconvenient.

Goldenglow:
I'm sure that's what my more zealous classmates thought. That's why they always lit candles to keep studying.

Goldenglow:
Though, to most of my classmates, the power cuts were basically just bonus holidays. Everyone would start chatting or do something else.

Goldenglow:
We would chat by the candlelight and eat the snacks we snuck into the classrooms... Kind of like what we're doing right now, actually.

Indigo:
Then... should I put out the light?

Goldenglow:
Oh, you don't have to. Without the candles, the classroom would have been pitch black. No one likes it that dark.

Indigo:
I suppose you're right.

Glaucus:
I just asked. The power's not very stable right now. That's all. It'll be back very—

Glaucus:
—And there we go.

Indigo:
Phew.

Blue Poison:
We'd better get going now. Keep the cake.

Goldenglow:
Thanks, you two! And remember to come to me if you ever need a haircut!

Blue Poison:
Glau will gladly take you up on the offer.

Blue Poison:
But I'll have to pass. It's not very likely, but it's still somewhat dangerous to make physical contact with me. I have to be extra careful.

Goldenglow:
Is that so...

Blue Poison:
Alright, off we go now.

Goldenglow:
Okay! I'll wash the cups and bring them back to you when we're done.

Glaucus:
Thanks. Just leave them in front of my dorm room.

Goldenglow:
I knew that Blue Poison was a master of poisons, but I never knew she was such a friendly person too.

Indigo:
Yeah, she really is.

Indigo:
But when we first met, she held a crossbow bolt to my neck because she didn't know if I was a friend or a foe.

Goldenglow:
Huh?!

Indigo:
Oh, it's nothing, really. She pulled it back after we cleared our misunderstanding.

Indigo:
She figured out I'm an Iberian from just a few questions, and then explained how somebody else must have mistook me for a bounty hunter.

Goldenglow:
(Sounds kinda weird...)

Indigo:
Okay, I'm finished with the cake.

Goldenglow:
Yep, that was tasty!

Goldenglow:
Let's move on to the next step. Let me put on some hair protector—

Indigo:
......

Goldenglow:
Indigo?

Indigo:
I-I have a question.

Goldenglow:
Okay...?

Indigo:
W-What color was the drink you just drank?

Goldenglow:
Hm, let me think... Blue Poison said it was 'rose.'

Goldenglow:
Oh, yours is light purple.

Goldenglow:
What does it taste like? Can I try?

Indigo:
D-Don't touch it.

Goldenglow:
Huh?

Indigo:
That one's...

Indigo:
(No, I can't. I can't tell her about it.)

Indigo:
(It took so much work just to improve her impression of Blue Poison.)

Indigo:
Why, that's... Glaucus's drink. It was pretty dark earlier, so I couldn't see the color.

Goldenglow:
So you two drank each other's drinks?

Indigo:
Right, that's it...

Goldenglow:
You seem kind of giddy... Did hers have alcohol in it perhaps?

Indigo:
No, but... that's pretty close.

Goldenglow:
You don't seem too well. Do you want to rest a little first?

Indigo:
Right, okay. I'll go get some rest...

Goldenglow:
Alright. I'll take care of the tray and the cups—

Indigo:
N-No, don't! Don't touch Glaucus's drink.

Goldenglow:
Huh? Why not?

Indigo:
(Well...)

Indigo:
I-I'll wash the cups. T-That's my own cup... so I-I'll wash it myself.

Goldenglow:
Are you sure you're feeling up to it?

Goldenglow:
You don't have to force yourself. I can do the dishes; you just go get some rest.

Indigo:
W-Wait!

Goldenglow:
Huh? Indigo?

*chugs the drink*

Goldenglow:
Did you just drink the rest...?

Indigo:
I... Sorry, but I... I need to pay a visit to Medical.

Goldenglow:
Medical?

Indigo:
Why, yes. I... I'm going... to Medical.

Indigo:
P-Please don't touch the cup. Wait... Wait till I'm back...

Goldenglow:
You really don't look very well at all to me. How about I come with you?

Indigo:
N-No need. I'm fine, really... P-Please just wait... wait here... After I get back, we... we need to work... on... um... my hair...

Indigo stands up and stumbles out of the room like she is absolutely inebriated.

Goldenglow:
What is it with her...?

Goldenglow:
Maybe she's having an allergic reaction to something in Glaucus's drink?

Goldenglow:
I need to go check on her—

Blue Poison:
Goldenglow? Where's Indigo?

Goldenglow:
Blue Poison?

Goldenglow:
She said she was going to pay Medical a visit and stumbled outside. I'm really worried about her. Is she okay?

Blue Poison:
You said she left on her own, unsteadily? She didn't pass out, did she?

Goldenglow:
No, she didn't... but I'm worried she might on her way there. She looked pretty smashed.

Glaucus:
(Relaxed sigh)

Glaucus:
Where's the rest of her drink? I'll take care of it.

Goldenglow:
You mean the light purple one?

Glaucus:
Yeah, that one.

Goldenglow:
She drank half of it, then she looked like she was a little sick. I was going to pour it out and wash the cup, but she wouldn't let me. In the end, she even drank the rest of it.

Blue Poison and Glaucus:
?!

Blue Poison:
She drank the entire cup, and she could still trudge herself out of the room?

Goldenglow:
More or less...

Blue Poison:
......

Blue Poison:
What should I say... She's really growing fast.

Blue Poison:
(Chuckles)

Blue Poison:
The stuff in that drink isn't very strong. As long as she can make it out the door and to the Medical Department, there is nothing to worry about.

Blue Poison:
But just to be safe, Glaucus, you should go to Medical and check on her—

???:
Excuse me, are Operators Blue Poison and Glaucus here?

Medic Operator:
Are you feeling better?

Indigo:
Why, yes, much better.

Medic Operator:
Blue Poison's antidote works fast, huh.

Medic Operator:
Of course, you've gotten yourself poisoned way too many times now. It's no wonder you're building up a resistance against it.

Indigo:
Haha...

Medic Operator:
Come to think of it, Blue Poison's usually pretty good at keeping her toxins under control, but you ingested a lot more this time than usual. What happened?

Indigo:
That's because I made a mistake and drank Glaucus's drink.

Medic Operator:
Glaucus? From what I remember, she's practically immune to just about any kind of toxin.

Indigo:
Right, that's why when Blue Poison makes drinks for Glaucus, she often adds ingredients that would normally be toxic. To Glaucus, they're nothing more than quirky seasonings to spice things up.

Medic Operator:
Like how coffee's poisonous to some animals?

Indigo:
Yeah, that one.

Indigo:
Why, if someone else had drank it, their symptoms would have been much worse.

Medic Operator:
Most people wouldn't.

Medic Operator:
Do you want some more water?

Indigo:
No thanks.

Indigo:
Hm... I vaguely remember running into somebody on my way to the Medical Department, and they brought me here...

Medic Operator:
It was Operator Irene. She brought you in and left just as quickly.

Indigo:
Irene. Irene...

Indigo:
The Inquisitor?!

Medic Operator:
Right, it's the young—

Indigo:
Excuse me for a moment!

Medic Operator:
Hey, you just got up! You should take it easy—Where are you even going?!

Indigo:
P-Phew... I'm still feeling a little dizzy...

Indigo:
No, I have to hurry—

Indigo:
Irene?

Irene:
You're quick to recover.

Indigo:
It's true that I am more resistant to toxins—No, that's not what I wanted to talk about!

Indigo:
Irene, please don't blame Blue Poison and Glaucus. They didn't do it on purpose!

Irene:
(Sighs)

Indigo:
I was the one who drank Glaucus's drink by mistake. I'm the one to blame!

Irene:
(Sighs even more heavily)

Irene:
Operator Indigo... I suggest you go back to Medical to rest a little longer.

Indigo:
Huh...? Why?

Irene:
It seems your head isn't quite clear yet. You're obviously conflating me with whatever distorted image you have of the Inquisitors.

Indigo:
Huh...?

Irene:
They already told me how you drank something meant for Operator Glaucus.

Irene:
While it might perk her up because of her resistance to toxins, most people would be poisoned just by coming into contact with it.

Irene:
Besides, there was that hair stylist who was sparking nonstop the whole time as witness. I have no doubt that this was nothing but an unfortunate little accident.

Indigo:
So... they're safe, right?

Irene:
What do I do with you...?

Irene:
I'm an operator of Rhodes Island now. Even if you <i>were</i> intentionally poisoned, I don't have the authority to judge them on my own.

Irene:
As both a Rhodes Island operator and an Iberian, I'm sure you know this, don't you?

Indigo:
Ugh...

Indigo:
S-Sorry.

Irene:
It's okay. As long as you understand.

Irene:
Now, you were just poisoned. You really should go back and get some rest.

Indigo:
Okay...

Indigo:
Huh?

Irene:
Anything else?

Indigo:
There are some lake blue cake crumbs on your lips.

Irene:
!

Irene:
This... It was my duty to investigate the truth. I had to make sure...

Indigo:
Really?

Irene:
Ugh.

Irene:
(Quietly) At least... that's what I was thinking for the first slice.

Irene:
(Quietly) Of course, the stylist was on the verge of tears when she recommended it to me. That played a role, too.

Indigo:
I see.

Indigo:
You may not like it when I put it like this, but you are... rather different from most other Inquisitors I've met.

Irene:
Really?

Indigo:
Most Iberian Inquisitors I'm familiar with try their best to avoid contact with the Ægir, even if they know they're innocent.

Irene:
I admit I may be a bit of a special case in this regard.

Irene:
However, if I ever uncover any evil lurking here, I will personally see it eradicated.

Irene:
What about you, Operator Indigo?

Indigo:
Me?

Irene:
I want to hear what you think about all this. As a Rhodes Island operator or as an Iberian. Doesn't matter.

Indigo:
Why, not much at all, really. All I know is that both of them are my friends, and I don't want to see them wrongfully accused because of me.

Irene:
......

Irene:
I like your answer.

Irene:
Goodbye, Operator Indigo. I enjoyed our conversation.

Indigo:
Goodbye, Irene—

Indigo:
Hold on, that fragrance...

Indigo:
Did Goldenglow recommend you the same hair mask?
