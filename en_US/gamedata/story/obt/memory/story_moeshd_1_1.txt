Sora:
Exusiai, any word from Croissant?

Exusiai:
Yeah, she says yes.

Sora:
She said we could store things here for a while if we run out of room at the office, but it's best to ask first.

Exusiai:
The shopping festival sale completely stuffed the company warehouses. There's hardly any room to even step inside.

Sora:
Yeah, we haven't been so busy in ages.

Exusiai:
Never imagined there was so much storage space under Croissant's room.

Sora:
She told me she rented two floors, one for living and one for storage.

Sora:
She's organized all the stuff into categories. Makes you feel better just looking at it.

Exusiai:
Fruit cans... let's see... crafts, toiletries, clothing, food. Here, I think.

Exusiai:
What are these boxes over here?

Exusiai:
Magnificent Machine Oil?

Croissant:
Exusiai! Came as soon as I heard. Didja find a place fer yer stuff?

Exusiai:
Yes, but... I saw a bunch of machine oil over there. How did you get the goods so quickly?

Sora:
You still had money left? Didn't you just borrow some from me last month to buy a bunch of cloth?

Croissant:
That's the old kind I had in stock. I was thinkin' about sellin' it to raise the capital to buy the new stuff.

Sora:
Will people really buy obsolete ones like these?

Croissant:
It's from early this year, but it's still good to use. And cheaper'n the new kind. I'm sure I'll have takers.

Exusiai:
Just from early this year? Wow, they sure release updates fast.

Croissant:
Two new versions in a year. Yep, they must put some juice into R&D.

Sora:
Croissant...

Croissant:
What's on yer mind, Sora?

Sora:
It'd be hard for me to guarantee quality if a record company wanted me to release two albums in a year, but I don't know the situation here...

Croissant:
S'fine, I've used this machine oil fer ages. The quality's good.

Low Male Voice:
Magnificent, the choice of a master. I am Tsui-Tsui, and I endorse this message.

Croissant:
Hey, ain't that the engineer who's all the rage on the video websites right now? Didn't think he'd do a collab with Magnificent. Guess he really likes the new product.

Exusiai:
Word of mouth is the important thing. The opinion of one master doesn't mean much.

Croissant:
People're linin' up to buy it. More popular'n I ever thought it could be.

Croissant:
Gotta stock up on a sure-seller like that!

Exusiai:
It's a sure-seller, sure. What about your stock, though?

Croissant:
Sigh... all the vendors what came to me were offerin' cents on the dollar, like they were colludin' or somethin'. Musta found out I need cash on short notice.

Exusiai:
So what are you thinking? Are you selling?

Croissant:
I'll hafta, if'n I don't get any news within the week.

Exusiai:
It's what it is. You win some, and you lose some.

Croissant:
Oh, bless your heart. Makin' me feel better, Exusiai?

Exusiai:
Ahem. Watch the road, not me.

Car Radio:
Fragrances on sale now! Great deals on everything! All the fragrance you could want at shocking discounts! Call Dainty Fragrances at xxxxxxxx if interested.

Croissant:
Hah, looks like I ain't the only one tryin' to clear out stock.

Exusiai:
That's a pretty stiff laugh, Croissant.

Car Radio:
Live a healthier life with oat milk and coffee. One plus one can equal more than two.

Exusiai:
Man, ads these days are just getting worse and worse.

Croissant:
What'cha mean? I thought it made a lot of sense.

Exusiai:
Living a better life with oat milk and coffee?

Croissant:
Naw, the second bit.

Exusiai:
One plus one can equal more than two?

Croissant:
That's the one.

Gentle Female Voice:
One moment, miss. The representative of Dainty Fragrances is just inside.

Gentle Female Voice:
Mr. Chang, there's a young woman with an appointment here. Are you free right now?

Chang:
Show her in.

Gentle Female Voice:
Come on in, Miss.

Croissant:
Mornin', Mr. Chang. Sorry to show up all unannounced-like.

Chang:
Not a problem, Miss. How should I call you?

Croissant:
Croissant's the name.

Chang:
Very good, Croissant. May I ask why you're here?

Croissant:
Well, I happen to have some stock of Magnificent Machine Oil that I'm tryin' to get off my hands, but it's been mighty tough findin' a buyer.

Chang:
I'm afraid we don't need any machine oil. We're having headaches trying to sell our own stock as it is.

Croissant:
(Wags a finger)

Croissant:
I ain't tryin' to sell ya my goods.

Chang:
Then why are you here?

Croissant:
I'm after a little cooperation.

Chang:
Forgive me for being blunt, but it doesn't look like you have such great marketing channels yourself.

Croissant:
And I ain't offerin' a channel, neither. I'm proposin' a strategy.

Chang:
A strategy?

Croissant:
Darn tootin'. A win-win strategy.

Chang:
And what might that be?

Croissant:
We sell our stock in a package deal.

Chang:
Outdated machine oil and out-of-fashion fragrance. Seems like a combination doomed to fail.

Croissant:
My machine oil comes with a mighty strong smell. Tackin' on a fragrance helps clear that right up.

Croissant:
The real kicker's gonna be the variety of fragrances your company offers.

Croissant:
Oil plus perfume ain't nothin' special, but the variety you got makes it interesting.

Croissant:
We could even do up a 'random fragrance' package to add to the fun.

Chang:
(Nods approvingly)

Croissant:
Now, why don'tcha tell me what yer best-sellin' smell is?

Chang:
Rose.

Croissant:
Let's toss that one out as a free gift.

Chang:
Why would we give away the one that sells the best?

Croissant:
We ain't just givin' it out. You gotta collect a couple other fragrance sets to get the free gift.

Chang:
I see. What if we run out, though? We don't have a lot of rose fragrance in stock.

Croissant:
In that case, we do a lucky draw.

Croissant:
Ya get one chance at the draw for every full set of fragrance you collect.

Chang:
I see. I can come up with something as a consolation prize, and we give out the machine oil and fragrances as the second and third prizes.

Chang:
But I'll need to think about the grand prize...

Croissant:
I'm thinkin' I'n offer the grand prize. It pains my heart, but it's all in the name of business.

Chang:
What is it?

Croissant:
A poster autographed by Emperor himself.

Chang:
Are you serious?!

Croissant:
Sure am... I've this feller fer a mighty long time.

Croissant:
(Oh yeah, I get to put my Employee of the Year Award to good use. It's just takin' up space.)

Chang:
This discussion has been most illuminating, Croissant. Now, about the revenue share...

Chang:
I believe it's only fair that my company gets a bigger cut, considering the major role that our fragrance plays.

Croissant:
I'd say it's too early to talk about that. Let's put our heads together on a detailed sales strategy first.

Chang:
Very well. Here's my card. Feel free to contact us at any time.

Croissant:
That'd be lovely, Mr. Chang. Here's mine.

Chang:
Ohâ€”

Croissant:
What is it?

Chang:
Oh, nothing. I've just never seen a business card so... cute.

Croissant:
Leaves an impression, don't it?

Exusiai:
You're back. How did it go?

Croissant:
Mighty fine. We didn't settle on the revenue split though.

Exusiai:
What's your plan?

Croissant:
Maybe I'll call him up now.

Croissant:
Gotta find his number. Flip through my rolodex here... boutique, appliances store, farm equipment, barber... here ya are, Dainty Fragrances.

Exusiai:
Man, you have so many cards it's dragging on the ground. Do you have a detailed plan, though?

Croissant:
Detailed plan? Too early fer that.

Croissant:
Howdy, Mr. Chang? I dropped by earlier today.

Croissant:
Yep, it's me, Croissant.

Croissant:
I just finished tallyin' up the goods and I'm ready to package 'em. There's just one thing...

Croissant:
A workshop of sorts called me up. They're mighty interested in the oil...

Croissant:
And, er... well, the lady offered an awful temptin' price.

Croissant:
No, I ain't given 'em an answer yet. I'd love to work with a big company like yours, but...

Croissant:
Sure, I understand, but business is business.

Croissant:
Oh no, she's comin'. Gimme a sec.

Exusiai:
(She's one heck of an actress...)

Croissant:
(Covers the receiver lightly)

Croissant:
What?! You really want my entire stock?

Croissant:
I-I couldn't do that. I promised to sell it as a bundle with a real nice pardner. I-It ain't about the money.

Croissant:
Yer desperate? But... I just ain't sure... alright, I'll think about it.

Croissant:
(Releases the receiver)

Croissant:
Sorry to keep you waitin', Mr. Chang. They're awful persistent... they said they just got a big project and need a whole heap of machine oil.

Croissant:
Huh?

Croissant:
You'll increase my share? A-Are ya sure?

Croissant:
Aw, I do appreciate that so very much. Thank you kindly! Would you have time tomorrow mornin' to pick up our chat? That'd be lovely. See ya tomorrow, Mr. Chang.

Exusiai:
You have a deal?

Croissant:
Sure do.

Croissant:
Now I got the capital for new goods, and I'll also get to pay back my debt. That's some mighty fine luck.

Exusiai:
Have you ever thought about a career in acting, Croissant?

Croissant:
Nah, ain't worth it... hey, you aren't serious, are you?

Exusiai:
(Shrugs)

Croissant:
Well... that went awful good.

Croissant:
(Looks at her own reflection in the mirror)

Croissant:
Go make that money, Croissant. If you don't, somebody else will.

Croissant:
That's the last box! Let's see... two left. Not bad! Made my money back even before I sold out.

Exusiai:
I didn't understand why you would stock up like that, but now I guess it makes sense.

Croissant:
Mom n' Dad trained my instincts up like this. They're mighty precise.

Exusiai:
Family of businessmen?

Croissant:
Guess so. I grew up helpin' out around their little shop. So their thinkin' and habits've rubbed off on me.

Exusiai:
Have you found someone for the remaining machine oil?

Croissant:
Customer feedback was good, so I'm plannin' on keepin' it for myself.

Exusiai:
Can I have a bottle?

Croissant:
You can have a whole box, if you want.

Exusiai:
(Checks the labels)

Croissant:
What'cha you lookin' for?

Exusiai:
The ingredients. I need to know if can be used on firearms.

Croissant:
Oh yeah, I was so busy procurin', I never had a chance to look at what they added to the new version.

Croissant:
I still got the old bottles. We could compare 'em.

Croissant:
Here we go! Let's see... what did they add?

Exusiai:
75% mineral oil.

Croissant:
Same. Additives?

Exusiai:
Viscosity improver, antioxidant, anti-corrosive...

Croissant:
Don't see anythin' different. What was the secret ingredient they were talkin' up in the ad?

Exusiai:
Wait, there's something at the end... rose oxide?

Croissant:
Whassat? Lemme look it up... rose oxide is a fragrance chemical found in roses and rose oil.

Exusiai:
So all the new version added was a fragrance?

Croissant:
I feel... like I got played.

Exusiai:
Well, you know what they say. Great minds think alike.

Exusiai:
(Pats Croissant on the shoulder)

Exusiai:
Let's go. We have orders to deliver tonight.

Croissant:
Sigh...

Exusiai:
Aren't you going, Croissant?

Croissant:
......

One month later...

Exusiai:
Why is there always a line here? It wraps all the way around the corner.

Sora:
Must be some new product launch.

Exusiai:
Another new version? Didn't they just release one last month?

Exusiai:
You think Croissant is in line?

Sora:
You would think so, but...

Exusiai:
But?

Sora:
I'm gonna guess she's not.

Exusiai:
Why?

Sora:
She's been pretty depressed lately. She turned down my all invitations to go shopping or eat together, and she's not even taking care of her business.

Sora:
Did you know that the little warehouse she has is completely empty?

Exusiai:
Looks like she got a big shock. All that effort to learn you've been played by the manufacturer...

Exusiai:
She's not gonna just give up, is she? I haven't seen her for days.

Sora:
No idea, but I'm beginning to miss her bounciness, whether she made or lost money the day before.

Exusiai:
Me too. But the name Dainty Fragrances does sound familiar.

Sora:
See, I was right. No Croissant.

Croissant:
Evenin', folks. Might I interest you in a new flavor of crispy meatballs after a hard day of work?

Sora:
Thanks.

Croissant:
Are you guys going back? I'll give ya a ride.

Exusiai:
(Turns sideways)

Exusiai:
Ahem. Notice anything new?

Croissant:
Er... a new hairstyle?

Exusiai:
Not me. The display window behind me.

Croissant:
Oh, that. Yeah, I knew about it a week ago.

Exusiai:
Wasn't this a new product released today?

Croissant:
Heard it from Magnificent myself. I introduced 'em to Chang, and they gave me a chance to buy their new product ahead of time, at a discount.

Exusiai:
No wonder it sounded familiar... you've stocked up on the new goods, then?

Croissant:
No, I turned 'em down.

Exusiai:
Why? Isn't that a chance to make a bunch of money?

Croissant:
Nah, I decided not to get mixed up. I already got me a new sales plan.

Exusiai:
What are you planning to sell?

Sora:
Wow, these crispy meatbals are great!

Croissant:
Hehe.
