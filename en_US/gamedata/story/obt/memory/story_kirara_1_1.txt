Akafuyu:
Utage?

Utage:
Akafuyu?

Utage:
I was gonna meet up with Kirara here. You seen her?

Akafuyu:
What? The girl coming for treatment? You arranged to meet here too?!

Unfamiliar Man:
Hey, uh, guide?

Kirara:
(Raises head for a glance)

Kirara:
(Lifts phone, points it at the highway scenery)

Kirara:
(Continues tapping on phone)

Unfamiliar Man:
Ms. Guide—

Kirara:
......

Kirara:
(Taps on phone screen)

Unfamiliar Man:
Whaddaya showing me your phone for...

Unfamiliar Man:
'guide...'

Unfamiliar Man:
And then a question mark?

Unfamiliar Man:
You're not the guide who's supposed to show me outta the city?!

Kirara:
(Taps on phone screen)

Unfamiliar Man:
'no... im... not...'

Unfamiliar Man:
Then why'd you get in my car? The hell, did the L.G.D. send you?!

Kirara:
(Taps on phone screen)

Unfamiliar Man:
Quit typing and talk to me!

Kirara:
......

Kirara:
L. G... D.?

Kirara:
I thought...

Unfamiliar Man:
Clearly now!

Kirara:
I thought you were... the driver taking me to Rhodes Island...

Utage:
'Scuse me, you see a girl dragging this giant case around here?

Male Passerby:
A girl with a giant case? Can't say I have.

Female Passerby:
You're an hour late, you only just got here! Of course you haven't seen anything!

Female Passerby:
Miss, are you talking about a teenaged girl towing a big suitcase, about as tall as you?

Utage:
Yeah, her! Was she, like, super-absorbed in a hand thingy playing a video game when you saw her?

Female Passerby:
Can't say as such.

Utage:
Come again?

Female Passerby:
She was playing on something that seemed like a game console for a little bit, but then she put it away really fast, and pulled out her phone right after, and she'd just type and then send photos.

Utage:
Phone?

Utage:
(Her phone's gonna be from Higashi. Can she use it in Lungmen?)

Utage:
(Nah, no time to sweat that.)

Utage:
Should be her, for sure. Do you know where she went?

Female Passerby:
A car just stopped in front of her a moment ago, and then the driver and her had this look between them, and she took her suitcase and got in. The driver even moved it into the boot for her.

Utage:
Where's the car headed?

Unfamiliar Man:
Unbelievable...

Unfamiliar Man:
My goddamn luck. The guide I book just so happens to be a young Ægir woman in a Higashinese outfit... How the hell does a stumbling block like you come outta the woodwork?!

Kirara:
Um...

Unfamiliar Man:
If you got something to say, then say it!

Kirara:
I just wanted to ask... why... you thought I was wearing Higashinese clothing?

Unfamiliar Man:
Huh?

Unfamiliar Man:
You're garbed up like you walked right outta one of them Higashinese mangos. If that's not the look, what is?

Kirara:
I think you only really look stereotypically Higashinese if you dress like a samurai or a miko or...

Unfamiliar Man:
Samurai? Miko? Isn't that all just manga stuff? They really got types like that walking around over there?

Kirara:
Uh... never mind.

Kirara:
What are you... driving this... fast for?

Unfamiliar Man:
Huh? I'm trying to get home!

Kirara:
See, but was gonna meet up with a friend and she was waiting literally where I got in this car... and could you just take me back before you go home?

Unfamiliar Man:
Fuhgeddaboutit!

Kirara:
......

Kirara:
Orrr... where do you live? You could go home first and then I'll find a way to get my friend to pick me up...

Unfamiliar Man:
My home's in Siracusa. That good enough for you?

Kirara:
S-S-Siracusa?!

Kirara:
That's NG, that's totally not happening! I came here all the way from Higashi, I don't have time for a trip to Siracusa too!

Unfamiliar Man:
Grgh.

Unfamiliar Man:
See this knife here, ragazza?

Kirara:
Don't tell me you're with... the mafia? The <i>Siracusan</i> mafia?!

Unfamiliar Man:
Not exactly... but yeah, something like that.

Unfamiliar Man:
You sit tight and make peace with it. You're my hostage now.

Kirara:
But... you said you missed your guide, so even if you leave Lungmen you still...

Unfamiliar Man:
Shut it! I ain't giving you no second chance!

L.G.D. Officer:
That stupid pickpocket didn't just rob a jewelers, he went and nabbed a hostage...

L.G.D. Officer:
Truly sorry, Miss Akafuyu, that we requested cooperation with Rhodes Island on this investigation and still let this mess happen, and we got your friend involved in it.

Akafuyu:
Save those words for later! What step are you at in your measures?

L.G.D. Officer:
We've already sent officers to every expressway and city exit so we can conduct vehicle-to-vehicle inspections...

Unfamiliar Man:
......

Unfamiliar Man:
Clammin' up again? What gives?

Kirara:
(Lifts up handheld device)

Unfamiliar Man:
You're in the world's nuttiest situation and you still got time to play video games?

Kirara:
(Nods)

Unfamiliar Man:
You don't got a lick of sense.

Unfamiliar Man:
What, sick of games now? On your phone again?

Kirara:
...I brought this phone from Higashi.

Unfamiliar Man:
So?

Kirara:
I can't use a Higashinese phone in Lungmen.

Unfamiliar Man:
Huh.

Unfamiliar Man:
Lemme see what you're typing there.

Kirara:
?!

Kirara:
No!

Unfamiliar Man:
Clam it and give me the phone!

Kirara:
No way! Never ever!

Unfamiliar Man:
You give me that—

Unfamiliar Man:
Cazzo, a traffic jam?

Unfamiliar Man:
Great, perfect. I got my hands free now, ragazza. You give the phone and let me see. If you're not blabbin' to nobody about nothing, we won't have a problem.

Kirara:
I promise you, I'm not doing anything that would be unbeneficial to you!

Unfamiliar Man:
The hell's a promise do? If promises meant shit, would I have gotten duped all the way out to here?

Unfamiliar Man:
Just give me the damn phone!

Kirara:
I'm gonna lock it first, okay?

Unfamiliar Man:
No, you're not—

Kirara:
I think whoever's in the car over has been staring at us!

Unfamiliar Man:
What?!

Unfamiliar Man:
Merda!

Kirara:
I'm not typing anymore, I'm putting the phone away, I'm gonna keep playing games, okay?

Unfamiliar Man:
......

Unfamiliar Man:
......

Kirara:
...Ah.

Unfamiliar Man:
Okay, you've been going 'ah' every coupla minutes and nothing else. What the hell is it?

Kirara:
I, uh... I've died four or five times on this stage. I... I think I'm tilted.

Unfamiliar Man:
Am I messing you up here?

Kirara:
No...

Kirara:
(Instinctively pulls out phone)

Unfamiliar Man:
The hell you think you're up to?!

Kirara:
Sorry—sorry! I just did it automatically!

Unfamiliar Man:
Huh.

Unfamiliar Man:
Once I'm back in Siracusa, I'll let you go, and you can text your texts, game your games, nobody'll bother you.

Kirara:
You're seriously going back to Siracusa?

Unfamiliar Man:
The hell else am I gonna go? Cousin sent me packing to Lungmen like a dumbass, said business here was honey and wine... Whose honey? Ain't no business worth nothing!

Unfamiliar Man:
I'm telling you, they baited him in, he joined up with a famiglia, and figured he'd get his own little errand boy!

Unfamiliar Man:
I spent months holding my breath, following him and his business around until I was drowning in all their petty shit. Said I wanted to go home once! Just once! And he robs a jewelry store, pins all the charges on me!

Unfamiliar Man:
I ain't about to throw away decades a million miles from home!

Unfamiliar Man:
I got my mamma and papà in Siracusa! They were begging me like crazy before I left, but I was stupider than bricks, and not one word, I didn't listen to one word they said...

Unfamiliar Man:
I just wanna go home, wanna see them! One more time! And if the powers that be say I'm a coward and decide to sink me into a river, then that's the price I gotta pay!

Kirara:
(Habitually pulls out phone and begins typing)

Kirara:
(Quietly) Honestly... I don't wanna be away from home either.

Kirara:
(Quietly) I went through a lot of my own pain getting out here, all the way from home...

Unfamiliar Man:
Come again?

Kirara:
Nothing.

Kirara:
You don't have a guide, though, even... Are you really gonna make it back to Siracusa?

Unfamiliar Man:
Whaddaya want me to do? Ask the L.G.D.?

Unfamiliar Man:
Sure, I got duped, but I'm still a mafioso. What, a suit walking right up to the fuzz? Saying 'I got set up?' You think they'll listen?

Kirara:
If they don't wanna listen to you, then it doesn't matter how much you tell them, they're just gonna go by their preconceptions so they can misinterpret whatever you say. I know that.

Unfamiliar Man:
Okay, see, I thought you were just gonna risk your life begging me to 'explain the situation' to an L.G.D.

Kirara:
But, uh, even if you can't convince them, you're probably not gonna die... On the other hand, if you run into trouble in the wasteland then you're definitely never making it back.

Kirara & Unfamiliar Man:
......

Unfamiliar Man:
Hold on.

Kirara:
Huh?

Unfamiliar Man:
Hold on, that—is that an L.G.D. roadblock?! Are they checking cars?!

Unfamiliar Man:
Hey, and I see you pulled out your phone again, huh?!

Unfamiliar Man:
You were sending the L.G.D. a nice little tip-off after all! Gimme that damned thing—

Akafuyu:
Cease!

Akafuyu:
Kirara, get out of the car now! We're Rhodes Island operators, we're here for you!

Unfamiliar Man:
God damned L.G.D. laphounds!

Akafuyu:
Kirara, grab my hand—

Akafuyu:
What is it? Why are you frozen? This is an urgent situation; whatever it is, you can save it for later!

Kirara:
But—

Utage:
Relax, Kirara, I got your collection out the trunk already. You get out of the car with Akafuyu. L.G.D.'ll take care of the perp!

Kirara:
Utage?!

Kirara:
A—Alright!

Utage:
(Sighs)

Utage:
Okay, guy kinda gave us the runaround, but you're alright, the luggage you were protecting the whole way's fine, it's all good. Medetashi, medetashi.

Utage:
Kirara, hello?

Utage:
I know you're in shock, but, like, you're gonna block traffic if you keep standing there, okay?

Kirara:
Oh! Sorry...

Utage:
You got your fruit tea, you've tried Lungmen's famous finballs. I bet you feel calmer now, right, girl?

Kirara:
Um... mmhm. Thanks, Utage.

Utage:
Lemme get you introduced. This real samurai-vibey lady's Rhodes Island Operator Akafuyu. Should've been her sitting in the car, actually, with the robber guy.

Kirara:
Why?

Utage:
She's the whole 'guide' he was talking about.

Kirara:
The... young Higashinese-dressed Ægir woman... he was looking for... was her?

Akafuyu:
Indeed. The L.G.D. has been following him, but scared of alarming him, they had me act the guide, so he could be seized at an opportune moment.

Akafuyu:
Who knew I'd be so careless, and even draw you in, Kirara. I am truly sorry to startle you.

Kirara:
It's... alr...

Kirara:
(Habitually fishes out phone)

Kirara:
Huh?

Kirara:
(Alarmedly rummages for phone)

Utage:
It's not polite to send your thanks via text if they're right in front of you, girl.

Kirara:
N—No... I left my phone in that car!

Utage:
Chill, we'll pick out a new one for you in a bit. Call it a little get-well-soon.

Kirara:
But I've got a lot of important stuff on that phone, and I mean really, honestly important stuff!

Utage:
You got, like, game cheat codes on there? Or some kinda training notes so you can beat the super tough guys?

Kirara:
Okay... yes, both of those are in there but I don't mean them!

Kirara:
Utage, can we follow that car?

Utage:
Akafuyu?

Akafuyu:
This pursuit is in the L.G.D.'s hands now. If we give further chase, I fear we'll simply make trouble for them.

Kirara:
......

Utage:
She looks anxious for real to me.

Utage:
I know her, and I don't think losing her entire collection forever in that car would, like, get to her as bad as this.

Utage:
Right, Kirara?

Kirara:
(Fiercely nods)

Akafuyu:
If so, it's not as if we can't send word to the L.G.D. Where should we look for him, however, given he raced away from the checkpoint?

Kirara:
That's—no worries, I can handle that...

Utage:
You go, Kirara. What, you can pin your phone's location on your handheld or?

Kirara:
Actually, I modded all my electronics before I left so I could protect against losing anything, so they've all got relative tracking functions to each other...

Utage:
Whoa, you got even crazier at modding tech stuff and I never knew!

Kirara:
Anyhow, that red point that's been moving the whole time is my phone's position, so it looks like that guy hasn't realized I left it in his car yet...

Akafuyu:
Given so, we have an easy in.

Akafuyu:
Utage, your classmate here is by no means of ordinary ability.

Utage:
Preach it. All of my friends are showstoppers. I know that best.

Kirara:
Haha...

Kirara:
Straight for five hundred meters and then take the next right.

Utage:
The way you've been, like, looking at the map on your console and then giving directions, it's kinda like you're playing a game.

Kirara:
No, that's not really what's going on, I'm just... just looking at a map.

Utage:
This is no time for modesty, girl.

Voices From Far Away:
...resisting...

Voices From Far Away:
...give yourself up...

Akafuyu:
No mistake. We've made dead heat on the target!

L.G.D. Officer:
Stop resisting! Lay your weapons down, put your hands up and come out!

Unfamiliar Man:
I don't want none—none of you near me!

Unfamiliar Man:
Let me go, I wanna leave Lungmen, I'm going back to Siracusa, I wanna go home!

L.G.D. Officer:
Let it go! Now lay your weapons down, and we can still approach you with an open mind!

Unfamiliar Man:
Like hell! I know what you're gonna do to me—I ain't no fool! I'm going home, dammit, I just need to get out of here and back to Siracusa!

Unfamiliar Man:
First that stupid cousin, then the 'famiglia,' and now you, and that girl just earlier, you're all out for blood! You're all filthy liars!

Unfamiliar Man:
I want you all gone! Get out of my goddamn way! You're not fooling me no more! I'm going home!

Utage:
Shoot, I think he snapped.

Utage:
This is kind of a stalemate, so the L.G.D. are gonna go to force soon. I don't think we can guarantee your phone'll survive a firefight, and that guy is, like, the world vs. him at this point.

Utage:
Akafuyu, you think we can slip in?

Akafuyu:
Absolutely not. The L.G.D. cannot ensure our safety should we intrude over the cordon. We can only pray the man calms down soon.

Akafuyu:
I did ask the L.G.D. His jewelry store robbery had no casualties, which should mean they take him into custody.

Utage:
Ugh, yeah, custody beats dying any day. So when's he gonna realize it, again?

Kirara:
But he... said he was framed.

Utage:
Huh?!

Kirara:
While we were in the car he told me, he didn't actually rob that store, he was set up by somebody else.

Utage:
Did he actually, factually say that?

Kirara:
Yeah...

Utage:
Akafuyu, could you tell that to an L.G.D. guy for us, please?

Akafuyu:
I could, no issue, but the L.G.D. wouldn't let him walk on a single person's testimony.

Utage:
Still better than watching everyone fry right now! Go!

Akafuyu:
Understood!

Utage:
Maybe they'll change up their gameplan once they find out. Fingers crossed.

Utage:
Let's get outta here for now, Kirara. I mean, you can tell, but we're just counting on other people at this point.

L.G.D. Officer:
Final warning! Drop your weapons!

L.G.D. Officer:
If you still refuse to comply with the law, we will authorize the use of force!

Unfamiliar Man:
Damn you all to hell! I get it, you just wanted me here all along so you could take my life!

L.G.D. Officer:
I'll count to ten! If you won't give yourself up before then, we WILL use force!

L.G.D. Officer:
One...

Utage:
Shoot, I don't think she's gonna make it. Hey, Kirara, you might wanna prep mentally to...

Utage:
Kirara? What are you doing?

Kirara has her handheld up, and her finger is dancing all across the screen.

Utage:
That's... not the console's interface, that's, like, beyond it. You made that? You're sending instructions from your <i>own interface?</i>

L.G.D. Officer:
Two...

L.G.D. Officer:
Three...

L.G.D. Officer:
Four...

Utage:
Are you trying to dial yourself from your console? You wanna get talking with him?

Kirara:
It's just... a wake-up call.

Kirara:
Please, please...

L.G.D. Officer:
Nine...

L.G.D. Officer:
Ten!

L.G.D. Officer:
We are authorizing the use of force, all positions—

L.G.D. Officer:
Target sighted, no weapons on person!

L.G.D. Officer:
Target is stripped of all arms...

HR Operator:
Your hospitalization procedures are all in order, Miss Kirara.

Kirara:
(Taps on phone screen)

HR Operator:
'thanks'?

HR Operator:
No problem!

Utage:
Kirara, come on, didn't I tell you? It's so rude to type when you're literally, like, face to face!

Kirara:
So... rry.

Utage:
Eh, no big. I know it was more than a day or two that got you like this.

Utage:
C'mon, lemme show you where you're living!

Utage:
Seriously, that night? Everything hanging in the balance? I thought he was gonna die.

Utage:
Honestly, after all that and the shock you went through, you're incredible. I can't believe you testified for him anyway.

Kirara:
So, did they pass his verdict yet?

Utage:
Doesn't happen that fast, girl.

Utage:
But I heard Akafuyu say the L.G.D. finished their investigation and figured out it wasn't actually him who held up the jewelry store. Now he's got charges for obstructing public duty and... something, whatever it was? I don't remember.

Utage:
Considering he also kinda got baited into the mafia too, he'll probably get a year and a half and then deported out.

Utage:
Which, like, it only panned out this way thanks to you.

Kirara:
All I did was make him notice my phone, and that was it.

Kirara:
He saw what was on there and realized I wasn't lying to him while I was in the car. Wasn't more than that.

Utage:
Seriously? Sooo what kinda spell did you put in your phone to make a hard-boiled guy like that give himself up?

Kirara:
It wasn't a spell or anything, just some super normal stuff.

Utage:
You sure?

Kirara:
Of course I'm sure!

Utage:
So normal, you won't even let me see?

Kirara:
You seriously don't need to, I'm not kidding!

Utage:
Hmm...

Utage:
Not gonna push you, then.

Utage:
Bye-bye, Kirara. Get some sleep if you're worn out, okay?

Kirara:
It's not a spell or incantation or anything, it's just...

Kirara:
Just some stuff I need to copy and mail out.

Kirara fishes out her phone, and scrolls the whole way down her drafts, until she hits the day she set out.

Since leaving that nomadic city she called home, her phone's mail service has been out of commission.

But leaving home for the first time, the girl still records everything she sees, hears, feels and thinks, no matter how big or small, in her drafts folder.

Kirara pulls a sheet of letter paper from her drawer, and copies from her drafts, going character by character, by word, by sentence.

A folder filled both with great chunks of text, and messy fragments of phrases.

Kirara devotedly copies, filling page after letter page, until she reaches the draft dated latest.

The draft abruptly ends there.

Kirara tears up the sheet that contains this draft, crumples it into a ball, and throws it on the floor.

She locks her phone screen, and on a fresh sheet of paper writes anew, 'day 34'.
