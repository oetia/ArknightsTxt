Bang!

Lively Child:
Whoa! That's amazing! You broke another record!

Stubborn Child:
Hmph. Not bad, for a grown-up.

Candid Stall Owner:
Congratulations! This plush is your prize!

Mostima:
Hell yeah!

Mostima:
Hey, Dawn Destroyer, you give this a try, too.

Lively Child:
Liberi lady, is your name really Dawn Destroyer? That's so cool!

Stubborn Child:
I think it's weird. It does sound a little cool, though. You good at shooting, too?

Fiammetta:
First off, my name's not Dawn Destroyer.

Mostima:
Our beloved leader awarded you that codename herself! You should wear it with pride.

Fiammetta:
Secondly, we're adults. Breaking records at a balloon shooting booth isn't anything impressive.

Mostima:
Come on, give it a try. It's a toy gun that works on springs. Even a Liberi can handle it.

Fiammetta:
Thirdly, the attendant looks pissed.

Still-Trying-to-be-Candid Stall Owner:
No, not at all. This is business. You win some, you lose some. Now, my Liberi friend, surely you're up for a try?

Fiammetta:
Ugh... alright.

Bang!

Mostima:
Whoa, the grand prize.

Fiammetta:
You win some, you lose some. Right?

Lively Child:
Whoa! An all-you-can-eat coupon, good for a whole year! Works at all the dessert shops in Laterano, too!

Stubborn Child:
A-Amazing! You gotta be a sniper or something at the Guards, right?!

Lively Child:
Are you a big shot from a monastery?

Not-So-Candid Stall Owner:
Y-You wouldn't happen to be... working for His Holiness...?

Fiammetta:
Thanks for the coupon, senior. I won't complain about how you tampered with the toy gun.

Trying-to-Smile-Anyway Stall Owner:
Um, ma'am... I-If you don't mind... would you... would you tell me your name...?

Fiammetta:
Me? I thought you guys already knew.

Fiammetta:
My name is...

Fiammetta:
Dawn—

Children:
Destroyer!!!

Mostima:
Dawn—

Mostima:
Destroyer!!!

Fiammetta:
Mostima, are you done?!

Mostima:
But you were having fun too.

Fiammetta:
I was just...!

Fiammetta:
*Sigh*... Whatever, suit yourself.

Mostima:
Giving in already? I thought you'd put up more of a fight.

Fiammetta:
There's no point in putting up a fight you can't win, and I was never going to win, trying to argue with you.

Mostima:
So? How does it feel to be back home? Good?

Fiammetta:
It's not so bad, if it's a once in a while thing.

Mostima:
You're actually pretty fond of Laterano, aren't you?

Fiammetta:
Who isn't? Even an idiot can tell Laterano's a paradise.

Fiammetta:
Even though you aren't allowed to stay in the city if you have Oripathy, your Lateran citizenship gets you out of most trouble.

Fiammetta:
Of course, it's a whole different story if you're unlucky enough to have sugar sensitivity, or if you're fallen.

Mostima:
Hey, I like it here too.

Fiammetta:
You like it everywhere. Honestly, you don't seem to ever care where you are.

Mostima:
There's a saying for that. 'Going with the flow.'

Fiammetta:
Right, right. You're a real charming one, Miss Nuncio, never one to stop in one place.

Mostima:
But you aren't like me, Fiammetta.

Mostima:
You have a choice.

Fiammetta:
......

Fiammetta:
So?

Mostima:
So you should at least go meet that guest of ours. He's waited a long time already.

Fiammetta:
I've got nothing to say to a Gun-Knight.

Mostima:
How about to your teacher, then?

Fiammetta:
It's been years since I graduated.

Mostima:
What about your loving nonno, then?

Fiammetta:
That's just what he calls himself.

Mostima:
Tell you the truth, I really don't want to fight over a gal with a Gun-Knight. If I end up on their bad side, I might get myself a weird codename too.

Mostima:
Anyway, now that we've been everywhere worth going in the city, I'm gonna wait for you outside.

Fiammetta:
Hey, Mostima! Mostima!

Fiammetta:
Grr, that bitch. She used Arts on me, didn't she? Why am I moving so slowly?!

Apostolic Knight:
My opinion of Mostima has just gone up a little bit. At the very least, she's a good kid who knows to respect her elders.

Fiammetta:
Gun-Knight Patrizion, it's been a while.

Patrizion:
Yes it has—

Patrizion:
The light in the darkness, the shadow in the morning light, my most beloved student, Dawn Destroyer!

Fiammetta:
I am... honored.

Patrizion:
Fia! Fia!

Fiammetta:
Looking just the same as always.

Patrizion:
Me? I so rarely hear such sweet talk out of you.

Fiammetta:
No, I'm talking about the monastery. You're wearing a helmet, Reverend Gun-Knight.

Patrizion:
As if I have a choice? Apostolic Knights are required to wear full armor on the job.

Fiammetta:
You're on the job?

Patrizion:
What? I can't come see my beloved granddaughter just because I'm on the job? That would be outrageous!

Fiammetta:
Reverend Gun-Knight, you're a Sankta, and I'm a Liberi. We are not related by blood.

Patrizion:
Enough! My Fia would never speak to me like this! When your parents left you in my care, you wouldn't have dared to be so impolite!

Patrizion:
You were only so tall back then, like a little pea...

Fiammetta:
I was already seven when I first met you.

Patrizion:
Do you remember how I taught you how to aim, how to shoot, how to calculate a bullet's trajectory? I feel like it was just last year...

Patrizion:
You were always pestering me to teach you how to use a gun, then, hah, you always came crying after you blew yourself up!

Patrizion:
It's only been a few short years, and now everyone everywhere knows my little Fia as the Hardship Overseer... No, the Sticky Shimmering... Weevil? What's your new codename again?

Fiammetta:
...Dawn Destroyer.

Patrizion:
Ah, right. I'm getting on in years. Even though I remembered it just a minute ago... Can't you settle on a single codename?

Fiammetta:
Wasn't it you miserable old men who decided I had to change my codename every month?!

Patrizion:
Did that happen? I don't recall.

Fiammetta:
Can I request to have that requirement lifted, then?

Patrizion:
Lemuen is in charge of you, now. I've got no say.

Fiammetta:
Tch.

Patrizion:
Anyway! You were so adorable then, but you couldn't be more dull these days. Even the movies you bring back are getting more and more boring.

Patrizion:
Hm... Maybe except the 'One-Armed Chainsaw Guy.' That gets three out of five stars from me.

Fiammetta:
—Phew.

Fiammetta:
So, my most respected, beloved Reverend Gun-Knight Patrizion. What did you summon me for?

Fiammetta:
I'm very busy, and I still have a lot of missions that I need to carry out.

Patrizion:
What missions? Strolling around the streets with Mostima?

Fiammetta:
My mission is to keep an eye on the fallen angel Mostima, to make sure she does not leak any confidential information to anyone.

Patrizion:
Enough, Fia. We don't have any secrets so important to keep under wraps.

Patrizion:
Besides, even if we did, how would you determine what must be kept and what's okay to reveal? You say you're keeping an eye on her, but how do you decide what crosses the line, and what's okay?

Fiammetta:
......

Fiammetta:
I'm just following...

Patrizion:
Fiammetta, I'll be honest with you.

Patrizion:
The life you lead right now is pointless.

Fiammetta:
You have no right to judge my life.

Patrizion:
I do. After all, I am the head of the monastery, your teacher, and your guardian. Above all, I know what you could've been.

Patrizion:
Right now, you're diddling away your time, idling all day, doing nothing. Worse, you aren't even enjoying your life.

Fiammetta:
But... Mostima needs my help.

Patrizion:
Fia, it's not Mostima who needs you. You are the one who needs her. You've found yourself an excuse to follow her around.

Patrizion:
This is Mostima we are talking about. She knows how to take care of her own problems.

Patrizion:
Of course, when she tries on clothes, she might need someone help her with the zippers on the back.

Fiammetta:
Patrizion, you...!

Patrizion:
Angry? Finally, you found yourself some backbone. You should know I had very high hopes for you.

Patrizion:
After all, you're my most beloved student. You were the first Liberi who could've become an Apostolic Knight.

Patrizion:
You could've taken on so much more responsibility.

Patrizion:
Now, even if I don't make it sound so scary, it's actually pretty fun to be a Gun-Knight! You're not a Sankta, and you don't have this annoying halo over your head. The helmets wouldn't give you a headache.

Patrizion:
You can't wield a gun, but we can get you a huge-ass grenade launcher just as easily.

Patrizion:
Most importantly, Gun-Knights don't have to pay out of pocket when they blow up a street!

Patrizion:
Fia, you have both talent and experience. You should come back. Laterano needs you.

Fiammetta:
But I don't want to be a Gun-Knight.

Patrizion:
That's not what you told me when you were little. You begged me to train you so that you could become...

Fiammetta:
...an adult. Just so I could know the choices I had open to me.

Patrizion:
And you chose to follow Mostima around?

Fiammetta:
At first, it might actually have been guilt that drove me to follow her around. I felt I was partly responsible for her becoming fallen. I was worried she would be so depressed that she'd truly fall.

Patrizion:
You didn't understand her well enough, then.

Fiammetta:
Right, haha. It's Mostima we're talking about...

Fiammetta:
Then, I started to think. Andoain was bound to go looking for her one day. If I stayed by her side, I would eventually get to settle my score with him.

Patrizion:
And you finally found him at the Summit of Nations two days ago.

Fiammetta:
It wasn't enough. He got away. If I see him again, I will take him in myself.

Patrizion:
Then you truly have no reason to keep following Mostima around. You could become an executor. That way, you can travel across the land on this case.

Fiammetta:
No, that's not what I meant.

Fiammetta:
After I got back this time, I suddenly realized Mostima and I have been so many places and met so many people. Set aside all objectives and purposes, and that in itself is my choice.

Patrizion:
You said it yourself: even an idiot can tell Laterano's a paradise.

Fiammetta:
Right, but if you've never been away from home, how would you know what it means to come home? There are lots of places that stir my heart more than Laterano, but there will only ever be one Laterano.

Fiammetta:
Besides, this journey actually isn't all that bad.

Fiammetta:
It's true. I don't enjoy my life.

Fiammetta:
I'm just going through it.

Patrizion:
That's not going to lead to any growth. You're just suffering for no reason.

Patrizion:
Fia, all of us want you to stay. We can easily get you a seat on the Gun-Knights' Tribunal.

Patrizion:
I'd even be okay with it if you wanted to go nuts and become a cardinal like Lemuen. I could talk to His Holiness about it.

Patrizion:
It's a lot more work than being an Apostolic Knight, but it's much better than having to bustle around outside.

Patrizion:
Or I could simply order you to stay.

Fiammetta:
You won't. You're you, after all.

Patrizion:
......

Patrizion:
Right, because I watched you grow up.

Patrizion:
It feels terrible to be old.

Patrizion:
I can feel myself going downhill, day after day. Every morning, I wake up, and I find myself worse off than the day before, and everything is leaving me behind...

Patrizion:
My friends are dying, one by one. My students are scattered all across the world. The clerics simply respect me; they rarely come talk to me.

Patrizion:
It's boring, Fia. It's very boring. All I can do these days is chew over what's left of those days gone by, until nothing is left but some fuzzy feelings, to the point that I forget what I was trying to remember in the first place.

Fiammetta:
Eight years ago, you were there outside my door when I was packing.

Patrizion:
How'd you figure?

Fiammetta:
Because you left a long list of movies in my bag.

Patrizion:
Oh, now that you mention it, I did do that.

Patrizion:
I was obsessed with the Wrankwood blockbusters at the time. I only let you go because I was too caught up in the movies, and I started regretting it the very next day!

Fiammetta:
You only regretted it because you realized that even if I was going to bring you any of those movies, it wouldn't be for several years, didn't you?

Patrizion:
That's my girl. You know me well.

Fiammetta & Patrizion:
......

Fiammetta & Patrizion:
Hahahahaha.

Fiammetta:
Haha, you just want someone to take over your work, so you can hole up in the monastery and watch movies, don't you?

Patrizion:
Maybe, but I'll eventually run out of movies to watch.

Patrizion:
When are you leaving this time?

Fiammetta:
In a bit.

Patrizion:
Why not stay a couple more days? There's going to be another blindfolded handstand shooting match in just a few.

Fiammetta:
I'll pass. I watched more than enough of those back when I was a kid. I even entered one.

Patrizion:
I remember that. You got first place. I still have the trophy in the back.

Fiammetta:
Really? You do?

Patrizion:
Looks like I'll have to watch the match alone.

Fiammetta:
Don't make yourself sound like such a poor, neglected grandparent. We both know you'll have the friars with you.

Patrizion:
Sure enough.

Fiammetta:
I heard they're making a new One-Armed Chainsaw movie. I'll bring you a copy the next time I come back.

Patrizion:
When will that be?

Fiammetta:
Probably next year.

Patrizion:
The movie will be so old by then.

Fiammetta:
At least you'll actually get to watch it.

Patrizion:
......

Fiammetta:
......

Fiammetta:
It's getting late.

Patrizion:
Right.

Patrizion:
Fia!

Fiammetta:
What is it, old man?

Patrizion:
Forget it. Never you mind. Go!

Fiammetta:
Well, then. Reverend Gun-Knight Patrizion, I shall take my leave now.

Patrizion:
Goodbye, I await your next visit—

Patrizion:
Dawn Destroyer.

Fiammetta:
I will burn your whole monastery down.

Patrizion:
Fia, it's a joke! Just a joke!

Mostima:
Phew...

Mostima:
Am I really this unlucky?

Ferocious Sarkaz Bandit:
Hah! A Sankta all by her lonesome! Looks like we're in luck!

Ferocious Sarkaz Bandit:
Tell me, how do you want to die?

Ferocious Sarkaz Bandit:
How come this Sankta has horns?

Ferocious Sarkaz Bandit:
Hah, who cares?! We'll find out after we kill her!

Mostima:
Hey, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Can we not do this?

Ferocious Sarkaz Bandit:
Begging for mercy now? Not a chance! It's because of you Sankta bastards that my boss—

Ferocious Sarkaz Bandit:
What the—?!

Ferocious Sarkaz Bandit:
Aagh!

???:
Now do you know how much work it takes to make sure everything's smooth sailing when you're out doing whatever?

Mostima:
Whoa! No way! It's the Dawn—

Fiammetta:
You aren't tired of that joke yet?

Mostima:
I'm getting there.

Mostima:
I went on ahead since I figured that'd take you a couple more days. I mean, the old man came to take his granddaughter in.

Fiammetta:
It didn't cross your mind that I could just end up staying?

Mostima:
No way.

Mostima:
You still gotta make sure I don't spill any secrets.

Fiammetta:
*Sigh*...

Fiammetta:
The old man has a message for you. Apparently he wants to do a movie marathon the next time we're back in Laterano.

Panicking Sarkaz Bandit:
W-What the hell? There's just the two of them!

Hot-Headed Sarkaz Bandit:
Let's get them!

Mostima:
Well, I'm honored.

Mostima:
I will think about it.

Patrizion:
*Sigh*... Guess I'll take a stroll.

Patrizion:
Hm? An all-you-can-eat dessert coupon? Good for a whole year?! What is this doing in my pocket?

Patrizion:
Did I win a prize? Perhaps His Holiness gave it to me a couple days ago?

Patrizion:
Oh, who cares. Time to stuff my face with sweets!

Patrizion:
She'll be back by the time this certificate expires...
