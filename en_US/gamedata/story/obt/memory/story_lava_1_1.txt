Rhodes Island Landship, Cabin No. 2, Operator Living Area

Lava:
Breathe in—

Lava:
—Breathe out.

Lava:
Empty your mind. Purge your thoughts.

Lava:
Phew...

Lava:
Alright. No problems.

Lava:
Heart rate unaccelerated, emotions holding steady. You're alright, Lava. You can do this!

Lava:
This is the one! You're gonna talk to Hibiscus without getting pissed at her!

Hibiscus:
Oh, Lava~! You're just in time!

Hibiscus:
I've prepared you a healthy meal for today too, so make sure you eat it!

Lava:
What? For hell's sakes, who'd want to eat your 'healthy meals' day in day out?!

Lava:
...Hfff...

Lava:
(No, no, Lava. Don't talk to her like this.)

Lava:
(Patience. Bring out your will of a master fortune-teller, and control yourself...)

Lava:
(Steady heart. Steady heart.)

Lava:
Phew.

Lava:
Uh, no, I mean...

Lava:
With every day being healthy meals, I'm a little tired... I'm not saying I'm fed up with you! Don't overthink it!

Hibiscus:
Haha, what's all that rubbish for? Of course I know you wouldn't be fed up with your sister~

Hibiscus:
Come on, this is today's lunch. Make sure you don't leave a single scrap!

Hibiscus:
It's been getting cold lately. Balanced nutrition is the number one defense against getting ill, don't you know?

Lava:
......

Lava:
Blugh...

Hibiscus:
Hmm? What's wrong?

Lava:
I've told... I'm TELLING you...

Lava:
Forget this fff... flavor for a moment. You know the thing I hate eating most is tomatoes, right?

Hibiscus:
Uh-huh. Why wouldn't I know?

Lava:
So why...

Lava:
—Why would you go and stuff all this boiled tomato into MY lunch!?

Hibiscus:
Aw, don't get worked up. It's because tomatoes are very nutritious, of course~

Hibiscus:
And don't think I didn't know! Don't you always sneak any food you don't like onto Kroos's plate?

Hibiscus:
And not just that, you've only been eating meat recently, without a single vegetable in sight, haven't you?

Hibiscus:
You can't be like that, you can't be picky! 'Bad kids' like you who don't listen are in need of a little stricter punishment!

Hibiscus:
I'll be watching you to make sure you eat every last bite today!

Lava:
......

Lava:
(Deep breath)

Lava:
Don't get angry don't get angry don't get angry.

Lava:
Don't get... aaaarrrghh fffor gods' sakes I can't do it I can't take this!

Lava:
Can you stop being like this ever! Don't treat me! Like! A child—!

Lava:
Ugh...

Lava:
And it all ends up like this once again.

Lava:
I didn't want to argue with her, but she's just too annoying, isn't she? Who forces people to eat what they hate like that? Urp... I still feel like I want to throw up a little.

Lava:
......

Lava:
Ugh.

Lava:
Whatever. It's my fault in the end for not controlling my temper...

Cuora:
What what what? Who's bullying you?

Cuora:
Tell me quick, I'll beat them up! Just watch me pummel any rotten bully into next week! Just liiiiiiike—this!

Lava:
Waagh!

Lava:
Stop swinging your bat around in here! That's dangerous as hell!

Lava:
Hold on, didn't the Doctor say hitting people with your bat was forbidden on the ship? Wasn't writing a whole letter enough to learn anything?

Cuora:
Oh, right! Awgh... I hate writing self reflection letters! I don't wanna write any more!

Cuora:
Oh well, that's okay, I can do it without using my bat. Look, I can smash my backpack into any baddies! My backpack's really useful! Amiya and the bosses said I was really cool and strong!

Cuora:
So don't worry, Lava, it's my turn to make the baddies learn!

Lava:
I don't worry about... look, just pause, calm down for now. Mind you don't get dragged in for another lecture.

Lava:
And nobody's bullying me.

Cuora:
Really?

Lava:
Really.

Cuora:
(Staring)

Cuora:
You're lying!

Lava:
Wha?

Cuora:
If nobody's bullying you, then why do you look like you're having a really sad time, Lava?

Lava:
Sad? Do... do I?

Lava:
No way, you're seeing me wrong! I don't—

Cuora:
Of course you do! I don't see things wrong!

Cuora:
Your eyebrows are all crumpled like that one time you were playing piano and the lid smashed into your hands! You look like you're really hurt!

Lava:
......

Lava:
You're blowing this out of proportion!

Cuora:
Am I right or not!

Lava:
Ugh.

Lava:
Fine, okay, you're right. But it's not anything that serious. *sigh* I just had an argument with that stupid Hibiscus, nothing unusual...

Cuora:
Oh, is it a Hibiscus thing again?

Cuora:
Awwww. If it's a Hibiscus thing, then I can't help you out...

Lava:
Why not?

Cuora:
Because Hibiscus isn't a baddie, right? She was really nice and gentle last time she examined me, and she gave me a little cake too! It was super tasty!

Lava:
Hmph. That's just like her, playing nice.

Lava:
What's so amazing about cakes? It's not like I can't make them...

Lava:
And with HER abilities, baking something that counts as edible these days? Do you have any idea how many times she had to fail before that?

Lava:
And she couldn't throw away anything she'd ruined, and she forced me to clean up her awful messes for her.

Cuora:
Um... um? I don't get it!

Cuora:
Does that mean you got a lot of cakes to eat?

Lava:
As if it'd mean that!

Lava:
Ugh... forget it. I don't know what I'm doing telling you this.

Lava:
Basically, if you actually had a brother or sister or whatever, you'd understand what kinds of maddening creatures big sisters are! Especially the oppressive, dictatorial ones like Hibiscus...

Cuora:
......

Lava:
......

Cuora:
......

Lava:
Hey. What's the silence for?

Cuora:
Um. How do I put this?

Lava:
Huh?

Cuora:
I think, it's really nice!

Lava:
Huh? What part of that's nice?!

Cuora:
It's really nice, the idea of having a sibling... I really wanna experience it.

Cuora:
I could ask the Doctor to be my brother or sister or something, but, it wouldn't be like it is between you and Hibiscus, right?

Lava:
Uh, that'd be, I guess... not the same?

Cuora:
Knew it...

Cuora:
......

Cuora:
Then, Lava.

Lava:
What.

Cuora:
I thought of a good idea—you just gotta make Hibiscus be my older sister!

Lava:
Pfff—!!

Lava:
*cough*, *cough* *cough* *cough*... Wh—What kind of insane idea is that?!

Cuora:
I'm not being insane, I'm saying it very seriously!

Lava:
Do you understand that, like, sisters... familial sisters are blood-related? They—Even if you wanted to, they're not something you can just give up to other people!

Cuora:
Whaaa—what does that matter? I don't care if there's no blood or whatever, right?

Lava:
You still can't!

Cuora:
Can't I really? Pleaaaase—

Cuora:
You're always saying Hibiscus is your sworn nemesis, and she's the incarnation of evil thingies, right? So if you don't want your big sister, you can just let me have her!

Lava:
That—I...

Lava:
No. In one word, no!

Cuora:
Why not?

Lava:
There isn't a why not! No just means no!

Cuora:
Spoilsport!

Lava:
Say whatever you want!

Cuora:
I don't get it. Whyyy...? Okay...

Cuora:
But for super real, then, why are you always fighting with Hibiscus, then?

Cuora:
I heard from Fang that when you just joined the squad, and you first saw Hibiscus, you almost said you were gonna quit right there. Is that true?

Lava:
What's Fang doing telling you all that...

Cuora:
So it's real?

Lava:
It's real.

Cuora:
Oh... but that's really weird, 'cause why didn't you know Hibiscus was gonna be in your squad too? Um, didn't you come to Rhodes Island together?

Lava:
What are you asking for? Where'd all this curiosity of yours come from?

Cuora:
Tell me, tell me!

Lava:
Don't—Don't shake me... Fine, fine, if I tell you you'll be happy, right? This is doing my head in, but there's not even much to hide anyway.

Lava:
Hibiscus and I did leave home together at first. However, midway, something unexpected occurred...

Lava:
As in—*ahem*—I had an argument with her halfway along, so we split up.

Cuora:
That's not unexpected at all!

Lava:
Shut up! I know it's not cool at all either!

Lava:
It was an argument about—uh—I can't remember what it was, forget it... essentially, after we argued I was pissed beyond belief, and ran off to vent some steam, and ended up going a little too far without realizing...

Lava:
I wasn't too good with telling apart wasteland geography, and I went off any sort of signed road while I was still fuming, so I... just...

Cuora:
Wait, no way? You ran too far away and got lost just like that? Alone in the wasteland?

Lava:
More or less. Luckily I came across a caravan afterwards, and they took me up close to Leithanien.

Cuora:
......

Cuora:
Lava, you...

Cuora:
You're a huge little dummy—!

Lava:
Huh?!

Cuora:
You're a dummy! You're a huge little dummy! How can anyone get so lost they go from Victoria to Leithanien? Ahahahaha—

Lava:
You're the literal last person I want to hear this from!!

Lava:
But my fortune telling didn't miss. It was my fated encounter!

Lava:
If I hadn't followed the caravan for Leithanien, I would've never met my teacher, and if he never taught me music, then I'd definitely be having a hard time learning Originium Arts now!

Cuora:
Oh, that's true. You learn Originium Arts really good and fast too...

Cuora:
The instructors and Pith all say you're great. And the elite operator sir I saw last mission, with the stiff face and the eyes like this, and the weirdly nice voice, he said so too!

Cuora:
Actually, you've been going to the training grounds every day. Is that because you're learning from that operator guy?

Lava:
Tch. I'd like to be, but when would something that good ever happen?

Lava:
How would someone as important as Master Logos ever have the time to teach me specifically? Just the couple of words he gave last time are already amazing enough...

Lava:
And what was with your description of him just now?

Cuora:
Huh?

Lava:
Don't cock your head and play dumb! He's a master, a cool and strong and eye-catching graceful mysterious composed master! You need to have a little more respect towards him!

Cuora:
Wow... I got it, I got it~

Cuora:
You really worship that elite operator sir guy, huh...

Lava:
It's not worship, it's respect! Respect for the strong!

Lava:
Hmph. There'll be a day when I become just as strong as him!

Cuora:
Uh, huuuh...

Cuora:
(But the look on Lava's face is totally like when all the nice people out at that logistics office last time saw Sora singing...)

Cuora:
(Ohh, now I get it! So this is what respect is!)

Cuora:
But, you know, I still feel really sorry.

Lava:
Sorry for what?

Cuora:
Umm... I was thinking, see, if Hibiscus became my big sister, then you'd start calling me a big sister too.

Cuora:
Sorry!

Lava:
You can dream on! Like hell I would!

Lava:
And obviously me and Hibiscus are the exact same age! Why's she the big sister and I'm the little one?

Lava:
Let me make it clear, I'm literally taller than the both of you!

Cuora:
It's nothing to do with height. Hibiscus is really caring of me, so she's a big sister to me. But I always feel like you're younger than me.

Lava:
I can't make heads or tails of what you're saying... You mean I don't care for you?!

Cuora:
Awwwwaawa stop puwwing on my face—

Lava:
Hmph. Someone should've taught you this sooner or later.

Lava:
Remember! Never judge a book by its cover, and especially not when you're in front of a Sarkaz! For a Sarkaz, age and appearance are two separate matters!

Cuora:
Oh! Are you actually like the kind of old lady that looks young instead? Just like Dr. Warfarin?

Lava:
Not quite.

Cuora:
You aren't?

Lava:
Whatever. I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

Lava:
Actually, don't tell Dr. Warfarin what you just said under any circumstances either. You will 100% be killed.

Lava:
Let's leave it at that. I still have some things to do, so I'll be heading off.

Cuora:
Ah! Where are you gonna go play, Lava? I wanna come with—

Lava:
You—are—not! I'm not off to play, and don't you follow me!

Lava:
I'm going to deal with a few matters...

Lava:
No-one's in.

Lava:
Weird. How late is it? Hibiscus should've come back at this time already...

Lava:
(Honestly. It's all that Cuora's fault with all the weird stuff she spouted.)

Lava:
('Let me have your sister.' In what universe? She's not a commodity. How would anyone ever...)

Lava:
(Spoilsport, my ass. If we really could switch and she'd stop being my sister, I'd thank every star in the whole goddamn sky! It's not like I have any choice when it comes to sibling stuff...)

Lava:
(......)

Lava:
(...For—Forget it.)

Lava:
(I shouldn't have lost my temper over today. Being wrong is being wrong. Nothing I can't recognize there.)

Lava:
(When Hibiscus gets back, I'll apologize to her—)

Lava:
Hm?

Lava:
What is this... Cake—and... a letter?

Lava:
What is she—writing something so—so sympathetic for? Doesn't she get embarrassed?!

Lava:
She really is an evil one... just too evil...

Lava:
She even apologized first before I could. That's not cool at all...

Lava:
......

Lava:
(Takes a big bite of the cake)

Lava:
Blugh. She put something weird inside it yet again.

Lava:
And she said she was sure I'd like it... hmph. It's not even sweet enough. Disqualified.

Lava:
And wouldn't she forget to eat, spending all night busy at Medical? And she tells me I don't take care of my health. She's exactly the same.

Lava:
Fine, then. In exchange for the cake, I'll need to force myself to go give her something to eat...

Lava:
Heh. You really are hopeless without me, aren't you, you huge dummy sister.
