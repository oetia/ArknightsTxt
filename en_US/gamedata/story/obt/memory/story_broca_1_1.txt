Broca:
Aosta, are we really joining this Rhodes Island organization?

Aosta:
That's right, Broca. I think it's our best option.

Broca:
There's   other places we could go.

Aosta:
I know you aren't a fan of this idea, Broca,   but, honestly, this is our best option.

Broca:
......

Chiave:
Oh, don't give me that look  , Broca.

Chiave:
If things don't go our way, all we gotta do is split.

Aosta:
Hah... I don't think it's that simple, but he has a point.

Aosta:
So how about it, Broca? Are you on board?

Broca:
...I'll give it a try.

Guard Operator:
You're finally awake.

Broca:
Where are we...?

Guard Operator:
The forest. Our team was attacked by a pack of beasts, and the two of us fell off the cliff. Remember now?

Broca:
Yeah.

Guard Operator:
......

Broca:
......

Guard Operator:
Hmph, you're not very cute, are you?

Guard Operator:
Well, I still gotta thank you. If it wasn't for you, I might've   died there on the spot.

Broca:
Don't mention it.

Guard Operator:
......

Broca:
......

Guard Operator:
Aghhhhhhhh! Fine, okay! I'm sorry I picked that bone with you yesterday. I shouldn't have said that.

Guard Operator:
I'm a little testy  , you see. I don't like it when I hear someone badmouthing Rhodes Island.

Guard Operator:
But you're new here. It's not your fault you don't know what we're like just yet. Yato really tore me a new one last night. Don't take it personally, okay?

Broca:
No, I was at fault myself.

Guard Operator:
Eh, c'mon. I did you wrong, and I'll own up to that.

Guard Operator:
Anyway, let's put it behind us. That fine with you?

Broca:
Alright.

Guard Operator:
Well, that's a weight off my shoulders. It's been bothering me all day.

Broca:
Where's everyone else?

Guard Operator:
No idea. With their skills, I'm sure they can hold their own.

Broca:
We should look for them, then... Ugh.

Guard Operator:
Hold up, bro. You shouldn't move around yet, what with how hurt you are.

Broca:
'Bro?'

Guard Operator:
Oh, that's just what I call everyone. It's more intimate. You don't have a problem with that, do you?

Broca:
Call me whatever you want.

Guard Operator:
Alright, that settles it. Let's rest up here for the time being. We'll get moving once you heal up a bit.

Broca:
But...

Guard Operator:
Eh, don't worry. Yato's there with them. She's one of the most experienced operators we have. Nothing's gonna happen to them. Let's take care of ourselves.

Broca:
Fine.

Guard Operator:
Well, you lie down here a bit more. I'll take a look around.

Broca:
Alright.

Broca:
You know how loyal I am! Why are you abandoning me, Boss?!

???:
It's because you're loyal  , Broca.

???:
All that loyalty, isn't it natural you'd die for me?

Broca:
......

Broca:
......

Guard Operator:
Yo, bro. Broca. I'm back.

Guard Operator:
I took a stroll around. This forest is huge. We gotta be a bit more careful.

Broca:
My wound's starting to get better. Let's move.

Guard Operator:
You sure you don't want to rest a little more?

Broca:
I'm good.

Guard Operator:
Right on, let's get moving, then. I have a decent idea of which way we came from.

Guard Operator:
Hey, bro, I've been wondering. What's with that saw on the back of your drill?

Guard Operator:
I don't see you using it much when you fight.

Broca:
I use this when I do retrofitting work. It's for sawing wood, among other things.

Guard Operator:
Sawing wood? So you used to be a lumberjack or something?

Broca:
No, I wasn't. I just like crafting sometimes.

Guard Operator:
Heh, I didn't expect you to be the crafty kind.

Broca:
It's nothing that amazing.

Guard Operator:
Well, bro, I just noticed there's one more thing I'm wrong about you. When we left for this mission, I thought you were the type to keep to himself. I didn't know you could be so talkative.

Guard Operator:
You should talk more. Try to express yourself if you don't want people to get the wrong idea. I mean, yesterday was the perfect example.

Broca:
I actually mean it, though.

Guard Operator:
You mean you don't trust Rhodes Island?

Guard Operator:
Man, that's what I was talking about. You just got here, makes sense that you'd be a little iffy on the place.

Guard Operator:
Really, though, hear me out on this one. You really shouldn't talk like that. The first thing you said was 'I don't trust Rhodes Island.' What kind of impression do you think that gives the rest of us?

Broca:
I don't...

Guard Operator:
Eh, stop right there, bro. I'm not trying to say you're hurting anyone's feelings or to tell you to shape up or anything. It's just, well, how should I say   this...?

Guard Operator:
You see, I used to be a mercenary, and I've worked for organizations before, too. When I first got here, it was purely transactional. I was just here to make a living.

Guard Operator:
They treat us well, and the food's not bad, but that's about it. If you'd asked me back then, I probably would've told you I don't believe in that good, charitable company bull crap.

Guard Operator:
I mean, all the big companies are basically the same. You feel the same way too, no?

Broca:
Sure.

Guard Operator:
But anyway, I've been here for a while, and I can tell. Rhodes Island is different. This is something you need to learn yourself. Ain't nobody can teach you that.

Guard Operator:
And yes, I trust Amiya, I trust the Doctor, and I trust Dr. Kal'tsit. They all won   me over.

Guard Operator:
I didn't snap because the way you were talking bugged me. I snapped because what you said was wrong. You know what I mean?

Broca:
I'm not sure...

Guard Operator:
Eh, it's all good. I'm not telling you to figure it all out right now. What I'm trying to say is Rhodes Island isn't quite like what you think it is. You should try to trust in us a little more.

Broca:
I don't remember helping out the village being part of our mission.

Guard Operator:
Huh? Oh, that? It's actually the Captain's call. If he thinks we can manage it, in most cases, we try to do something to help the locals out.

Guard Operator:
Why bring that up all of a sudden?

Broca:
No reason...

Guard Operator:
Come on... Wait, bro.

Broca:
What's wrong?

Guard Operator:
Look.

Broca:
...?!

Before the duo realize what has happened, the beasts that attacked the squad have already surrounded them.

Guard Operator:
Looks like we got   company.

Broca:
I can still fight...

Guard Operator:
Don't. You haven't healed up yet. I'll create an opening for you. Run away when you get the chance.

Broca:
I can't leave you behind.

Guard Operator:
Hey, bro, you know why I apologized to you in the first place?

Broca:
...?

Guard Operator:
I wouldn't apologize even if Yato lectured me the whole night, but you shielded me when we got ambushed. That's when I knew you were a good guy.

Guard Operator:
Someone like you will come to like Rhodes Island.

Broca:
......

Guard Operator:
Anyway, I owe you this one.

Broca:
No.

Guard Operator:
Eh, bro, don't be so stubborn.

Guard Operator:
Relax. This is nothing. I ain't gonna die.

Broca:
......

Broca simply stands there and lifts his weapon as though he didn't hear the operator's plea.

Guard Operator:
Eh, you really ain't cute at all.

Guard Operator:
I can let it slide though.

Guard Operator:
Alright, then. Stay close to me, bro. I got your back, and you got mine. We'll bust through these jackasses and make it out of here, together!

Broca:
Alright.

Just before the two of them could attack, a yelp can be heard from amongst the beasts.

Guard Operator:
Huh? Is that...?

Medic Operator:
Are you two okay?!

Guard Operator:
Oh, there you are! We're fine!

Medic Operator:
Hey, Broca, you don't look so good. Hurry. Sit down and let me take a look.

Broca:
I'm fine.

Guard Operator:
That's Yato and the rest of the gang over there, right?

Medic Operator:
Yep, we've been looking for you two ever since you fell down there. It's such a relief to find you alive.

Medic Operator:
It looks like you're hanging in there okay. We can't let our guard down, though. Let's leave this place to the others and take Broca back first.

Guard Operator:
No problem!

Broca:
Thanks.

Guard Operator:
Huh? What was that?

Broca:
Nothing.

Aosta:
So how was your first field op, Broca?

Broca:
It was fine.

Aosta:
Really? Great. I was worried you'd end up starting a fight. I guess I shouldn't have worried.

Broca:
Yeah, I think... I can give this a try.
