Rhodes Island Landship

Dormitories, outside Gavial's room

Tomimi:
Good morning, Gavial, it's time to get up.

......

Tomimi:
(She's not here...)

Tomimi:
(That's really weird. Did Gavial wake up early today?)

Tomimi:
(Maybe she's eating breakfast already. I'll check the cafeteria.)

Tomimi:
(Gavial's not here either...)

Tomimi:
(She's not sleeping, and she's not here eating.)

Tomimi:
(She probably had something important to do today.)

Tomimi:
(I don't think she had any field missions coming up, so the only place she can be is Medical.)

Tomimi:
Whuh—huh?!

Tomimi:
Wh—what's going on?!

Medic Operator:
I only overheard it from my other colleagues.

Medic Operator:
We had an emergency call last night from a nearby settlement. It's a complex situation.

Medic Operator:
We had to send out an accompanying Operator with both combat and medical experience to ensure the other operators' safety.

Medic Operator:
And out of the whole department, Gavial's the best fit for times like these.

Medic Operator:
The mission really was urgent. Every Operator who took up the call for deployment headed out right away.

Tomimi:
Why... what's...

Medic Operator:
She probably left you something, right? A message, a slip of paper, the sort.

Tomimi:
Let me look!

Tomimi:
(Turns on comms terminal)

Tomimi:
N—Nothing!

Tomimi:
But why...

Tomimi:
(Ever since we left Acahualla, she—she's never come to say hello...)

Tomimi:
Gavial couldn't have... couldn't have abandoned me again, right?!

Medic Operator:
Er, you're overthinking it...

Tomimi:
I'll go help her right now!

Medic Operator:
Wait, wait, wait, hold on! How are you gonna get there? Walk?

Tomimi:
I... I'll drive over!

Medic Operator:
Settle down. You need to get permission from the motor pool, not to mention you don't know where you're going.

Medic Operator:
And that's before we get to the part where you don't know how to drive.

Tomimi:
I—I could...

Tomimi:
I...

Tomimi:
Uwh—wuhh...

Medic Operator:
W-What are you crying for...?

Medic Operator:
Oh, come on, quit it.

Tomimi:
*whimper*...

Medic Operator:
I know you're worried for Gavial.

Medic Operator:
But you oughta know. It's Gavial, what's to worry about?

Medic Operator:
No one could ever lay a finger on her.

Tomimi:
I'm scared she'll... get... get a graze...

Medic Operator:
...

Medic Operator:
She's a Medic Operator. She can cure wounds like that herself just fine.

Tomimi:
But, what if she—

Medic Operator:
Alright, alright, you weeping here isn't gonna solve anything, is it?

Medic Operator:
Just go back and rest for a bit, settle your emotions, and do something to cheer yourself up, okay?

Medic Operator:
It was an urgent mission, but it's nothing tough. Give her, maybe, three, four days to her triumphant return.

Medic Operator:
Don't scare yourself.

Tomimi:
O—Okay...

Tomimi:
I'm sorry for being such a pain...

Medic Operator:
No harm done, ha ha. Go on, head back and relax.

Tomimi:
I will...

Medic Operator:
I didn't think going Gavialless would hit her so hard.

Medic Operator:
Must've left a deep impression on her when Gavial up left home the first time.

Medic Operator:
I've gotta remind Gavial, you tell your loved ones before you go.

Medic Operator:
Or else we'll get a repeat of this. What if Tomimi cries the department six feet under water?

???:
Something that sad could happen?

Medic Operator:
Who knows?

Medic Operator:
Take a seat, Blue Poison. Are you feeling unwell anywhere?

Tomimi:
Gavial...

Tomimi:
Gavial's out on a mission...

Tomimi:
I want to go on a mission with Gavial too.

Tomimi:
Do something to cheer myself up...

Tomimi:
What should I do? Is there anything I can do?

Tomimi:
*Sigh*...

Tomimi:
If only I could be as strong as her...

Tomimi:
Um...

Tomimi:
Um?

Tomimi:
Where—am I?

Tomimi:
I'm lost in Rhodes Island again. If Gavial finds out, she'll bonk me...

Tomimi:
(Someone's over there. Maybe I can ask her.)

Tomimi:
Um. Hello?

Passerby Liberi:
Hello, Archosauria. Is there anything I can assist you with?

Passerby Liberi:
(Graceful curtsy)

Tomimi:
Wuh, uwh-wah.

Tomimi:
(Imitates the curtsy)

Tomimi:
Hello, could I bother you to tell me where I am?

Passerby Liberi:
If you mean your specific position, we're in a corridor to the Rhodes Island hangar.

Tomimi:
Thank you, Miss Liberi!

Passerby Liberi:
Make no mention.

Tomimi:
......

Passerby Liberi:
You seem as though—you're a little bewildered. Do you need my help?

Tomimi:
I'm lost...

Passerby Liberi:
Ah, I see.

Passerby Liberi:
Where did you lose your way?

Tomimi:
?

Passerby Liberi:
I'm sorry, I seem to have asked a silly question.

Passerby Liberi:
Ahem—in that case, where do you want to go?

Tomimi:
I want... to buy a fashion magazine. I haven't read one in a long time, since leaving Acahualla. I'm feeling the itch.

Passerby Liberi:
A magazine, hmm. I understand.

Passerby Liberi:
If you want to buy magazines, take the elevator there up two floors, then turn right when you come out and go straight; after you see the little fountain, turn left, and you'll find a bookstand.

Passerby Liberi:
The prices might be a little higher than in the city, but they have stable suppliers, a varied selection, and you can order in any publications you'd like.

Tomimi:
Alright. Thank you, I'll go take a look right now.

Passerby Liberi:
Just wait one moment.

Passerby Liberi:
Before you leave, could I hassle you to assuage a small doubt of mine?

Tomimi:
Huh? Um, you can just ask, no need to be so polite.

Passerby Liberi:
Very good, I'll keep that in mind~

Passerby Liberi:
Archosauria, does the burden on your shoulders weigh on you?

Tomimi:
Burden? You mean my backpack?

Tomimi:
(Weighs backpack in hand)

Tomimi:
It's alright, it's not that heavy.

Tomimi:
It's all my specially selected treasures inside. I need to keep them close to me.

Passerby Liberi:
Can't you put them in your dormitory? That's your little slice of home at Rhodes Island.

Tomimi:
But I'd be really sad if I ever lost it.

Tomimi:
I can't let even one thing go missing. I'm better off keeping it with me.

Passerby Liberi:
Your recollections, your keepsakes, hmm...

Passerby Liberi:
Have you ever thought of putting them in a safe?

Tomimi:
No, no way!

Tomimi:
My treasures will be angry if I lock them in a box!

Passerby Liberi:
Well, then, give your dormitory a proper furnishing, and turn it into your very own museum. Maybe that'd be nicer?

Passerby Liberi:
Knowing to bear your recollections is a good thing, but perhaps in learning to unload burdens and adorn them, there's more significance still.

Tomimi:
Um, I don't really, get what you're saying.

Passerby Liberi:
It's nothing. Just a solitary Liberi's meaningless soliloquy.

Passerby Liberi:
My question has already found an answer. Thank you.

Passerby Liberi:
Ah.

Passerby Liberi:
Do you want me to guide you?

Tomimi:
No, it's okay, I think I can find my way! Thank you!

Passerby Liberi:
Then I'll bid farewell, Archosauria.

Passerby Liberi:
Perhaps we'll meet again very soon.

Passerby Liberi:
(Sargonian dialect) May your outlook be as boundless as the great forest.

Passerby Liberi:
(Graceful curtsy)

Tomimi:
(She looks like she's really in a hurry.)

Tomimi:
(Is that Liberi at the other end her sister?)

Tomimi:
(They seem really close.)

Tomimi:
(That's so nice.)

Tomimi:
(......)

Tomimi:
(I've reached the tiny fountain. Turn left...)

Tomimi:
And this should be it.

Tomimi:
Waah, Rhodes Island has stalls like this too?

Logistics Operator:
It's your first time shopping at ours, isn't it?

Logistics Operator:
The store's too cramped, and sometimes when we can't fit all our stock, the stall comes out. Of course, it's all approved and filed on record in advance. There's no shady business here.

Logistics Operator:
What are you looking to buy?

Tomimi:
I wanna buy the latest fashion magazine.

Logistics Operator:
Fashion magazines come in many varieties. See, ones for getting into pendants and jewelry, ones putting out celebrity news, ones for announcing what's trendy in clothes, and—

Tomimi:
Please give me the ones about clothes, thank you.

Logistics Operator:
This one's... all sold out on the latest issue.

Tomimi:
Okay...

Tomimi:
(I'm having the worst luck today...)

Logistics Operator:
But you're in luck. The Operator who bought the last copy's still here. If you really want to read it, you could go ask her if she'd be willing to share with you.

Tomimi:
Okay!

Tomimi:
Which one is she?

Logistics Operator:
Over there, the one with pink hair.

Logistics Operator:
She's called Blue Poison, and she's the first in to buy magazines every time. Seems she got held up today, and almost missed out.

Logistics Operator:
Go give her a shout. She'll share with you, I think—

Tomimi:
Alright, thank you!

Logistics Operator:
Wait, I'm not done, she—

Logistics Operator:
......

Logistics Operator:
Whatever, sometimes less is more.

Logistics Operator:
Maybe Blue Poison'll make a new friend this way.

Tomimi:
H—Hello... would you happen to be Blue Poison? I'm Tomimi.

Blue Poison:
(So this is Tomimi? What a fine coincidence.)

Tomimi:
(Holds out hand)

Blue Poison:
?!

Blue Poison:
You want... to shake hands with—me?

Tomimi:
Oh, I just thought, um, it's the polite thing to do and...

Tomimi:
If you don't want to, then—

Blue Poison:
(Shakes Tomimi's hand)

Blue Poison:
I'm Blue Poison. I'm very happy to meet you.

Blue Poison:
Because of... reasons... most people aren't too happy to—make contact—with me.

Blue Poison:
So I was surprised when you held out your hand. Sorry for that.

Blue Poison:
Did you need something from me?

Tomimi:
I want to borrow your magazine to read a little, is that okay? I'll give it right back.

Blue Poison:
Magazine? You mean this issue of Me Maze?

Tomimi:
Yes.

Tomimi:
I'm sorry, my Victorian isn't too good, so I can't read the words here so well.

Blue Poison:
I only just picked it up, so I haven't read it yet.

Blue Poison:
There's too many people around. Let's find somewhere to sit down and have a read at our own pace.

Tomimi:
Okay, I'll follow you.

Blue Poison:
......

Tomimi:
Um.

Tomimi:
I'm done reading.

Tomimi:
Thank you, Blue Poison.

Blue Poison:
Hm? Oh, no problem.

Blue Poison:
Miss Tomimi.

Tomimi:
You can just call me Tomimi. Adding a title to a code name is a little weird...

Blue Poison:
Ah, alright, Tomimi.

Blue Poison:
This morning... what happened?

Blue Poison:
An operator at Medical said you could've cried the whole department six feet under water.

Tomimi:
It's... kind of embarrassing to say.

Blue Poison:
You'll feel better getting it out. Give it a try.

Tomimi:
......

Tomimi:
Well, it's like this...

Tomimi:
That's the whole story, more or less.

Tomimi:
Please don't laugh at me...

Blue Poison:
Of course I wouldn't.

Blue Poison:
You know, I've heard that Archosauria never shed tears.

Tomimi:
Tears are a sign of weakness, so you can never, ever cry in front of anyone else.

Blue Poison:
But even so, you'll still cry for Gavial.

Blue Poison:
And there's nothing embarrassing about it at all.

Tomimi:
Ohh, thank you.

Blue Poison:
I see you have an interest in clothing and fashion magazines. Does your homeland have such publications too?

Tomimi:
No, but sometimes Inam would bring some from the outside for me.

Tomimi:
She's the one who does business in our place, so she always brings interesting stuff back. She taught me the outsiders' languages.

Tomimi:
After I learned them, I bought books from her to read, and I really liked the stuff in some of them, so I kind of ended up reading more.

Blue Poison:
Such as?

Tomimi:
City Beauty and other ones like that.

Blue Poison:
Mm-hm, that was a fairly notable fashion magazine for sure.

Blue Poison:
But... their works have been too streamlined, too cookie cutter. They've definitely lost a lot of their mystique... *sigh*...

Blue Poison:
I hear a few editors and photographers of theirs want to jump ship and set up their own shop. Who knows yet if that'll come to anything.

Tomimi:
You really, really know a lot about fashion, Blue Poison. You're incredible...

Blue Poison:
Not quite. I just read around, and have some of my own tastes and opinions, that's all.

Blue Poison:
How about you, Tomimi? What is fashion to you?

Tomimi:
I'm not too sure. My mother tongue doesn't have the vocabulary to talk fashion.

Tomimi:
It has plenty for hitting people, though.

Blue Poison:
Hahah...

Tomimi:
I think, fashion is probably nice-looking clothes, and simple and pretty jewelry.

Tomimi:
Acahualla doesn't have anything like that.

Tomimi:
The first time I opened that magazine was the first time I learned clothes could come in colors like that, and designs like that.

Tomimi:
Some clothes I probably couldn't ever imagine in my life, but someday or other, they'd appear in the magazines Inam was selling, and I could say for sure—

Tomimi:
—I really liked those clothes.

Blue Poison:
There you go. I'd call you knowledgeable any day.

Tomimi:
Actually, the clothes I'm wearing right now are from when I saw some I really liked in a magazine, so I worked on making the whole outfit and adjusting it myself.

Tomimi:
Although it's a little rough...

Blue Poison:
Ah, I think it's ringing a bell...

Blue Poison:
Hm...

Blue Poison:
(Opens and flips through her own personal notepad)

Blue Poison:
MARTHE... Mad Wild... Fury's Call... Swimming Suit series... Coral Coast...

Blue Poison:
Found it.

Blue Poison:
Take a look. Was it this outfit?

Tomimi:
Oh, it was!

Tomimi:
How do you know it?!

Blue Poison:
It's in my collection. Sometimes, if I meet with a design I particularly like, I'll cut it out and stick it in this notepad, and then write my own gains from it.

Tomimi:
Y—You cut them out? Won't that ruin the magazine?

Blue Poison:
It's—how do I put it... I suppose it's a personal habit of mine.

Blue Poison:
Cutting and pasting magazine pictures does spoil the print's intactness, but to me, it's a shortcut.

Tomimi:
Shortcut?

Blue Poison:
Taking all the knowledge you want most from a magazine, and putting it in one place.

Blue Poison:
And through that shortcut, it ends up in here.

Tomimi:
In your head?

Blue Poison:
Mm-hm.

Blue Poison:
This notepad I'm holding is my sixth one already.

Blue Poison:
I only ever pull out the first few to flick through when I want to feel nostalgic.

Blue Poison:
Inside them, save for memories, there's nothing left at all.

Blue Poison:
The truly important things have all gone into my brain.

Blue Poison:
They've become my aesthetics, tastes, styles.

Tomimi:
Can brains really remember that much?

Blue Poison:
Of course not. What's left behind is only the parts you least want to forget.

Blue Poison:
Such as, your choices and aspirations for beauty.

Blue Poison:
Or maybe, in your case, um—

Blue Poison:
Gavial?

Tomimi:
Oh, you're right. I definitely couldn't forget Gavial.

Blue Poison:
The most important memories, they're always in your head.

Blue Poison:
Sometimes, things are just keys for opening them up.

Blue Poison:
Once you consolidate the memories and they're like an automatic door, you'll never need the key again.

Tomimi:
That... that makes sense.

Tomimi:
Keys... treasure...

Tomimi:
Memories...

Tomimi:
......

Blue Poison:
Tomimi, have you ever tried styling outfits before?

Tomimi:
Styling? No, not yet.

Blue Poison:
Then let's go to the shops and try on some clothes, what do you think?

Tomimi:
Try them? Can—can I?!

Blue Poison:
Sure.

Blue Poison:
Though the selection's not as complete as stores in the big cities, I can take you to experience it at least.

Blue Poison:
If you don't mind, I can take us to visit a tailor, to get you even more style suggestions.

Tomimi:
I—is that—really something you can do?!

Blue Poison:
Of course. If you want, we can even have a whole outfit custom-made for you here at Rhodes Island.

Blue Poison:
(Small mutter) Although the prices aren't too customer-friendly...

Tomimi:
O—Okay, I, uh, I, I'll get ready.

Tomimi:
We're gonna try on clothes in a moment, right?

Blue Poison:
Mhm.

Tomimi:
Then I—I, I need to put my backpack in my dorm first, and then it'll be less tricky when I'm trying them on.

Passerby Liberi:
The fact you've gained awareness of this is something worth celebrating, you know.

Tomimi:
Ah, it's Miss Liberi from just before!

Passerby Liberi:
I forgot to introduce myself previously. Do forgive me for my negligence.

Astesia:
Astesia Urbica. Most usually call me just Astesia.

Astesia:
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

Tomimi:
Hello, Miss Urbica.

Tomimi:
(Holds out hand)

Astesia:
(Elegantly shakes hands)

Blue Poison:
Good afternoon, Miss Urbica.

Astesia:
Good afternoon, Blue Poison.

Blue Poison:
I want to take Tomimi to try on some clothes. If you could—

Astesia:
As luck has it, I want to pick out some new clothes for myself too. It would be my greatest pleasure to go with you.

Astesia:
As for Bibeak, I wager she's still at the bookstand, buying the print.

Astesia:
Oh, my. It seems I wagered correctly.

Blue Poison:
(You really can't get anything past her...)

Blue Poison:
I'll go give Bibeak a heads-up.

Blue Poison:
See you in a bit.

Tomimi:
(Hushed) Astesia, Miss Urbica!

Astesia:
(Hushed) What's the matter?

Tomimi:
(Hushed) You said before, about furnishing into a museum. How do I really do that?

Astesia:
(Hushed) Here. See that little water fountain?

Tomimi:
(Hushed) Mmhm.

Astesia:
(Hushed) There's a sculpted relief on top of it. Isn't it pretty?

Tomimi:
(Hushed) Mmhm.

Astesia:
(Hushed) If that fountain was your own meticulously preserved piece, would that make you feel, well, delighted?

Tomimi:
(Hushed) Um... mmhm!

Astesia:
(Hushed) And that's the way it works.

Astesia:
(Hushed) Placing beautiful memories on pedestals specially made for them—it always has the power to cheer oneself up.

Astesia:
(Hushed) If you need it, you can install further equipment on the pedestals too. You can protect things from outside damage, and greatly extend their lifetimes.

Tomimi:
(Hushed) That sounds pretty good.

Tomimi:
(Hushed) Then, if, if you have time, could I ask you to, help me, um, plan it out?

Astesia:
(Hushed) Of course.

Astesia:
(Hushed) Choosing decor has its own particularities. When you're done trying on clothes, we can take our time with research.

Astesia:
For now, we'll go meet up with Blue Poison and her friends. It would never do to keep them waiting.

Tomimi:
Okay!

Astesia:
Tomimi.

Tomimi:
What is it, Miss Urbica?

Astesia:
Do you feel in a better mood now?

Tomimi:
Yes!

Tomimi:
Doing what I like—makes me really happy.

Astesia:
Oh, that's wonderful.

Astesia:
Let's go, then.

Tomimi:
Alright!

Tomimi:
The difference between Rhodes Island and Acahualla is kind of big.

Tomimi:
There's a lot you can't do here, and the rooms are pretty small.

Tomimi:
But I don't mind it that much.

Tomimi:
I can learn so many new things, and make new friends.

Tomimi:
There's nothing that makes me happier.

Tomimi:
Maybe I can become a fashion expert, or an explorer, or a Caster.

Tomimi:
Or maybe a fashionable Caster with an exploring spirit?

Tomimi:
And what fun stuff might happen in the future?

Tomimi:
I'm really looking forward to it.

Tomimi:
I guess when Gavial chose to stay at Rhodes Island, and not in Acahualla, this was why.

Tomimi:
......

Tomimi:
I wonder what Gavial's up to now?

Gavial:
Hold still! It'll just hurt for ONE moment.

Field Operator:
Ow, gentle, you're killing me!

Gavial:
I said it'd hurt, not kill you.

Gavial:
Hm?

Gavial:
Hmph.

Gavial:
All bound up. You put some pressure on that wound, and I'll give our guests a warm welcome.

Gavial:
Hah!

???:
Urgh...

Gavial:
Hey! What's with these punks creeping up here?

Field Captain:
Sorry, Gavial! We only let that one guy slip, the others are all done and dusted!

Field Captain:
Everyone, rest up where you are, and stay vigilant!

All Field Operators:
Understood!

Field Operator:
Phew. It's finally over.

Gavial:
Yep. Long as you're all alright.

Field Operator:
Gavial.

Gavial:
Hm?

Field Operator:
You had real short notice for this mission. Did you ever send your hometown friend any regards?

Gavial:
What regards am I gonna give? I know her.

Field Operator:
Not sure about anyone else, but the one who keeps coming to Medical, same race as you, right? You could at least give her a shout.

Field Operator:
What if she didn't find you, and cried Rhodes Island under water?

Gavial:
Us Acahualla expats are all strongest of the strong. Tomimi sure as hell isn't that weak.

Gavial:
Besides, I ran some work with Astesia pretty recently. Anything happens, and she'll be there to help manage, guaranteed.

Field Operator:
Fine, yeah, you got it all worked out already. Pretend I never asked.

Gavial:
Less yapping, more helping me figure the post-mission out. Where are we linking up with the R.I. landship?

Field Operator:
Oh, yeah, one sec.

Field Operator:
Um... here.

Field Operator:
Landship'll be calling at this city for rest and resupply.

Field Operator:
Hear it's a holiday city too. Giant coastal beach in there, wide open to tourists.

Field Operator:
Thinking what I'm thinking? We can take a vacation.

Gavial:
Doesn't that work out.

Gavial:
(Holiday city... coastal beach?)

Gavial:
(How about I buy her an outfit for the waterside? She oughta like that.)

Gavial:
(Yeah. Call it an apology.)
