Mint:
......

Mint:
Phew...

Mint:
(Miranda...)

Mint:
(Everyone, including my professor—they've all written to me, and so much too.)

Mint:
(One, two, three...)

Mint:
(There're still so many pages to read. Er—someone's sent their own love diary to me too! Oh, wow...)

Skyfire:
What are you dawdling for? We're heading out!

Mint:
Ah, I'll be right there!

Mint:
(Fine, then, I'll give a proper read later.)

Mint:
(Everyone's worried about me, but I can't go back to see them just yet.)

Mint:
(I... need to work harder first!)

Mulberry:
Good afternoon, Mint.

Mint:
Skyfire! And Mulberry, good afternoon!

Skyfire:
Slowcoach! What took you so long?!

Mint:
But, it's not departure time yet... Is there a reason you're impatient?

Mulberry:
It's probably because I was grilling her with questions about Victorian universities.

Mint:
Eh? Are you interested in university, Mulberry?

Mulberry:
Y—Yes, I heard Victoria's universities are incredible, and Provence referred me to Skyfire...

Skyfire:
Hmph! Provence is nothing if not talented at getting on my nerves.

Skyfire:
But that aside...

Skyfire:
It just so happens—and don't let her dopey face fool you—that <i>she</i> is the teacher's pet of a well-renowned professor. Ask her anything you want.

Mint:
Ah, uwh, Zkyfaih, thtop pinthing my theeks—

Mint:
Oww... no more violence! Violence strictly forbidden!

Mulberry:
Haha, you two get along so well.

Skyfire:
The term is not violence, it's guidance.

Skyfire:
Enough, no more racket. Our task this time is to survey this mountain's strata. According to information gathered from nearby settlements, earthquakes have been common in this area as of recent. Danger levels are high.

Skyfire:
Protective equipment all ready? If we're in shape, we'll continue further in.

Mulberry:
Y—Yes! I'm all ready!

Mint:
I'm good too!

Mint:
I hope we collect some good sample data...!

Skyfire:
...I'm warning you, this is <i>not</i> an easygoing mission. If you run off again, I am NOT looking for you!

Mint:
I won't, I won't! I never would!

Mint:
Er, I mostly wouldn't... probably?

Skyfire:
Hmph! You'd best hope not!

Mint:
Ah! Wait for me!

Mint:
This is the region.

Mint:
If we enter via this cave, we should be able to reach our target survey site. Mm-hm, it all lines up with our previous calculations!

Mulberry:
Wow, did you work all this out? Professionals really are amazing...

Mint:
Eheheh, it's nothing, really! Have you met Eyjafjalla before? She's the real professional! And Earthspirit too...

Mint:
Ah, and Skyfire, of course! She's more famous for Originium Arts now, but back at university, she was a genius who skipped a whole year and got all these degrees!

Mulberry:
Th—That's amazing!

Skyfire:
Enough of the teatime talk. Do you have all your samples for this area? If so, we're moving to the next spot.

Mint:
About that... I just ran a quick instrument analysis on the samples we got too. Skyfire, look at this.

Mint:
It's just a rudimentary analysis, but you can see how fiercely reactive the Originium activity is in the deeper layers!

Mulberry:
Active Originium reactions in deep layers... Based on my experience, there'd be disasters of all shapes and sizes in a region like this.

Mint:
Such as... earthquakes. And moreover, the strata here seem very loose. It's a lot like before...

Mulberry:
What?

Mint:
Um? Um, no—nothing!

Mint:
It's all just conjecture right now. For a concrete analysis, I'd still need more data.

Skyfire:
Listen, now... you <i>do</i> remember why we came here in the first place, right?

Mint:
O—Of course I do! We're collecting data to finish our survey mission!

Mint:
It's okay, no worry!

Skyfire:
...I'll trust you this once. Now let's go further in.

Mint:
Skyfire, the readings here are far above ordinary figures!

Skyfire:
Mm, as expected...

Mulberry:
The structure here's very solid. We can use it as a shelter if we need to!

Skyfire:
Hmph. That's all it takes, though.

Mulberry:
Skyfire! Please don't use Arts in a place like this without warning again! It's very dangerous!

Mint:
Ahahah, she's direct like that...

Mint:
Wow! Look, over there! Isn't that the ore the Doctor mentioned before?

Skyfire:
No running off!

Mulberry:
I think that was...

Skyfire:
It's beginning to destabilize here. Action stations, fast!

Mint:
These figures were read in during that tremor just now...

Mint:
......

Mulberry:
Mint...?

Mint:
Hm? Ah, I'm alright...

Mulberry:
The footing's tricky through here... take care, both of you!

Skyfire:
...Hold on a moment.

Mulberry:
Skyfire?

Skyfire:
Mint—where is she?

Mulberry:
Eh?

Mint:
I'm sure of it, this reading! It's just—it's just the same as when the accident...!

Mint:
If I can just get the core data—

Mint:
...Skyfire? Mulberry?

Mint:
I got split up...

Mint:
Yagh!

Mint:
(Uwh... was that debris from above?)

Mint:
(Don't panic, don't panic. It's just a little sting. I've still got protective gear on!)

Mint:
(Compared to...)

Miranda:
It's rare we get to conduct an on-site deep survey! We'll get some fantastic data out this time!

Prudent Researcher:
Take caution. This site is exceptionally dangerous.

Miranda:
Oh, come on, we have protective gear on, don't we?

Miranda:
Not to mention, if we were scared of danger, we wouldn't have joined the Professor's lab, would we?

Miranda:
'In seeking the truth, I willingly brave all hazard.' ...That's our motto, you know.

Prudent Researcher:
Honestly... there's no reaching you.

Prudent Researcher:
Still, be careful at least. If anything should happen, in the worst case...

The Feline girl seals her lips, shuts her eyes, and places a hand on her arm wrapped in clothing.

Her wound, which once bled incessantly, is now only a shallow scar and minute crystals.

That was the price she paid for pursuing her own goal, and the symbol of her becoming an Infected.

Mint:
(Compared to Oripathy, this little scratch is barely anything!)

Mint:
(I made a promise...)

Mint:
(And if I let this slip, who knows when I'll be able to get data like this again!)

Mint:
(Even if it's just for Miranda, I have to...)

Mint:
(Right, first I need to send a message to Skyfire and Mulberry.)

Mint:
'...Please both evacuate to safe area, I'll come once finished gathering data...'

Mint:
...Okay, that'll do fine.

Mint:
(I should be at a fairly deep level by now. Hm... a little further forward.)

Mint:
(Urgh! The tremors are getting stronger, I have to be quick...!)

Mint:
(Just a little closer!)

Mint:
(Oh no, it's trapped the protective gear...)

Mint:
(...I can't afford to mind it!)

Mint:
(I'm so, so close!)

Mint:
(Found it! The strongest region of activity... is right here!)

Mint:
(This is brilliant, I just need some samples from here, and to get some figures, and I can start an in-depth analysis...)

Mint:
Wah! It's starting to collapse here too!

Mint:
No! I can't get...

Skyfire:
Idiot! Duck!

Mulberry:
Entrance has collapsed! Over this way!

Mint:
Ow! That hurts...

Skyfire:
I can't believe you can still tell pain—you're a living <i>headache</i>.

Mint:
S—Skyfire... and Mulberry!

Mulberry:
Exit over here!

Mulberry:
Let me say this in advance! Mint, I'm very, very angry with you right now!

Skyfire:
Save your breath, safe location first!

Mint:
Wait, my samples—

Mulberry:
There's no waiting! Move!

Skyfire:
Phew...

Skyfire:
Okay, we should be fine here.

Mint:
*pant*... *pant*...

Mint:
I'm a little... *gasp*, *gasp*... out of breath!

Skyfire:
Serves you right. Hmph. I'll have my turn with you in due time... but right now, I'm not the one who should be berating you.

Skyfire:
Take it away, Mulberry.

Mulberry:
......

Mint:
M—Mulberry...?

Mulberry:
...Separating from your team and acting alone, under hazardous circumstances...

Mulberry:
Is just asking for everything to go wrong! And far too irresponsible!

Mulberry:
What if something <i>did</i> happen to you?! Aren't you meant to be the clearest on how dangerous it is here? You can't have not considered it <i>once!</i>

Mint:
Uwh, I'm—I'm sorry! You're right...

Mint:
But, I needed to collect core data...

Mulberry:
I don't care about the data! In my eyes, nothing is more important than <i>your own safety, Mint!!</i>

Mint:
Uwwhh!

Mulberry:
No whining! No sympathy!

Mint:
I...

Skyfire:
Sorry, let me interrupt.

Skyfire:
Mint... you didn't SERIOUSLY believe you could've made it back?

Mint:
I...

Skyfire:
You still think once you finish this research up, you can apply to resume studies? You think that way, everything will go back to how it was?

Skyfire:
If that's your opinion, then give up as soon as you can. Your professor and university friends might not bear to tell you the truth, but I will.

Skyfire:
You can't go back.

Skyfire:
Victoria is nowhere near as guileless as Rhodes Island. Even if you'd gotten some breakthrough result, you'd still—

Mint:
I know!

Mint:
Stop, Skyfire. I do, I do. I know.

Mint:
But... I...

Anxious Researcher:
...Well?! What did the doctor say?

Anxious Researcher:
Is it—Is it really Oripathy...?

Mint:
Mm...

Anxious Researcher:
What for?! What are we meant to do now?!

Mint:
Forget me for now! More importantly, how's Miranda? And our data from before—

Anxious Researcher:
About that. Miranda hasn't woken up yet.

Anxious Researcher:
And the data... isn't with us.

Mint:
Eh?

Anxious Researcher:
Once you had the accident, the Professor and us abandoned the investigation and made an emergency evacuation.

Anxious Researcher:
We couldn't have just ignored you under those circumstances!

Mint:
But... but I'm sure Miranda gave me the samples! I already had them on me!

Anxious Researcher:
You were so injured! We were stuck outside and couldn't help you, and when we got you out, you were clutching your fists hard...

Anxious Researcher:
But there was... nothing in your hands at all...

Mint:
......

Mint:
I lost hold of everything then...

Mint:
I don't actually care whether or not I can go back to university!

Mint:
But I can't let this slip away from me, Skyfire...! If—If I can't get this most core data, then I...

Mint:
Then what have I persevered in surveying for, even caught Oripathy for—and Miranda—what have we done everything for...

Skyfire:
......

Mint:
That's why I have to go! I...

Mulberry:
That's not true!

Mint:
Eh?

Mulberry:
I don't know exactly what happened to you before, Mint, but I do know that right now, we're a team! And you're representing more than yourself!

Mulberry:
No matter how important your research is... Cherish yourself more, Mint, please!

Mulberry:
I don't know much about research... but Skyfire has the knowledge there. She can help you.

Mulberry:
And I <i>do</i> know full well how to respond to the dangers following an earthquake, how I can keep the two of you as safe as possible!

Mulberry:
If that's still not enough, Rhodes Island has even more dependable veterans still... Why do you even have to bear all this by yourself?!

Mint:
It's—This is what I'm meant to do!

Mint:
No matter where I am, no matter the danger, I'll continue this research!

Mint:
'In seeking the truth, I willingly brave all hazard'... I swore it, when I joined the Professor's research lab! So I have to...

Mulberry:
No! That's not right!

Mulberry:
I can understand you're pursuing the truth as a researcher, but it's in no way—no way at all, a duty you <i>have</i> to assume!

Mint:
......

Skyfire:
In this respect, Mulberry is right.

Skyfire:
Mint, your professor and your fellows have all written you letters, haven't they?

Mint:
The Professor's... letter...

Skyfire:
Yes, the letter. You brought it with you today, didn't you?

Skyfire:
Have none of those letters mentioned it, really? They even got in touch with me, for how uneasy they were.

Mint:
Miranda... Miranda woke up...?

Mint:
......

Mint:
There is one! There's a letter from Miranda!

Mint:
Er, ah...

Mint:
Uwh... th—thank goodness...

Skyfire:
What are you crying here for, of all the places? You're hopeless...

Skyfire:
Well? Are you still going to insist on throwing yourself into the fire, even now?

Mint:
I... I've always felt, *gulp*... it was—it was my fault, I lost the samples Miranda staked her life on getting...

Mint:
So I had to... I had to...

Mulberry:
It sounds like this was a very complicated accident...

Mulberry:
No matter what, though, Mint, don't do this again! No more going around without caring about your safety!

Mulberry:
And no more making so much trouble! If you need it, we'll... all of Rhodes Island will help you out! We'll find a way!

Mint:
*sniffle*... Wuhhh...!

Mint:
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm sorry you all had to worry over me again!

Mint:
Ca... Can I still do in-depth geological data collection next time, then?

Mulberry:
A—As long as you take appropriate measures, and don't act arbitrarily...

Skyfire:
Hey. Don't let her fool you. She doesn't look like she's learned a damn lesson to me.

Mint:
'Thank you for always looking out for me. I'll look out for myself at Rhodes Island, and continue my research...'

Mint:
Hm... alright, I think that'll do it!

Skyfire:
Here you are! I've been looking for you all day.

Mint:
Skyfire!

Mint:
What do you need me for? Is something the matter?

Skyfire:
Didn't you tell me you wanted some reference literature? I've found you a few papers along the lines of your abstract. Also, some that might be unrelated in terms of content, but I feel the research methods are worth consulting.

Skyfire:
Yes, all here. Take your pick.

Mint:
Skyfire... are you saying—this is all for me...?!

Skyfire:
Hold it! I just had the chance to look while I was checking over documents, don't you get... wraagh!

Mint:
Skyfire! Listen to me... I've run my in-depth geological stratification analysis! Ohhh! Eyjafjalla commended me, too!

Skyfire:
Really? Let me see!

Skyfire:
Well, isn't this a job well done...

Skyfire:
I'm assuming you didn't go adventuring again for this data? Hm?

Mint:
Not at all! I applied for a mission, and worked alongside the other operators, all properly!

Mint:
I have it figured out now! No matter what, I'll continue doing the research I want to do!

Mint:
I still have so many things I'm curious about, so many phenomena I want to figure out... I won't leave anything unfinished no matter the results!

Mint:
But I don't want to worry everyone either! I won't get carried away like that again!

Mint:
Not to mention I'm going to pay a friend a visit sometime soon, too...

Mint:
If I'm overly exhausted or hurt by then, it'll be awfully embarrassing for me to meet her!
