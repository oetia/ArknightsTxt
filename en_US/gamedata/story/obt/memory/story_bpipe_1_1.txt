Lungmen District 7, City Gateway

L.G.D. Officer:
Inspector Hoshiguma, you're finally here!

Hoshiguma:
Hey, you sent me a message to get out here right when I was taking my shoes off, kid. Had to scramble across half of Lungmen in the dead of night.

Hoshiguma:
—So, what's with your perp?

L.G.D. Officer:
Ahem, we, we apprehended her! She's in a holding cell for now.

Hoshiguma:
So you got her? How many did it take?

L.G.D. Officer:
Er, it was just me and another guy on duty...

Hoshiguma:
You said she's a Victorian soldier... packing a pretty intimidating weapon too.

L.G.D. Officer:
I don't get it either...

L.G.D. Officer:
Before me and Ping even got close, she just dropped her weapon, stuck her hands way up and started yelling 'right here,' like she was worried we couldn't even see her.

L.G.D. Officer:
Inspector, I've been on this gateway for a couple years now. I've never seen someone try to cross in like this.

Hoshiguma:
No worries, I'll go see what her deal is.

Hoshiguma:
Oh, right, you said in the message she was yelling something too?

L.G.D. Officer:
She's out there trying to speak mandarin Yanese, and not too well at that... but it sounded like she was saying, uh, Ch'en... Ch'en?

L.G.D. Officer:
I might've just heard it wrong.

Hoshiguma:
Ah... ha.

Hoshiguma:
Alright, I'm up to speed.

Bagpipe:
Uwagh, that's bright—oh, did someone finally come?

Hoshiguma:
Yeah, I've got a few questions to ask.

Bagpipe:
Is this... an interrogation?

Hoshiguma:
Counts as one, I guess.

Bagpipe:
*sigh* It was always me doin' the interrogatin' before. Suddenly the tables are all turned. Honestly, it's a new feelin' to me.

Hoshiguma:
So you handed in your weapon all nicely... Didn't want to run?

Bagpipe:
Ought to be a fair deal simple gettin' out of here, really... even without the Fortcracker...

Bagpipe:
*cough* *cough* No, not that I mean to! Clean forgot you're interrogatin' me... um, I've got no thoughts of runnin' at all! I kept here voluntarily!

Hoshiguma:
Why? Hard to meet anyone who likes squatting in prisons.

Bagpipe:
I mean, I don't really want to be shut up. Just, I heard if I barged my way in the gate, police'd come arrest me... they're called the L.G.D. in Lungmen, right?

Bagpipe:
I was lookin' for someone, so, quickest method possible.

Hoshiguma:
Find who, exactly?

Bagpipe:
Chenchen... I mean, right, Ch'en. She's in the L.G.D., right? I think she's already a... superintendent?

Bagpipe:
Ugh, what a shame. I thought she'd come over herself once she got the news, see.

Hoshiguma:
What relationship do you and this supposed Superintendent Ch'en have?

Bagpipe:
We're best friends. We were classmates, back when she was at school in Victoria.

Hoshiguma:
Which school?

Bagpipe:
Er, the Royal Guard Academy.

Hoshiguma:
In that case, you're an officer?

Bagpipe:
...I was before I left.

Hoshiguma:
A retired Victorian officer, in uniform, gatecrashing a border city of another nation, with a standard weapon to boot—

Bagpipe:
Minus the bit where it fires shells! That part's removed!

Hoshiguma:
But with the chambering system retained, it still has massive blast force. Am I right?

Bagpipe:
(Quietly) Goin' by the rulebook, I really should've handed it in to the brass...

Hoshiguma:
Which is to say, you didn't have an ordinary retirement?

Bagpipe:
............

Bagpipe:
Well, that question came fast.

Bagpipe:
Ugh, if I knew this day was comin', I would've tried a little harder back in interrogation theory.

Hoshiguma:
Are you that keen on covering up the details of your retirement? Miss, if you're a deserter, then I should be on the phone already.

Bagpipe:
No, please don't call anyone—

Bagpipe:
I—I really am out of the force, I can promise you that!

Bagpipe:
I'll try and explain, but—there's some info I just... am not at liberty to reveal here.

Hoshiguma:
Go for it, then.

Bagpipe:
Alright, here's the thing. Three months ago, I was still in the army, and our team was trackin' this case.

Bagpipe:
Durin' our investigation... um...

Bagpipe:
I can't say anythin' but, because of this case, out of our team, the only one presently still alive... no, still able to freely operate is me, now.

Hoshiguma:
I'm sorry. It must be rough to remember.

Bagpipe:
Thank you for understandin'.

Hoshiguma:
That said, I'm not clear on something. You almost gave your life, so shouldn't the old Victorian Army fogies have been covering you in medals?

Bagpipe:
You mean, gettin' decorated? Forget it, the investigation's not complete. That never even crossed my mind.

Bagpipe:
But at the very least... I thought they could send a few more hands to help me stay on the trail.

Hoshiguma:
And they didn't?

Bagpipe:
Really floors you, doesn't it? Officer, I make less sense of it than you do.

Bagpipe:
I started out searchin' for all kinds. Started from County Peninsula's barracks, and all of them were trippin' to placate me, havin' me wait for orders from above, pledgin' I'd have more hands ASAP.

Bagpipe:
And I heeded that. In the end, I realized I was just wastin' more and more time, and the investigation was dead in its tracks for it. So, I decided to circumvent the place's barracks, and get straight in touch with Londinium.

Bagpipe:
Wasn't too easy doin' it, but luckily I'd already built up a little experience on how to deal with barracks, and you'll always run into good people on the way forward.

Bagpipe:
Finally, I made it in one piece to the closest camp to Londinium—

Bagpipe:
And there, I made my decision to retire.

Hoshiguma:
Because they still didn't help you?

Bagpipe:
Commanders, counts, the grand dukes... they probably had other concerns. They told me so, at least, and there I was swallowin' it all, right until the day...

Bagpipe:
I accidentally overheard. A lieutenant colonel with some other officer I didn't recognize, discussin' what to do with me.

Bagpipe:
Aye. I never thought—

Bagpipe:
Thirty-seven whole days past the event, and I wasn't sittin' waitin' for any reinforcements. Only an order to transfer.

Hoshiguma:
...

Hoshiguma:
This can't have been easy for you.

Bagpipe:
Mm... I feel a right mess inside. Is it hurt? Or disappointment, or anger... I can't even say.

Bagpipe:
When I learned, my brain just went pure white. Only thought I could keep was I was glad I left my spear in the trainin' room, and didn't have it to hand.

Hoshiguma:
Otherwise, you would've done something?

Bagpipe:
Wouldn't have, really... probably. After all, I've always remembered my own duty.

Bagpipe:
And just the same, as a Victorian serviceman, I had to obey orders.

Bagpipe:
But... in that moment, I realized I couldn't do it.

Hoshiguma:
Armies don't much care for insubordination.

Bagpipe:
Aye. And with that, I settled on it pretty quickly. I'd leave the army myself before they decided where I ought to go.

Hoshiguma:
Did they agree to let you go?

Bagpipe:
Retirement procedures went smooth enough. Leader and Chenchen used to complain how stubborn I was. Of course a lieutenant colonel and his lot couldn't do a thing to stop it.

Bagpipe:
But, when I was at the camp to hand my weapons back in, I got ambushed.

Hoshiguma:
A surprise attack? From who? The one you were after?

Bagpipe:
It's very likely.

Bagpipe:
I've gone over it in my head. Why would they choose to act at the barracks, when they clearly didn't care for a whole month about me...

Bagpipe:
Maybe the enemy sneaked their way into army admin, in the end? Or maybe just from the start...

Bagpipe:
Ugh, none of it matters anymore.

Bagpipe:
I fought a few off, but they had masses of people. Couldn't help but pick up my spear and hurry on my way out.

Hoshiguma:
And then? That's how you fled Victoria?

Bagpipe:
Fled's... not wrong. Haha. It's been real rough and tumble comin' all this way.

Bagpipe:
I know how tall an order it is to deal with those bunch. Didn't dare go home, naturally. Didn't want the ghosts gettin' my mum and them caught up too.

Bagpipe:
Goin' back to the army's even more out of the question, and I'd just be hasslin' the police if I went to them. Kept waverin', thinkin' for an answer...

Hoshiguma:
You could only turn to classmates?

Bagpipe:
Mm, that's right. Chenchen promised, if anythin' happened to me, I could go find her!

Hoshiguma:
Ha ha.

Bagpipe:
Er, officer, what are you laughin' at?

Hoshiguma:
It's nothing. So, you came to Lungmen.

Bagpipe:
That's where she is for certain. I haven't got it wrong, have I? Her New Year message last year came from this place and all.

Hoshiguma:
Let's keep talking about why you broke past our gateway.

Hoshiguma:
No matter if you've got people hunting you down, you're a Victorian citizen anyway. You're not telling me you can't even buy a ticket somewhere?

Bagpipe:
...I honestly can't.

Hoshiguma:
Huh? Professional Victorian servicemen take home less than Lungmen street stalls?

Bagpipe:
Err, that's not it.

Bagpipe:
I, um... lost my wallet and passport both in Leithanien.

Hoshiguma:
You might be my kinda girl, huh...?

Bagpipe:
—They got blown to nothin'. Not even cinders left.

Hoshiguma:
You're definitely my kinda girl.

Bagpipe:
Not just the wallet, I was a hair from bein' sent flyin' too.

Bagpipe:
I'd only just left Victoria at that point. Rubbed shoulders with a caravan car crossin' Leithanien.

Bagpipe:
Hadn't been in the country for two days when the car passed this wee city. The local viscount was a fair deal happy to welcome us, and even set us up in the nicest inn and all.

Bagpipe:
When it came evenin', the others went to this meal, and I stayed by myself in this whole luxury suite they gave me. Waiter gave me a supper meal, totally complimentary.

Bagpipe:
I had a few bites. Always felt Leithanian food was too refined for me, never much suited my palate. Just wanted to go outside and find a farmer's market to saunter about for a while.

Bagpipe:
Didn't think as soon I was downstairs, there'd be a boom, and the window frame for my room'd go crunch right in front of me. Completely mangled up, too.

Hoshiguma:
That's an intense explosion for sure.

Bagpipe:
It was! Even I might've lost my life if I got blown out a window ten floors up, y'know?

Hoshiguma:
...Only might've?

Bagpipe:
It's serious, look, I swear! Honestly didn't expect to be so in for it even in Leithanien.

Hoshiguma:
Hm. Your mind and body both seem much sturdier than that poor window frame.

Bagpipe:
Eh? Thanks... for the praise?

Hoshiguma:
Come to mention it, do you know who tried to blow you up?

Bagpipe:
No idea. I'd only been with the caravan for a few days, pitchin' in my strength. Shouldn't have made any enemies, right?

Bagpipe:
Actually... I'm not that worried about gettin' an answer to that question.

Bagpipe:
Ever since I started investigatin' this case, the riddles have piled on up, and there's been no moment of clarity at any point. Gotten used to it already.

Hoshiguma:
So, by coming to Lungmen, you were hoping to lean on your friend?

Bagpipe:
Oh, I'm not lookin' for others to protect me, no. I just wanted to ask Chenchen if she'd be willin' to help me.

Hoshiguma:
Oh? You still want to go back to Victoria to finish the job? Even with so many people out for you?

Bagpipe:
Right you are.

Hoshiguma:
Not a single hint of hesitation, either.

Bagpipe:
(Exhale—)

Bagpipe:
It's been a few months for me, goin' from Victoria to Lungmen. Suppose I had even the slightest hesitation, I couldn't have gone this way.

Bagpipe:
I promised, I'd get the truth of it all out for all to see.

Bagpipe:
If I don't know where that truth is, I'll go lookin'—

Bagpipe:
If the enemy don't want me talkin', then I swear I'll talk.

Bagpipe:
I left Victoria without lookin' back. But if I'm all readied to return one day, then I will not waver one step.

Hoshiguma:
You're not scared?

Bagpipe:
I am.

Hoshiguma:
Right. I believe you.

Bagpipe:
Eh?

Hoshiguma:
Warriors who keep saying they're not scared of dying are either bluffing, or they haven't gotten it yet.

Hoshiguma:
I think you've made the preparations you need to, and I believe you aren't lying.

Bagpipe:
So, in that case, can you help me get in touch with Che... Superintendent Ch'en?

Hoshiguma:
Here, there's a few cha siu baau in this bag. They're pretty much cooled. If you can put up with that, they're edible. I'm guessing you're starved after running all this way through the wasteland?

Hoshiguma:
Even a Vouivre as intrepid as you's gotta have her mealtimes.

Bagpipe:
Mmffm...

Bagpipe:
...so tasty...

Bagpipe:
Er, wait, is this part of the interrogation too?

Hoshiguma:
Part of it? It ended a while ago.

Bagpipe:
I was thinkin' you'd ask me some about me and Chenchen's past, check if I was lyin' or not...

Hoshiguma:
No need.

Hoshiguma:
What I needed to know, I long since knew.

Bagpipe:
You mean...

Bagpipe:
Um, wait, wait. It just came to me. I know you too. You're the L.G.D.'s Hoshi... Hoshi...

Hoshiguma:
Hoshi... hoshi? Ha ha, you'd be better off not calling me that. Especially not in front of them.

Hoshiguma:
How about this, Bagpipe. We'll stick to code, and you stay in this room just a little longer. I'll step out for a moment to see someone.

Swire:
Finished grilling?

Hoshiguma:
Why not go in yourself, curious as you are?

Swire:
Is there anything worth the curiosity?

Swire:
Rhodes Island's people are all on their way. She can't stay here for long.

Hoshiguma:
If I've kept track of the time right, they should be here now.

Swire:
Hmph, that puk gaai Lung. Who knows where she's frolicking about right now while we're left working overtime.

Hoshiguma:
If Ch'en heard her old classmate walked a million miles looking for her, she'd be at least a little ruffled.

Hoshiguma:
She won't say it, but she's always been loyal to her friends, Missy, and you know that.

Swire:
What do her friends matter to me?

Swire:
And you, you absolutely sent a message to Rhodes Island the moment you got the tip-off. Why the effort to interrogate her too? Do you love it, playing the bad cop?

Hoshiguma:
Best to go through proper procedures, what with all the kids on the force watching.

Hoshiguma:
Besides, don't you wanna do a little finding out, see what new dangers old Ch'en might get into?

Swire:
...No thank you.

Swire:
Ugh, I'm so done with this! Once Rhodes Island picks her up from in there, you're giving me a clear, thorough report... No slacking!

Hoshiguma:
Ha ha, alright.

Hoshiguma:
Look, here's the Rhodes Island operator to lead her away—

Bagpipe:
Ehhhhh, what?!

Bagpipe:
So Chenchen's actually left the L.G.D. already? You're telling me I need to go somewhere else now?

Bagpipe:
Er, what was that company called...

Bagpipe:
—Rhooodes—Island?
