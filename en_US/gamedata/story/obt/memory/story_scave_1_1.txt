Scavenger:
Reporting in.

Scavenger:
Day... seven.

Scavenger:
More deceased got disposed of this morning. Likely extreme Originium particulate density in the building. Conditions for the Infected are turning south fast.

Scavenger:
For the past 24 hours, haven't seen any workers in any area not covered by walls, let alone leaving the factory.

Scavenger:
Comms pick up heavy interference when I get even slightly closer.

Scavenger:
High-voltage network all around outside. No way to locate the control room for now.

Scavenger:
Got the exterior patrol shifts and movement patterns down. Can't work out the guards inside yet.

Scavenger:
I want to get this crap over with. If you give the go, I can take the most violent option.

Scavenger:
Hmph... Fine, Rhodes Island does things its own way. Copy.

Scavenger:
Plan B? The factory's waste transporter goes down to the basement every morning at three. They stop running the sewer pipes in the meantime.

Scavenger:
Simple enough to get through, as long as I get a gas mask.

Scavenger:
I'm only responsible for paralyzing the security systems here, anyway. Not my job to provide followup support or guidance, right?

Scavenger:
...I know. I can do this less cleanly, if it comes to it. Figured that's why you called me for this in the first place.

Scavenger:
End of report.

Scavenger:
Insane how Rhodes Island actually wants to save Infected. What an employer.

Scavenger:
That's the sound of the transporter starting up... It's go time.

Factory Guard:
Ugh—

Scavenger:
Lights out, bozo.

Scavenger:
Security system here seems almost as complex as a prison. Whatever, it practically is one anyway.

Scavenger:
Need to find the control room before I tip anyone off—

???:
Watch it!

Scavenger:
Huh?

???:
Any further and you'll trip the automated—

???:
—What? You?

Scavenger:
...Tulio.

Tulio:
'Scavenger'. Heh, didn't think you were still kicking.

Tulio:
What're you doing here? Guessing you've been dragging that weapon with you through the sewer pipes, huh, li'l rat?

Scavenger:
......

Tulio:
—Hold on, lower your blade, let's talk this out. Else I'll sound the alarm.

Tulio:
The system's linked directly to police HQ. They're gonna read any signal from here as an Infected riot.

Scavenger:
You a guard here too?

Tulio:
Yeah, but trust me, Scavenger—

Scavenger:
Tch. Trust you?

Tulio:
I'm betting we're after the same thing. I saw you knock that guy out. You're looking for a way out, aren't you?

Tulio:
'Cause I want out too, or else I wouldn't have stopped you just now.

Scavenger:
Hmph.

Tulio:
*Sigh* I'm serious, I turned a new leaf since all those years ago. Look, I'm Infected now too. I've been through hella shit, I... I understand you.

Tulio:
You've seen this factory up close. You know how things are here, right?

Tulio:
They call me a guard, but I'm still just as much a prisoner as anyone else. We're all just as damned here.

Scavenger:
Okay, but you're their overseer.

Tulio:
You know the sweet lies this place cooks up to lure in the Infected... I don't like it either, but we've all gotta get our hands dirty to survive.

Scavenger:
You don't get any sympathy from me, sorry.

Tulio:
Hold on, I haven't gotten to the important part. I know the systems here inside out. You can't get past them without my help.

Tulio:
There're two watchhound cores monitoring the whole factory at the same time. Throwing the master breaker to cut the surveillance won't get you anywhere either; they'll switch to emergency power, fast.

Tulio:
You need someone to work with you, and obviously I need someone to help me out. So no matter how much you distrust me, working together's still our best bet.

Scavenger:
I never said I was escaping.

Tulio:
I know you're wary of me, but—

Scavenger:
—I'm completing shutting down this place's security system.

Tulio:
What?

Scavenger:
That's the job I took.

Tulio:
What kinda merc just comes out and spills the job they're on?

Scavenger:
Cut the crap. The sooner I'm done, the better. Tell me where the surveillance cores are located.

Tulio:
Alright... so you're agreeing to work together, then? Is that what you mean?

Tulio:
I know what you're planning, Scavenger. I'm not gonna tell you every route straight away.

Tulio:
Follow me, and keep to the foot of the wall. I've figured out the blind spots.

Scavenger:
Is the factory foreman in?

Tulio:
He's not. Why would he be? It's three in the morning.

Tulio:
He only shows up occasionally. What kinda healthy guy would wanna live in a place where the air's filled with Originium?

Scavenger:
So everyone here's Infected?

Tulio:
Yeah. Not a problem for you, right? You're already Infected, what's a couple more rocks gonna do?

Tulio:
What about the rest of your crew? I figure they all got their protection on?

Tulio:
What're you guys after, anyway? There's nothing valuable here, and we don't exactly make high-precision Originium products. Seriously can't figure out why anyone'd rob this place.

Tulio:
...Don't feel like answering, huh? You weren't this hard to talk to back when we used to do business.

Tulio:
Although I guess you wouldn't have cut it as a merc if you were the same as before.

Scavenger:
Don't waste your breath. Never wanted to work with a piece of shit like you, anyway.

Tulio:
Tch...

Tulio:
But we've got no choice for now. We have to split ways from here.

Tulio:
Surveillance core's right over there, through the workshop.

Scavenger:
Then we each make our move in ten minutes. I'll find you after. Once we RDV, we head to the master control room and take out the whole system.

Scavenger:
You better have turned that new goddamn leaf.

Tulio:
Base station signal screener's already off.

Tulio:
Next, high-voltage network... down. Electric doors... open. Pulling the master breaker.

Tulio:
Phew...

Scavenger:
Done?—

Scavenger:
Tch...! Knew it!

Scavenger:
Asshole! Backstabbing me again?!

Scavenger:
How the hell does this work out for you?

Tulio:
Heh. Always gotta try, y'know?

Scavenger:
Think you can get away with this? A little shit like you's never gonna fool me twice!

Tulio:
What else am I supposed to do? Just sit back and wait for you to take me out?

Tulio:
Neither of us needs the other now. The factory doors are wide open. Of course I'm gonna make the first move instead of being the victim.

Scavenger:
I never said I was gonna kill you.

Tulio:
Duh. Why would you? But in what bizarro universe does this end with you letting me the hell go?

Tulio:
I'm Infected too. Now I can understand how desperate you were back then... and also how much you must hate me.

Scavenger:
True... never had that many clients I could put a face to.

Tulio:
Tch. Since when did Zalaks have this much strength?

Scavenger:
I told you, you're not getting away with this.

Scavenger:
Now don't move, unless you wanna get cut in half.

Tulio:
Tch...

Scavenger:
Let's be clear. Whether or not I kill you right now is entirely up to my mood.

Tulio:
You... This goddamn Oripathy's making me so weak. How the hell are you still just fine?

Tulio:
How did you pull this off? You're like a completely different person.

Scavenger:
Hmph. Of course you wish I was still that rookie merc. Pure. Gullible.

Scavenger:
I did the dirty work no one else was willing to, and the client never gave a damn thing in return.

Scavenger:
I blacked out from an Oripathy attack, woke up in a ditch, and you know what I found? The few remaining things I had from home, gone, taken just like that.

Tulio:
You were gonna die sooner or later, so I figured waste not, want not...

Scavenger:
Heh. 'Waste not, want not.'

Tulio:
Everyone living on the edge exploits each other like that. Isn't that the understanding?

Tulio:
And what was I supposed to do? Wait for some Infected to die and cause a spreader event right in front of me?

Tulio:
Who knew you'd live? And still be alive today!

Scavenger:
Right... That's probably because I have someone who hopes I live.

Scavenger:
When I woke up, I still had that silver coin sewn into my clothes. It was still there. That's why I decided to live on.

Tulio:
You really know how to hang onto life, rat. What could one silver buy you?

Scavenger:
I never spent it. Never will.

Tulio:
Then how did you...?

Scavenger:
The same way you got tricked into this factory, thinking there'd be a stable enough life for an Infected here. But what you got instead were vile living conditions and inhumane treatment.

Scavenger:
What I went through didn't stop there. Might've been even worse. But that's life for you.

Tulio:
The hell are you saying to me...? Acting like we're in the same boat.

Scavenger:
We're all in the same goddamn boat.

Tulio:
*Sigh*... Fine, I get it. Bet I look like the punchline of a joke to you now, huh? Must be nice, getting your revenge. No wonder you're in such a good mood.

Scavenger:
Pssh... You think way too much.

Tulio:
Yeah, and it's all your fault I'm in this mess anyway!

Tulio:
Because I hired your Infected mercenary ass, it didn't take long for me to get symptoms too. I should've just stayed away from you and your kind!

Scavenger:
Alright, get this through your skull. Touching the Infected isn't gonna give you Oripathy just like that.

Tulio:
You think I'd believe that?

Scavenger:
No skin off my nose if you don't, but that's my current employer's view. I've gotta tell you on their behalf.

Scavenger:
Oh... Now I get why you wanted me to work with you, even though you were scared of me getting payback.

Scavenger:
You were gonna have me bust you out, then dispose of me to complete this imaginary 'revenge' of yours. Your whole 'waste not, want not.'

Tulio:
Ha, like you weren't thinking the same thing? Weren't you biding your time with me, just so you could make your move now?

Tulio:
So why're we still blabbering? Need me to teach you how they handle the Infected they kill here?

Scavenger:
No. I only cooperated with you so I could finish my mission a little faster.

Scavenger:
I can cope with shitawful work environments, and that includes shitawful coworkers. I don't think the way you do.

Scavenger:
Besides, my mission was to aid and rescue the Infected, and you're one of them.

Tulio:
Rescue the Infected? You're shitting me.

Scavenger:
Whatever. Ask my employer.

Scavenger:
Reporting in.

Scavenger:
Factory security system paralyzed, but foreman not on site.

Scavenger:
Um, I don't care how you guys extract the Infected. Maybe you're taking them somewhere or whatever. I just wanna confirm if my mission's complete or not.

Scavenger:
Factory guards are also Infected. You rescuing them too?

Scavenger:
...So, I can handle problems my own way here.

Scavenger:
Understood. I'll withdraw to the designated site ASAP.

Scavenger:
End of report.

Scavenger:
Hmph. Sounds like they're actually making good on what they said.

Scavenger:
Never imagined I'd find such a trustworthy client. Let alone anyone who takes the Infected seriously.

Scavenger:
...Just like how her wish could never come true.

Scavenger:
—Anyway, you heard that. They gave me some leeway.

Tulio:
Damn, you really don't care about anything except what your employer wants.

Scavenger:
Think what you like. I'll toss a coin to decide your fate, then.

Scavenger:
If it's tails, I clean up the trash here and now; if it's heads, I let you off, and give you one more chance to start over, like the other Infected.
