Merry:
*Pant*... *pant*...

Merry:
Faster... I've got to get faster.

Merry:
Whoa—

Merry:
*Cough*, *cough* *cough*... Ouch...

Merry:
Ah, shoot! My snowboard... Looks like it's still good. Okay, please, hang in there a little longer. There's a car rental place just down the hill... As long as I make it there...

Merry:
I... I must hurry... or I won't make it...!

Merry:
Adnachiel... Steward... hang on just a little longer...!

Merry:
Pardon me! Is there anyone here?!

Merry:
I need a car! Is there anyone—

Transport Rental Salesman:
Fotze! Do you know what time it is?! Who's knocking!

Merry:
Ugh, my forehead—

Transport Rental Salesman:
Little girl...? Are you okay?

Merry:
I-I'm okay... You rent cars, right? I'm sorry for disrupting your sleep, but I need a car that can make it to the city right away!

Transport Rental Salesman:
It's five in the morning... What's the rush? It takes three to four hours to make it to the city from here.

Merry:
*Cough*... I... I have to leave right now. It's an emergency! Please, sir, give me a car right now! I really, really, really—

Transport Rental Salesman:
Verdammt, what's so important you can't let me sleep?

Merry:
M-My friends' lives are in danger. I need to find a doctor in the city.

Merry:
They got in an accident in the mountain range to the north. They only got some simple treatment at the settlement there... I need to find a better medical organization to treat them right away!

Transport Rental Salesman:
You mean you came all the way here from the north?

Transport Rental Salesman:
You crossed the mountain range overnight? And the snowstorm hasn't even let up...

Merry:
I didn't have another choice. *Cough*... They are heavily injured and can't move. The settlement doesn't have the proper medical equipment or medicine either...

Transport Rental Salesman:
Did they trip or get frostbite? You could've just waited for the rescue team. Why did you have to cross the mountains yourself?

Merry:
No, normal EMTs won't do it... and we need medicine that can treat them...!

Transport Rental Salesman:
You aren't even explaining yourself clearly. How am I supposed to rent you a car right now?

Merry:
Please, sir, I can't lose my friends... As long as there's still a bit of hope, I have to go to the city to find a doctor that can treat them! *Cough*... *Cough*...

Transport Rental Salesman:
*Sigh*... Must have been a long journey for you.

Merry:
I-I'm fine...

Transport Rental Salesman:
Okay, fine. This is their lives we're talking about. Come with me. Let me say one thing, though. Don't be too optimistic, girl. You won't necessarily find yourself a doctor out in the city.

Transport Rental Salesman:
The doctors there, with the kind of salary they get, won't risk heading into the snowstorm to treat somebody.

Merry:
I was on the Bobsled Patrol Team back home. If you get me a car, I will find a doctor! I have some savings too. I can give the doctor everything as long as my friends get to live—

Merry:
There has to be a doctor who's nice enough to come treat them. I will find them and beg them to come if I have to. I need to get my friends treated.

Transport Rental Salesman:
Hmph... You're a loyal one.

Transport Rental Salesman:
I hope you find your doctor. Okay, here's the car. It's by the day. Do you have the deposit and documents?

Merry:
Sorry, mister, I didn't expect this to happen, so I didn't bring much money. Is this enough for the deposit?

Merry:
If it's not enough, I... I have this necklace. It was a special birthday present. It should be worth some money...! Yeah, uh, and I... let's see...

Transport Rental Salesman:
It's all good. Keep your stinking necklace. Take the car. When you come back, I better see it in one piece.

Merry:
......!

Merry:
Thank you, sir! I will be back on time! K-Keep my snowboard as collateral. Once I find a doctor, I'll come back before we head up the mountain!

Transport Rental Salesman:
*Sigh*... I don't know if this girl's simple or just reckless.

Transport Rental Salesman:
Look at the shape the snowboard's in. That's hardly worth anything.

Transport Rental Salesman:
Whatever. It's obvious she's trying to save somebody... Let's just call this doing a good deed.

Transport Rental Salesman:
But still...

Transport Rental Salesman:
Hfff, it's so cold today, and it's pitch black outside. She even came straight here through the most dangerous mountain range there is... How did she do it?

Transport Rental Salesman:
Just what is going on with her friends that she has to go all the way to the city to find a doctor? If they're hurt or got frostbite, there are much better ways to go about it.

Transport Rental Salesman:
It can't be something dangerous like Oripathy, right...?

Transport Rental Salesman:
Hah, that'd be a waste of time. No one would help someone who's bound to die in this kind of shitty weather.

Merry:
(Okay, time to go.)

Merry:
(The snowstorm's gotten stronger, but this is nothing. This won't stop me!)

Merry:
(I gotta do it...)

Merry:
......

Merry:
I... I didn't tell the truth.

Merry:
If I'd told him Adnachiel and Steward got infected with Oripathy, he wouldn't have let me borrow his car... He would've chased me away.

Merry:
But... I have to go. I'm so sorry, mister, but I'll come back to return the car for sure—No, I'll give you a new car. I'll work hard and pay you ten times the money back if I need to!

Merry:
I will come back to apologize...

Merry:
But now...

Merry:
Adnachiel, Steward, just hold on a little longer. I'll be at the city by sunrise.

Merry:
I will bring a doctor who can treat Oripathy and medicine back... I promise.

Merry:
I promise.

Adnachiel:
Merry... Have you made it to the city yet?

Merry:
*Pant*... You... you're awake...

Adnachiel:
Are you alright...?!

Merry:
I'm... okay... Adnachiel, Steward, you... *cough*... Wait for me to come back. I'll find a doctor right away...!

Adnachiel:
It's nearly impossible to find anyone who's infected in this city. You'll have to try a company or medical organization that does research in Oripathy.

Merry:
I-I'll look it up... That's strange. How come there's so little information on this city?

Merry:
There's no hospitals here that accept Oripathy patients...? Only a few pharmaceutical companies in the outskirts?!

Adnachiel:
That's nothing strange... Leithanian cities don't really need that many medical organizations that deal in Oripathy.

Adnachiel:
Oripathy is an incurable disease, and anyone who's so unlucky to be infected here has no choice but to spend a king's ransom on medication to slow down the spread of the disease.

Steward:
Merry, you can't afford that medicine, and it's not something you should worry about either.

Steward:
If you find anyone who can take care of us, just tell us how to contact them. After that...

Adnachiel:
Yeah... You don't need to come back.

Adnachiel:
Thanks for dragging us all the way to the settlement. We got first aid... and that's more than enough.

Steward:
*Cough*... Adnachiel and I will figure out how to survive. Thanks for leaving us the comms, but let's put an end to this, Merry.

Merry:
What... What are you two talking about?!

Merry:
I'm looking for a doctor to come treat you two right now. Just hold on! I'll be back with a doctor soon!

Merry:
Adnachiel, Steward, wait for me. Don't just leave... and protect yourselves. Don't let your wounds get any worse.

Adnachiel:
But...

Merry:
No buts! You hear me?!

Adnachiel:
Yeah... I hear you loud and clear.

Merry:
That's not enough! Promise me you won't leave me! I can do it! I will save you two!

Steward:
Merry, thanks for looking after us, but we can't drag you into this mess...

Merry:
We're friends! Friends are supposed to help each other out! And given the circumstances, your lives are more important to me than anything!

Merry:
Dammit! I don't want to get mad at you right now, but I will make you two pay for what you just said! Wait for my next call. I'll have some good news!

Merry:
Hah... Those idiots. How dare they try to leave me all by myself... Where can they go anyway?! I better find them waiting for me!

Merry:
I'll head to the aid station first. I trucked my way here all night. What's two more kilometers...? Right, I've got to call the hospital too...

*Dialing sounds*

Regular Hospital Worker:
You've reached the emergency room hotline. How may I help you?

Merry:
Oh, hello, I have two friends who were injured in the snowstorm out in the countryside. They need medical attention right now...

Regular Hospital Worker:
Okay, just a moment...

Regular Hospital Worker:
I'm very sorry, but we have to wait until the storm lets up before we can send an ambulance. Can you describe to me how they were injured?

Merry:
They got hurt in the mountains. One of them is really hurt in the abdomen and leg areas... Also, they have Oripathy, so they will need Oripathy medication...

Regular Hospital Worker:
Did you say Oripathy...?

Merry:
Yeah, they...

Regular Hospital Worker:
Sorry, but our hospital does not accept Oripathy patients. Thank you for your call. I wish you a pleasant day.

Merry:
Hello? Hello??

Merry:
They hung up...? Why did they hang up? Didn't their website say they treat Oripathy?! Dammit, are there any medical companies here that treat Oripathy...?

*Dialing sounds*

Medical Company Staff:
Hello. How may I help you?

Merry:
Hello, is this Leithanien Woche Pharmaceuticals? M-My name is Merry. My friends are infected with Oripathy, and they need treatment right now...

Medical Company Staff:
May I have your name? And where do you live?

Merry:
U-Uh... my name? I'm from the north...

Medical Company Staff:
You're not a local...? What about the patients?

Merry:
M-My friends are from Laterano and Kjerag. They came to Leithanien during their travels. I left them at a settlement in the mountains outside the city...

Merry:
Hello...? Hello? Dammit! Why did they hang up?

Merry:
Is Oripathy really so scary that you can't get treatment if you're not a local or noble?

Merry:
*Sobs*... I-I'll try another one...

Merry:
Hello, my friends are infected with Oripathy and need treatment. They are seriously hurt...

Merry:
Huh...? Them? They are normal travelers, but we won't fall behind on the fees for their treatment and medicine. I promise! I-I can even pay extra—

Merry:
If you can send a doctor to come with me right now—

Merry:
A doctor...! Is there a doctor who can treat Oripathy patients? This isn't a prank! I've got sick friends...

......

Merry:
Why...? How come there isn't a single medical organization that's willing to help? Adnachiel, Steward... They're both sick. They need treatment!

Merry:
Why do they have to ask, 'Which family are the patients from?' Are common folks not allowed to get treatment?

Merry:
I already told them we can pay up, but they still wouldn't take us... Why...?

Merry:
Is it because they have Oripathy? Isn't that just a kind of disease? They got sick, that's all. They didn't want to be infected...

Merry:
Why doesn't anyone want to help now that they are Infected?

Merry:
No... I can't give up yet... There are still three more... There has to be someone willing to help!

Steward:
Merry? Can you hear me...? Are you still mad?

Steward:
Listen to me. This is not something that the three of us can change.

Steward:
Adnachiel's fever has gone down a little. He's getting some good sleep now. We need to cool our heads and figure out where we go from here.

Steward:
We don't know if Oripathy is infectious under these circumstances.

Steward:
This is a very dangerous disease... and you may get caught in the mess. If there really is no way, don't come back for us.

Steward:
Also...

Steward:
If... If you can't find a doctor who's willing to come, we understand.

Steward:
The mountains are too dangerous during a snowstorm. Doctors are people too, and the medical organizations need to be responsible to their doctors, Merry. We can't blame them.

Steward:
We're very grateful, Merry. Adnachiel and I know how you feel, and you are our friend. But because you're our friend, we don't want anything to happen to you.

Steward:
Stop acting so tough, and don't put your future on the line. Stay in the city until it's safe.

Steward:
Give us a call once you get this, Merry.

Merry:
No, I don't want to hear any of that...

Merry:
I know. Of course I know, but... but I...

Merry:
T-There's two left... They only have five employees, but...

Merry:
Guh... I'm going for it!

Merry:
Hello! Is this the liaison office of... uh... 'Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals?'

Medic Operator:
Uh... Yes! May I help you?

Merry:
Um... My name is Merry. I'm from northern Leithanien... I-I guess I'm kind of a noble? I've got a pretty big family, and our neighbors love us.

Merry:
I didn't bring my passbook with me, but I have this much in the bank... I-I can even work. I definitely won't owe any money for the medical fees!

Medic Operator:
Hmm...? Um... Excuse me...?

Merry:
*Cough*... *Whimpers*, I'm sorry! I'm sorry I lied! I'm not a noble, and I don't have anywhere close to this much in the bank, but I will really work to pay for the treatment!

Merry:
I have two friends with Oripathy. Please don't turn them down just because they are foreigners. They are heavily injured, and their lives are in danger. I really need someone to help them...!

Medic Operator:
Heavily injured Infected? Where are they?

Merry:
At a settlement in the mountains. I left them there for the time being.

Merry:
Please! Please come with me. It may be a little dangerous to travel there, but I promise! I promise I will keep the doctors safe even if I have to protect them with my life!

Merry:
I'll do something about the medical fees too! Please just help them first...

Merry:
Please, I beg you... Help my friends...

Medic Operator:
...

Medic Operator:
You don't have to say that. Don't... swear on your life.

Medic Operator:
It's Rhodes Island's mission to help the Infected, Miss Merry.

Medic Operator:
We will go with you. Could you tell us how the Infected are doing?

Merry:
Y-You will...?

Medic Operator:
Yes, we'll leave right away. Are they still in the early stages of their infection? If they are, then we mustn't wait. That's the best time to treat Oripathy.

Merry:
I have their coordinates. I'll send them to you right away!

Merry:
Oh, but... There's a snowstorm out in the countryside right now... We need to be prepared...

Medic Operator:
Relax. Rhodes Island has transport suitable for all kinds of weather, and also have experienced operators who can guarantee our safety during the trip. We'll make it there even in the harshest weather and most dangerous places.

Merry:
Really?! That's so nice... I-Is this real?

Merry:
I mean... I'm not too cold, am I? I-I can't feel my legs... Am I dreaming...?

Medic Operator:
*Sigh*... Looks like you need treatment yourself. Miss Merry, can you reach the patients right now?

Merry:
It's not a dream... It's not a dream!

Merry:
I'll give them a call right now!

Merry:
Hey, Adnachiel, Steward, can you hear me?! Stay right where you are! Rhodes Island and I are coming to help you right now... I've found them...

Merry:
I mean... I've really found a way to help my friends...!

Rhodes Island Operator:
All preparations complete. Rhodes Island Critical Response Team is ready for deployment.

Medic Operator:
Miss Merry, are you okay?

Merry:
Uhh... I'm fine... I'll lead the way...

Medic Operator:
Oh, don't move... You're very weak... You must've spent way too much time on the road.

Medic Operator:
We'll head to the coordinates' right now, but it'll take us seven to eight hours, even if the weather gets better.

Merry:
Uhh... No way... It only took me five hours to get here...

Medic Operator:
Five hours?!

Medic Operator:
That was way too reckless! You... *Sigh*...

Merry:
I need to return the car... to the rental shop... Sir... I'm sorry... Thanks...

Merry:
Then... Adnach... Stew...

Medic Operator:
She's starting to blabber nonsense...

Medic Operator:
Get some rest, Miss Merry. You've done really well.

Merry:
Zzz... zzz...

Rhodes Island Operator:
I'll drive. The patients are waiting, and we need to head there ASAP. Is she sitting on the passenger side?

Medic Operator:
No, I need to take her in the med vehicle and treat her there.

Medic Operator:
She's got frostbite, multiple scrapes, and sprained joints. From the looks of it... she might even have a few broken bones. It's a miracle she held on for so long.

Medic Operator:
Five hours... That's way too reckless. How could she have made her way down such a treacherous path during a snowstorm...?

Rhodes Island Operator:
She's tough. If she managed to come all the way here that fast, she might just be the kind of operator we need.

Rhodes Island Operator:
And I heard her mumbling. She said she wanted to save her friends, right? That's some temperament she's got.

Medic Operator:
It's rash! She's just lucky, and she may not be as lucky next time! Seriously, if she was one of ours, the instructors would definitely be tearing her a new one.

Medic Operator:
But fine... It's too early to talk about all this. Our top priority right now is to rescue her friends. As for Miss Merry herself...

Medic Operator:
We'll have them walk us through everything she and her friends have been through after they all make it out safe.
