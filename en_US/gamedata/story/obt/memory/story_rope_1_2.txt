Perfumer:
I'm so very sorry, I was preparing the soil for some plants just now, and didn't notice I had a guest, and for a moment I overreacted...

Perfumer:
How shameful of me.

Rope:
Uh, no biggie. Don't mind it. I shouldn't have come in without permission.

Perfumer:
Oh, not at all. All my Rhodes Island friends are free to enter as they wish. There's no problem with that.

Perfumer:
But really, Miss Rope, you could've just called for me if you were here.

Rope:
Oh, I kinda called my lungs out. You didn't answer...

Rope:
Whatever. As long as there's no danger, that's good.

Perfumer:
Danger?

Rope:
Nopety-nope, nothing. Don't mind it.

Perfumer:
Hmm... In any case, thank you for your concern~

Perfumer:
However, there wouldn't be any danger in the Convalescent Garden, you know. After all, this is a place for guests to unwind in. Safety is guaranteed.

Rope:
I guess, with all the security systems outside the cabin. No-one from outside Rhodes'd ever get in.

Perfumer:
Exactly~

Perfumer:
Speaking of which, when did you come in, Miss Rope? It's strange, there ought to be a bell in front of the door.

Rope:
Bell? Oh, you mean the device thing hidden in the entranceway? I'm guessing if you touch it, it sounds a little ringy thing?

Perfumer:
Right, that's the one. I've always treated it as a visitors' bell.

Perfumer:
Since there were times I was so busy I wouldn't notice any guests, Closure installed the bell for me. As long as the door sounds that bell, it'll notify me even when I'm working.

Rope:
I gotcha.

Rope:
Heheh~ You meant that thing, huh. I jumped straight over it.

Perfumer:
Eh? Jumped...?

Rope:
Uh-huh. Of course I'm not gonna randomly step on stuff if I don't know where it came from! Walk without a sound, climb without a trace. That's essential survival skills.

Perfumer:
Closure spent an hour hiding that device properly. She said nobody would ever notice it!

Perfumer:
You really are something, Rope!

Rope:
Aw, shucks, heckie darn. This stuff's my field of expertise~

Rope:
Oh, wait, Miss Perfumer, on your face!

Perfumer:
Eh?

Rope:
There's some mud stuck to it... uh, here, here.

Perfumer:
Ah, er, on my face?

Perfumer:
Hereabouts...?

Rope:
Uh, forget it. Just lemme.

Rope:
Alrighty, wiped that for you.

Perfumer:
Oh, thank you!

Perfumer:
Hm?

Perfumer:
(Oh, this is a different aroma. It's...)

Rope:
What's up?

Perfumer:
Ah, nothing, not in particular. Thank you.

Perfumer:
(Hm...)

Perfumer:
(Should be no problem if it was just a little, right?)

Perfumer:
Oh, right, Rope, what did you need me for?

Perfumer:
It's very unusual to see you around here. Ah, could it be you have a new interest in perfumery? If so, you're always welcome here~

Rope:
No, that's not quite it.

Perfumer:
Oh, then what?

Rope:
Uh.

Rope:
It-It was the Doctor! Yeah, right, the Doctor!

Rope:
The Doctor begged me to get some aromatherapy stuff from here. The, uh, the regular stuff, to help with sleeping.

Perfumer:
Ah, is the Doctor having trouble falling asleep again?

Rope:
I guess? Seemed a little out of it on missions the past two days.

Rope:
Still forced it to support the team, too... (Muttering)

Perfumer:
Hmm? Did you say something just now?

Rope:
Nothing! You heard wrong!

Perfumer:
?

Perfumer:
Hmm... I see, then. Alright.

Perfumer:
You want the Doctor's usual, the lavender scents, right? Of course.

Perfumer:
If you're not pressed for time, Rope, could you wait while I finish sorting out these cultivation soils before I get the aromas for you? My hands are all muddy right now; it'd be a little hard.

Perfumer:
You can stroll about in the greenhouse for now. I'll be all done in just a moment!

Rope:
Of course, no problem~ Strolling here'd be my pleasure!

Perfumer:
(Stirring)

Rope:
Hey, this flower's pretty cute. All tiny and... woah woah woah why's it so big now?

Perfumer:
(Stirring) (Stirring)

Rope:
Whew, I felt my heart stop here.

Rope:
Even a flower gets to be all dangerous. Wh—Who knew greenhouses went so deep?

Perfumer:
(Stirring) (Holding in laughter) (Stirring)

Rope:
Hm? Is this... spice? Whoa, it smells great too, nm, mm?

Rope:
Ha, ha, ha—choo!

Perfumer:
Pfft.

Rope:
Eh?

Perfumer:
*cough* *cough* *cough*.

Rope:
Hachoo, hachoo. Hic. Whoof...

Perfumer:
Are you okay?

Rope:
I'm... I'm great. Hachoo.

Perfumer:
Don't exert yourself. Those flowers and spices are all ingredients I use in my perfumery, and their scents likely aren't as nice as any end-product form. They can be a little stronger...

Rope:
Try a lot stronger! Ha, hachoo!

Rope:
Feels like my nose could just fall off... You deal with this stuff everyday? And you make it smell so good somehow. I'm beginning to admire you now...

Perfumer:
Now that's just exaggerating. Oh, right, on the long table over there is a small green bottle. If your nose feels uncomfortable, you can give that a small sniff. It should be much better after that.

Rope:
Oh—! Thank you!

Rope:
Lemme see, green, green... hachoo! There it is!

Rope:
Ah, this smells sooo so good.

Perfumer:
I'm glad you like it. Do you feel a little better?

Rope:
Ah.

Rope:
Wow. I'm not sneezing anymore.

Rope:
This thing does work! Real work!

Perfumer:
My, my. Did you perhaps doubt the power of aromatherapy? That it was just placebo effect? That they were excessive hobby goods?

Rope:
Uh.

Rope:
It's... it's not like I ever thought that.

Perfumer:
No need to be nervous. I don't mind at all.

Perfumer:
Any amount of people will have misconceptions when they first come into contact with perfumery and aromatherapy. After all, it's a field you've never learned about. It's very normal you'd think that, Rope.

Perfumer:
It's something I have to strive hard for—how to give people a true approach to perfumery. The willingness to approach it.

Rope:
Huh. How do I put it...

Rope:
I might not get perfuming all that much, but I still know your work's real important, Perfumer.

Rope:
After all, the Doctor—heck, and even Dr. Kal'tsit—if they're both saying it's good, then it's gotta be, right?

Perfumer:
Eh? The Doctor and Dr. Kal'tsit both...?

Rope:
Yeah. I've heard them mention it a whole lotta times.

Rope:
'Lena's aromatherapy stands dominant at the forefront of the treatment and rehabilitation domain.' ...In words kinda like that.

Rope:
And you gotta admit, there's a lotta operators who love scrambling for this place, right? I hear there's even people who just sleep in the greenhouse and don't wanna leave?

Perfumer:
There are a few...

Perfumer:
I recently added a few more beds just because of that, but free space is still a concern as ever.

Perfumer:
If things keep going on like this, I might need to ask Dr. Kal'tsit to see if the greenhouse can't be enlarged a little.

Rope:
You see? You got it.

Rope:
It's pretty awesome, isn't it? You already got a bunchload of people who know the deal with perfumery.

Rope:
I mean, I might not super understand it, but there's way too much I don't understand. Just 'cause I don't get something myself doesn't mean I have to say it's pointless, right?

Perfumer:
......

Perfumer:
Heheh.

Rope:
Whoa, what's the funnies now?

Rope:
Perfumer?

Perfumer:
Heheh. I'm sorry. Mm. I'm just a little happy.

Rope:
??

Perfumer:
Don't you mind, Rope. In fact, if you don't mind, you can just call me Lena.

Rope:
Uh, ah, tha-...

Perfumer:
And then how about I call you Ropie?

Rope:
Huh?

Rope:
Sure, of course, sure...

Perfumer:
Heheh. Then that's settled.

Rope:
(Wo-wo-wo-woah, what's going on?)

Rope:
(Was Perfumer always so casual?)

Rope:
Um, um.

Rope:
Say, Perfumer...

Perfumer:
Hm?

Rope:
Uh, L-Lena.

Perfumer:
Mhmm. What is it?

Rope:
Has anyone ever told you... you're, like, really surprisingly intense.

Perfumer:
Never, no.

Rope:
You're kidding.

Rope:
Whatever. It works...

Perfumer:
Alright. That should be the cultivation soils sorted, now.

Perfumer:
I'll go wash my hands.

Rope:
You're done already? Huh, I can't really tell how this soil's different from before.

Perfumer:
This one's a soil for raising flowers. The proportions of what went into it might be a little special.

Rope:
For flowers?

Perfumer:
Indeed. Gloria's therapy is into a new phase. It requires some very particular flora, with astonishingly stringent requirements for their soil.

Rope:
Huh.

Perfumer:
Truthfully, I haven't been too successful the past few times I've tried to cultivate them. I wanted to try new ratios this time, and see whether there's any issues with the soil's proportions or nutrients...

Rope:
Ooh!

Perfumer:
If nutrition is the problem, then I can sort that, but some plants require things far, far beyond nutrition alone to grow, and that's where things can get a little gnarled.

Perfumer:
I hope it can work this time. If I may say, this time I'm actually quite confident.

Rope:
Sounds hecka complicated. I thought perfumery stuff would be more, uh, more sorta elegant vibes?

Rope:
Y'know, like, only for rich daughters who smell nice all over, all pretty and graceful, who kinda seem like they never had to do work before.

Perfumer:
Ah. Are you complimenting me, Ropie?

Rope:
Mm... take it that way if you want?

Perfumer:
Thank you~ But I'm no leisurely unworking rich girl, you know.

Rope:
That's, uh, I knew that from the moment I saw you with mud stuck to your face.

Perfumer:
Haha, don't tease me now.

Perfumer:
Hmm. The Doctor's usual scent, let me look...

Perfumer:
I remember putting it here. Lavender, lavender... ah, there it is.

Rope:
Right, right! Yeah, little bottles just like that!

Perfumer:
Here, take it.

Perfumer:
This one's very popular. A lot of operators use a little just before bed. Makes falling asleep easier.

Rope:
Ooh~ See, my experience tells me, with packaging this nice and results that good, this probably sells for a ton, right?

Perfumer:
It won't be expensive at all. These are internal, non-marketed. Only Rhodes Islanders get to use it, for now.

Perfumer:
Now then, perhaps you'd like to give it a try too, Ropie?

Rope:
Huh? Try what?

Perfumer:
Aromatherapy, of course. Aromatherapy oils diluted like this are easy to carry, and are sure to alleviate your mind! You can use them anytime, anywhere. It might become a new trend, even!

Perfumer:
My dear Rope, they fit beautiful young women like you perfectly! Let me recommend you these scents...

Rope:
Stooop, stopstopstopstop!

Rope:
What are you doing taking all these bottles out!? H-Hold on!

Rope:
Lena?!

Perfumer:
Oh, Ropie, what are you shrinking back for? And why the hook, too?

Perfumer:
I'm just giving you some recommendations, nothing more. I'm not going to eat you, now~

Rope:
Eep—I dunno, I kinda sense danger here...!

Perfumer:
You're overthinking it.

Rope:
...Am I?

Perfumer:
You are.

Rope:
Something tells me Im not! Uwaagh!

Rope:
*Pant*, *pant*.

Perfumer:
Wonderful. Sure enough, you fit with fragrances perfectly, Ropie.

Rope:
Fit, my patootie!

Rope:
My body leaving a scent's real bad... in a whole lotta ways, it's real bad!

Perfumer:
Is that so?

Perfumer:
If you absolutely can't stand it, of course I won't force you.

Perfumer:
But it really does fit you, you know...

Rope:
......

Rope:
Auuughhh fine I get it!

Rope:
I'll use 'em! I'll use 'em, okay!

Perfumer:
!

Rope:
How'd things turn out like this... ugh.

Rope:
Alright, alright. Okay, I'm gonna go take the Doctor's aroma stuff now.

Rope:
Oh yeah.

Rope:
Almost forgot.

Rope:
You might be carrying some seeds on you. Put 'em away and don't lose 'em again.

Perfumer:
Oh?

Perfumer:
You're giving these back to me now? That was faster than I'd imagined. I thought it'd be at least two more days...

Rope:
Eh? Hold on, what are you saying? Hold up.

Rope:
Are you serious? Ugh. Don't tell me you knew I took—

Perfumer:
Heheh. My nose is very sensitive, you know. The slightest change in the aroma of any little spot, I can tell.

Rope:
Wuh.

Rope:
I'm—I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!!

Rope:
It's just, uh, this bad habit I have kinda... nnneugh.

Perfumer:
Haha, no need to be like that. I'm not blaming you at all.

Rope:
Huh?

Perfumer:
Hmm... truthfully, I was planning to be a little more prepared.

Rope:
Eh? Prepared?

Rope:
Prepared what? The police? Are you turning me in so the cops can arrest me oh god oh god no no no no—

Perfumer:
Whaa-?! Rope?!

Perfumer:
Calm down, just calm down, I won't turn you in, nobody's going to arrest you!

Rope:
R-R-R-Really?

Perfumer:
Really really.

Rope:
Whaahhhhh oh my god Lena you're the nicest person ever—

Perfumer:
For not shedding a single tear, you've been crying an awful long time, Ropie.

Rope:
Eheh. Caught in the act.

Rope:
Let's not mention the past, y'know! You were saying you had something prepared, Lena? What prepared?

Perfumer:
Ah, well.

Perfumer:
What you took with you was a packet of flower seed.

Rope:
Flower... seeds?

Perfumer:
Quite right. I was planning to prepare some suitable soil for them.

Rope:
Is this kinda flower seed really expensive?

Perfumer:
Not at all, now.

Rope:
Then it's really rare?

Perfumer:
I wouldn't say it's anything unusual.

Perfumer:
They're common and quite ordinary. But grow them carefully, and they'll be gorgeous when they bloom. Very suited to perfumery, too.

Perfumer:
You see, no matter what sort of seed, they all return to the soil in the end, and then they'll all flower beautifully.

Rope:
......

Perfumer:
Originally, my thought was that when you came to give these seeds back, I'd encourage you to plant them for yourself.

Rope:
You wanted me to? Myself...?

Perfumer:
That's right. And then once they grew flowers, maybe I'd make an aromatic for you using them~

Rope:
Eh? For me? Making aroma stuff?

Rope:
But, uh, why?

Perfumer:
Do you absolutely want a reason? Hmm... let me think.

Perfumer:
I think it might be—because I always felt you'd be well suited to aromatics, Ropie.

Rope:
Hm~, hm-hmm~, hm-hm-hmm~

Rope:
Morning dew, peppermint, shaved ice showers♪

Rope:
Yo, Doctor. Still sorting out battle reports?

Rope:
Big thanks on the last mission. I thought my number was seriously up this time. Didn't think you had a plan for it forever.

Rope:
But no-one's saying you have to come with the support team, right? That's gotta be a little too dicey.

Rope:
Cool. When things seriously hit the floor, I'll grab you and we'll bug out together.

Rope:
Oh, yeah. Take this. This is the kind of aroma stuff you use, right?

Rope:
This, uh... Perfumer—I mean, Lena wanted me to hand this to you!

Rope:
Heheh, you can tell? Is it obvious?

Rope:
Good things do that to you~

Rope:
Lemme tell you a secret. There's some flowers I planted myself, and they're gonna bloom real soon.
