Babel Interior, Rim Billiton PLC Branch Office at Babel

Amiya:
Savage, are you busy...?

Savage:
Huh? Amiya, you're early here today.

Savage:
There's no goods that need delivering today, and I've got nothing too urgent to deal with.

Savage:
What's the matter, Amiya? Nothing on your plate today either?

Amiya:
Today, the Doctor, Kal'tsit, and Theresa went outside, and they wanted me to stay by myself in my room for now... and then they'd all come back at dinner.

Amiya:
But I don't know what I should even do, alone in my room...

Savage:
Hmmm—hm, so you decided to sneak out and look for me?

Amiya:
Hehe...

Savage:
*Sigh*. That's just how adults are, always tormented by work they can't finish. Not to mention those three make everyone wonder how much of a tireless 'workaholic' someone can be...

Amiya:
Does everyone become like that after they grow up?

Savage:
Not really... some people are forced to be, but there are actual people who believe, from the bottom of their hearts, how diving all the way into work enriches their life.

Amiya:
What kind are you, then, Miss Savage?

Savage:
Me, eh...? When I'm working, I do my part properly until I'm done. I guess I decently like it?

Savage:
But I can relax right now, so of course it'd be even more fun to be with you!

Savage:
That's right, Amiya, why don't we take advantage of today to try and cook something?

Amiya:
Cook?

Savage:
You can learn to make your most favorite Rim Billiton foods, like... carrot pie! Don't you wanna see what it's like to make it?

Savage:
Cooking and baking are the greatest pick-me-ups for loads of people, and you'd be hard-pressed to tear them from it.

Amiya:
I get to make carrot pie with Savage...

Amiya:
Mmhm, I want to make some!

Savage:
Alright, then, let's make some together.

Savage:
The Doctor mentioned loving it too when we tried some together, so let's make a pie for when the Doctor comes back, and all three of us can enjoy it.

Amiya:
That's wonderful...

Savage:
Good! We're settled, then.

Savage:
Follow me, Amiya. The carrots I asked from a work friend are in the kitchen freezer, plus we've got cheese, and the fowl eggs should be in...

Amiya:
Miss Savage, I cracked the fowl eggs!

Savage:
That quick? Lemme see...

Savage:
Er.

Savage:
(How'd half the egg whites go missing...? And all the shells are broken in there, too...)

Savage:
Um, not... not too shabby. Let me just process it a bit more, and we can put them right in...

Amiya:
D—Did I do bad...?

Savage:
Wh-What do you mean? Haha. This is your first time cooking, Amiya. You're just not that used to it.

Savage:
Right, Amiya, could you wash the carrots for me? Mm-hm, the ones right there in the basket...

Savage:
Aaah, you don't need to wash that many! Good, just like that...

Savage:
Hold on, you don't need your fingernails for carrots, you can just use a vegetable peeler... it's normal for them to be all bumpy. First time, after all.

Savage:
It's a bit hard, kneading dough. Just leave that to me...

Savage:
No, let me set the oven, yeah? That's a little much to ask for now...

Savage:
Wait, Amiya, that's not how you clean up flour—

Amiya:
*cough* *cough*... *cough*... Waah, Savage, help me...

Savage:
Pff... pff, haha...

Amiya:
Waaah, my eyes hurt...

Savage:
Sorry, sorry, let me wipe them off for you now... *cough*, kfah-*cough*, kah-haha...

Amiya:
Stop making fun of me!

Savage:
I'm not making fun of you! Pff... You're just being extra adorable right now, that's all, Amiya. Oh, man, I want a memento of this to keep forever.

Savage:
But you've got the flour all over you, now. Let's take you to tidy up first, yeah...

Amiya:
N-No, the pie's most important right now... it'll be awful if we can't finish it in time!

Amiya:
Savage, let's wait until we're done to tidy!

Savage:
Haha, alright then. Amiya, come here, let me wipe your face off for you.

Savage:
Once we've got the pie done and in the oven, we'll go and have a good wash...

Savage:
Phew. Not too bad, and not a moment to lose.

Savage:
Look, three pies, baked in the nick of time.

Amiya:
Mmhm, they smell so good...

Savage:
Now we just need to sprinkle a little sugar on top and keep them warm, and that's a job very well done for us.

Savage:
Come to mention it... I remember the Doctor was fond of particular tastes when it came to food. Amiya, do you have any idea?

Amiya:
Mmhm! I remember all the things the Doctor likes about food. And... I remember about all the food you like too, Savage.

Savage:
What's this, what's this? You've been remembering things about me this whole time?

Amiya:
Hehe... because you've been so nice looking after me, and when I see you eating something you really like, I get really happy too.

Amiya:
I want to remember about everything that makes you happy!

Amiya:
And also, I want to keep making all kinds of really nice food with you!

Amiya:
So, it... it'd be nice if we could stay together forever... just like the Doctor, I hope I can have fun with Savage forever...

Savage:
Amiya...

Amiya:
B-But, if you have work to do, then you should do it! I know work is very important...

Savage:
I'll be with you.

Amiya:
Really?

Savage:
Really. It's okay, Amiya, we're already super, super good friends.

Savage:
Cautus sisters should love each other and live together, helping each all the way. So...

Amiya:
But... Dr. Kal'tsit said, before long, Babel and Rim Billiton PLC are going to finish their cooperative project, and then Savage would...

Savage:
You already know, huh?

Savage:
Yes, it's true. After that, I'll probably be heading back to work in Rim Billiton for a while.

Savage:
I'm already an adult, so there are responsibilities I have to bear. Right now, Rim Billiton still has some things I need to finish.

Savage:
But I'll come back to see you as soon as possible, Amiya. No matter how far apart we are, we're friends. So long as you need me to help, your big sis Savage'll come protect you.

Amiya:
Mmhm... I know.

Savage:
Right. Right, then, let's drop this subject. Who knows if Rim Billiton'll forget about me, and they won't call me back in, and I'll be stuck as an unemployed drifter...

Savage:
Maybe, if you keep at your studies, Amiya, you'll be like a VIP in future, and you'll start your own big company, and then I'll be one of your employees, yeah?

Amiya:
Whuh? My own company...? Um, could I do that...?

Savage:
Start putting in the effort now, and you'll get the chance one day, guaranteed.

Savage:
The Doctor, Kal'tsit, Theresa, they're all especially mighty people. Make sure you learn well from your teachers, Amiya.

Amiya:
Mmhm, I know. You're very mighty too, Savage. When you were in Rim Billiton—

Savage:
No way, no way, I can't compare to those bunch...

Amiya:
You're a super mighty teacher to me, Savage! You can make really nice food for me, you do work really well, and you've told me so many stories from Rim Billiton...

Amiya:
Also, I know, you like keeping me company... you look after me just like a real big sister would.

Amiya:
I know it'll be very scary when you leave... but, cooking today made me really happy. Thanks to this memory, I won't be so scared in the future.

Savage:
Same for me, Amiya. Coming to Babel, getting to see you all happy finding me for a chat, playing together, cooking... I've been so glad all this time.

Savage:
So, knowing we're about to part, I'm gonna be very sad too.

Savage:
But, I won't ever let you look at me and worry.

Savage:
Amiya, living upon this vast world, each of us has things we need to do.

Savage:
You'll find your own direction, your own forward in the future, I promise. If we have the same beliefs... we'll definitely see each other again.

Savage:
I'll strive to move forward. Amiya, you too...

Savage:
Grow up safe and sound.

......

A normal, unremarkable day.

Amiya has sought you out surprisingly early, bringing up the Rim Billiton delicacies coming this noon with expectation in her voice.

Obviously, after the privilege of five healthy meals in a row, it's a very hard invitation to resist.

Amiya:
I've been looking forward to this 'banquet' for forever. Savage will meet almost any request I have, but it's cooking alone where she won't budge an inch.

Amiya:
No formal invitations until all the ingredients were completely ready. Not the slightest thing could be lacking.

Amiya:
Hehe... she's always had me act like such a spoiled child towards her. Besides, Savage makes such tasty food.

Amiya:
Oh, its taste might be on the tame side for some Operators, but it suits my palate very well. How do I put it? It has a flavor that brings back memories of the home you came from...

Amiya:
Ah, but I'm sure you'll like it too, Doctor. After all...

Amiya:
Not really! I just wanted to share this with you... Savage welcomes you as a special guest, too.

Amiya:
We've been friends with Savage since long, long ago, so I know the food she makes is going to be delicious!

Amiya:
It's true, she knew you then, and made you Rim Billiton delicacies many times before, too.

Amiya:
No need to worry, Doctor. To me and Savage both, you're someone utterly dependable, and worthy of trust.

Amiya:
I expect she's looking forward to this meal as a gift for you too, Doctor, for meeting once again.

Amiya:
She isn't just adept at food preparation, she's also very exact with raw ingredients too.

Amiya:
Hmm... but I have no idea why tinned carrots from Rim Billiton were so hard to buy this year. They were the most important ingredient...

Amiya:
It wasn't just rising prices. Procurement channels have dropped off, too.

Amiya:
For Rim Billitonians, carrots are essentially a most beloved food, and demand far outstrips supply for them on the market. They get even scarcer when you want to order goods you can send to Rhodes Island...

Amiya:
Of course, more places besides Rim Billiton grow carrots. There'll be all sorts of different varieties in places all unalike. But Savage said...

Amiya:
'If it's not Rim Billiton's sweet, crisp kind, it's not gonna do, Amiya. I'll have you tasting the delicacy from your memories, just you wait!'

Amiya:
Haha... I'm looking forward to it, Doctor.

Amiya:
Savage and I haven't seen each other in so long.

Amiya:
But the fact she's still willing to treat me like she did in the past, that... really reassures me...

???:
...Sit yourself... down!

Amiya:
Eep!

Amiya:
That voice came from the dining hall... did something happen to Savage in there?

Leonhardt:
Aaah—hmp! ...Delish! Thank you for the food, Savage!

Ayerscarpe:
(Rapid chewing)

Savage:
Oh, fine, you're welcome.

April:
Th-This pie tastes so... so professional.

Savage:
Heh-heh... no surprises there, no surprises. There's no one out there who can brush off my handiwork.

Leonhardt:
April, you want to try some of mine too? It's all the rage in Victorian eating right now, you just take anything and dump loaaads—and loads of ketchup on it!

Savage:
No! You've already used up two whole bottles on this! You can't even taste the original flavor anymore, you naughty little kid!

Leonhardt:
Heheh, how about you try my special portion then, Ayers? It's the taste of innovation!

Ayerscarpe:
I always abide by the original flavors. Eat your grotesquely revised pie yourself...

Leonhardt:
Huh? Don't be a bore, Ayers! Get a little more creativity in you.

Leonhardt:
When we were in Victoria, every time we went to a restaurant, we'd see customers ordering a pie just like this, and then squeezing at least four ketchup packets onto it.

Leonhardt:
'The healthiest part of the food's actually the complimentary ketchup sachets,' didn't they always say that at all the fast food places?

April:
You are not comparing Savage's pie to a fast food joint.

April:
Everything about it's so perfect, from the heat control to the aroma...

April:
I feel like it's been ages since I tried this flavor. It's a scent you'd get while running around outside... is it nostalgia, maybe...

Leonhardt:
Yeah? I think it's pretty good, right?

April:
How is it you have no idea how to read the mood?

Ayerscarpe:
Leon's trying to say that as a Catastrophe Messenger, he's already used to a life of long spates without any Rim Billiton food available. Being too dependent on your home's dishes... makes it hard to carry on outside.

Leonhardt:
That's right. By the way, let me tell you something cool, April, while we were traveling out there, we saw another way to eat pie, where you have to grab it with your hands, and then you jump into the air—

April:
Wagh! Careful, you're gonna drop it, you're gonna drop the pie...!

Savage:
Hol—Hold on, other people are still working right now, settle down a little... Leonhardt, sit still!

Leonhardt:
Aw, okay...

Amiya:
Excuse me...

April & Ayerscarpe:
Ah.

Leonhardt:
Whoa, it's Amiya and the Doctor—

Amiya:
So you were all dining, then.

Leonhardt:
No, we weren't, this was, uh, Savage inviting us for a 'taste-of-home sampling party'...

Savage:
You've made such a mess of the dining hall. Sorry, Amiya, Doctor, I'll tidy it all up soon.

Amiya:
It's okay, we're here to sample Savage's culinary delicacies, too. Let's all clean up afterwards.

Ayerscarpe:
Egg on your face, Leon.

Leonhardt:
I thought it'd be fine to act a little cool with just us four... April, I'll show you that special eating method next time.
