Vulcan's Workshop

Vulcan:
Kay.

Ceobe:
What is it, Vulcan  ?

Ceobe:
Need my help?

Vulcan:
When was the last time you performed maintenance on your equipment?

Ceobe:
Well...

Ceobe:
Let me think.

Ceobe:
One... Two...

Ceobe:
(Ceobe counts on her fingers)

Ceobe:
Fifteen days, I think?

Vulcan:
It's about time. You'd better get to work on them.

Ceobe:
Okay.

Vulcan:
You still have that maintenance diagram I drew for you?

Ceobe:
Yup! I hung it up in my room.

Vulcan:
Are there sufficient tools and consumables in that room? If you've run out, you can take some now.

Ceobe:
There's enough!

Vulcan:
Good.

Vulcan:
Let's clean up and pack up. Then we can head out when the fire dies down.

Ceobe:
Leave? Are you going out?

Vulcan:
Yes, I have to go check on the boiler room, then collect the materials I ordered from the warehouse  . Don't have time to worry about the fire.

Ceobe:
I can watch the fire.

Vulcan:
That's not a good job   for you.

Vulcan:
You have things you need to do as well, right?

Ceobe:
I guess.

Vulcan:
Almost time. Let's go.

Vulcan:
I made you a lunch, remember to take it when you leave.

Vulcan:
I'll come find you when I finish.

Ceobe:
Okay, Vulcan  .

Vulcan:
Right, see you later.

Ceobe:
Come back soon!

Ceobe:
Oh... She's gone...

Ceobe:
What... should I do...?

Ceobe:
Hmm...

Ceobe:
I'll go to my room to take care of my babies   then.

Dormitories

Ceobe's Room

Ceobe:
This...  The picture   says vegetable oil.

Ceobe:
Vegetable oil?

Ceobe:
Is it... this?

Ceobe:
The label says——Vege... table... Oil...!

Ceobe:
I got it!

Ceobe:
What's the next step?

Ceobe:
Hmm...

Ceobe:
Dip the cloth into the oil, then slowly rub all the shiny parts.

Ceobe:
Yup, just like that!

Ceobe:
I remember it super clearly.

Ceobe:
Hehe.

Ceobe:
I wonder what Vulcan will say when she sees how good   I did? Maybe I'll get a gift?

Ceobe:
She made a top   for me last time. It's so fun to spin!

Ceobe:
Maybe I'll get something even better this time.

Ceobe:
Hm...

Ceobe:
I've never tasted oil before.

Ceobe:
Since it's food for my babies, it must taste good.

Ceobe:
(Ceobe dips her finger in the oil and licks it)

Ceobe:
Blech.

Ceobe:
Looks like I can't eat the food my babies like.

Ceobe:
And here I thought maybe we'd have something to enjoy together.

Ceobe:
Hmph.

Ceobe:
Back to work.

Ceobe:
Hmm...

Ceobe:
Okay, I'm done!

Ceobe:
What to do next?

Ceobe:
Oh, I have to wipe oil on other parts.

Ceobe:
With different oils too.

Ceobe:
Yeah.

Ceobe:
......

A long, long time later...

Ceobe:
I think I'm almost done.

Ceobe:
I'm kinda hungry.

Ceobe:
Okay, lunch time, lunch time.

Ceobe:
Today's lunch is——

Ceobe:
Grilled meatbeast chop! And mashed potatoes with sauce!

Ceobe:
Wow!

Ceobe:
Awawawa!!!

Ceobe:
Ah——finished!

Ceobe:
Vulcan is so good at crafting anything, even food!

Ceobe:
But——I'm still a little hungry——

Ceobe:
Hm, what time is it now?

Ceobe:
Oh, eleven... eleven fifteen... It's noon!

Ceobe:
It's time for everyone to eat!

Ceobe:
Which means——

Ceobe:
Yay!

Ceobe:
Away!!!

11:30 A.M.

Rhodes Island Cafeteria

Ceobe:
Wow, there's a lot of people here!

Ceobe:
Let's see what food they have.

Ceobe:
W-Wow!

Ceobe:
Wow!!

Courier:
Hello, Ceobe. What do you want to eat?

Ceobe:
I'm looking.

Ceobe:
(Since there's so much good food here, there must be more inside!)

Ceobe:
(Okay, let me think how to sneak inside.)

Courier:
Are you going to order?

Ceobe:
No, I don't need to  .

Ceobe:
Bye!

Courier:
See you.

Gitano:
Courier, the food for your counter is almost here. Be ready.

Courier:
Okay.

Courier:
(Whisper) She's here.

Gitano:
(Whisper) Understood.

Ceobe:
Vulcan taught me to watch closely and wait for a chance.

Ceobe:
I didn't watch enough last time and the old guy caught me at the door...

Ceobe:
But this time will be different!

Ceobe:
I'll definitely get inside!

Ceobe:
Mmm——

Ceobe:
......

Gitano:
Shchi, huh? If I recall correctly, it goes there in the middle, where Courier is standing.

Gummy:
Alright.

Ceobe:
(The door is close to my hiding spot.)

Ceobe:
(There's a pretty lady by the door, I can't let her see me.)

Ceobe:
(Little Cub is talking to her.)

Ceobe:
(There's a lot of tasty stuff next to her, but people are watching.)

Ceobe:
(There's a little hole further away. I think it is for dishes. I can't get through it.)

Ceobe:
(The door is my only choice.)

Ceobe:
(But the door's so crowded still.)

Ceobe:
(Hmm, I'll wait   a while more.)

Ceobe:
(Okay the door is quieter now.)

Ceobe:
(No one's there!)

Ceobe:
(Now's my chance!)

Ceobe:
(Go!!!)

Ceobe:
Yummy goodies, here I come!

Gummy:
Wooaahh! Kay, you can't go in there!

Ceobe:
I can't?

Gummy:
You can't! Don't you see the sign on the door?

Ceobe:
I see it.

Ceobe:
I see a red circle with a tilty red line going through it.

Ceobe:
I also see Kay.

Gummy:
That means 'Kay is not allowed in here.' Got it?

Ceobe:
Got it.

Gummy:
If you get it, why are you still going in?!

Ceobe:
Hungry.

Gummy:
If you're hungry, you can just get in line and order something to eat.

Ceobe:
Hungry.

Gummy:
Y-You're not allowed in there!

Ceobe:
But I'm hungry!

Gummy:
Fine, fine! I'll think of something!!

Gummy:
Hmm...

Gummy:
What if I...

Gummy:
If I give you this cookie, will you promise not to go inside?

Ceobe:
*sniff* *sniff*

Ceobe:
Mm!

Ceobe:
Okay, okay!

Gummy:
Here...

Ceobe:
Thanks!

Not long afterwards...

Ceobe:
Little Cub's cookie was tasty.

Ceobe:
But I'm still hungry...

Ceobe:
Sorry Little Cub, I still want to go in.

Ceobe:
Maybe I got found out because I was too excited.

Ceobe:
I won't make the same mistake again!

Ceobe:
Hm, let's see...

Ceobe:
......

Ceobe:
(The only one by the door is the pretty lady at the counter.)

Ceobe:
(The door is still open?!)

Ceobe:
(Wow!)

Ceobe:
(There's bread in that basket!)

Ceobe:
(Smells so fresh!)

Ceobe:
(I wanna eat it!)

Ceobe:
Yummy yummy goodies, here I come!!

Ceobe:
Ah.

Gitano:
What is it? Where are you going?

Ceobe:
(Oh no, I got caught!)

Ceobe:
Ah...

Ceobe:
Urk... Ahhh...

Ceobe:
(What do I do?! What do I do?!)

Ceobe:
(!)

Ceobe:
I-I want to go to the toilet.

Gitano:
This isn't the toilet. There's a sign over there, look for the one with the blue and pink people.

Ceobe:
Oh, I see!

Ceobe:
Thanks, pretty lady!

Gitano:
No problem, don't make the same mistake next time.

Ceobe:
Got it!

Ceobe:
(Ahh, I'm lucky she didn't figure me out. I don't want Vulcan to get mad at me.)

Gitano:
......

Dur-nar:
Gitano, the last dish is here.

Gitano:
Ah, good job. This should go to the farthest corner where Noir Corne is.

Dur-nar:
Alright...

Gitano:
What's up?

Dur-nar:
Nothing really, Gummy bit me.

Gitano:
Ooh, I didn't know you two were THAT close.

Dur-nar:
Don't joke about it, it hurts.

Gitano:
Hm-hmm.

Gitano:
Oh, right.

Dur-nar:
Huh?

Gitano:
Put two standard meal sets at the prep station near the kitchen door.

Dur-nar:
To feed the Perro?

Gitano:
I'm good.

Dur-nar:
Sure, I'll tell the cooks.

Dur-nar:
O-Owww...

Gitano:
Maybe it'll go numb later?

Dur-nar:
Please no. Spare me...

Gitano:
I'm just joking~

Dur-nar:
If you're joking, doesn't that mean I'm done for...

Gitano:
Of course not.

Gitano:
Go on, we can wrap up and have lunch soon.

Dur-nar:
Okay...

Ceobe:
I'll make it this time!

Ceobe:
Let's see.

Ceobe:
......

Ceobe:
There's no one there at all.

Ceobe:
Even the pretty lady by the door is gone.

Ceobe:
Yay!

Ceobe:
Hah!

Ceobe:
Hehe, the door is unlocked.

Ceobe:
I'm going in!

Ceobe:
Ohh! There really was food here!

Ceobe:
How is the taste——

Ceobe:
Wow, it's tasty!

Ceobe:
So good!

Ceobe:
Awawa.

Ceobe:
Ah, I'm so happy I got to eat!

Ceobe:
I better go home and finish taking care of my babies!

Ceobe:
Hmm...

Ceobe:
Just now, wasn't Little Cub's tummy rumbling?

Ceobe:
Is she hungry because she gave her cookie to me?

Ceobe:
Poor Little Cub...

Ceobe:
Vulcan says that when people help you, you should pay it back double or triple or whatever's even more than those, I forgot! Fourple?

Ceobe:
Anyway, Little Cub gave me a small cookie, so I should give her a really really really——big cookie.

Ceobe:
Okay, I'll make it as soon as Vulcan gets back!

Ceobe:
Now I need to go home and finish up my work.

Ceobe's Room

Ceobe:
Hm...

Ceobe:
Hmm...

Ceobe:
Weapons are done.

Ceobe:
The covers for the weapons and the bag are clean.

Ceobe:
Just one last thing left.

Ceobe:
Vulcan, please hurry back, so Little Cub won't be hungry anymore...

Ceobe:
Who's there?

Vulcan:
It's me.

Ceobe:
Ah, Vulcan! I'll get the door!

Ceobe:
You came back really early today.

Vulcan:
Work went nice and smooth today, finished quick.

Vulcan:
Can you let me see your maintenance work?

Ceobe:
Okay, okay!

Ceobe:
I just finished, the weapons are all neat on the table!

Vulcan:
Great, I'll have a look.

Vulcan:
......

Ceobe:
(I did it just like the pictures  .)

Ceobe:
(I have to believe in myself!)

Ceobe:
(I know I did it right!)

Ceobe:
H-How is it?

Vulcan:
The oil is applied very evenly.

Vulcan:
(Vulcan lifts the weapon and sniffs it)

Vulcan:
The right oils, too.

Vulcan:
Oh?

Vulcan:
You cleaned the sheaths?

Ceobe:
Yup!

Vulcan:
Good.

Vulcan:
You did a good job.

Ceobe:
Thanks, Vulcan!

Ceobe:
Ehehe.

Vulcan:
I'm going back to the workshop. Do you want to come along?

Ceobe:
Mm!

Vulcan's Workshop

Vulcan:
This is a good batch of material here.

Vulcan:
Hope I can make something satisfying out of it.

Ceobe:
(Go on, say it, say it! Little Cub is still starving!)

Ceobe:
(B-But, I'm a little nervous...)

Ceobe:
......

Vulcan:
What's wrong? Is there anything you want to tell me?

Ceobe:
Oh, umm, well...

Vulcan:
Yes.

Ceobe:
Can you teach me how to make a big cookie?!

Vulcan:
Oh? You want to make your own food, finally?

Ceobe:
Y-Yeah!

Ceobe:
Please, teach me quickly! Little Cub is gonna starve to death soon!

Vulcan:
Little Cub... you mean... Gummy?

Ceobe:
Ah, uhh, yeah!

Ceobe:
Noon... Yeah, noon! I saw Little Cub at noon!

Ceobe:
She gave me a really tasty cookie! So I want to give Little Cub an even bigger, even tastier one! But, I don't know how to make a cookie, and I don't know where Little Cub lives either, I-I——

Ceobe:
So I, uhh, I——

Vulcan:
I understand.

Ceobe:
Vulcan, I——

Vulcan:
You'll twist your tongue in a knot if you keep talking.

Ceobe:
Sorry... I-I'm in a bit of a hurry...

Vulcan:
Mm, alright.

Vulcan:
Now, listen to me.

Ceobe:
Alright...

Vulcan:
I know where she lives.

Vulcan:
I'll teach you how to make the treat, then bring you there.

Ceobe:
Really?!

Vulcan:
I'm always willing to teach if you're willing to learn.

Ceobe:
I want to learn!

Vulcan:
I happen to have some fermented dough here. Let's make a huge cookie, okay?

Ceobe:
Okay!

Vulcan:
How big do you want it to be?

Ceobe:
The bigger the better!

Vulcan:
Alright.

Vulcan:
Help me clear the workspace. I'll get the fire going.

Ceobe:
Got it!

Vulcan:
Preparations are just about done.

Vulcan:
Did you wash your hands, Kay?

Ceobe:
Yup!

Ceobe:
Wow, what's this?

Vulcan:
Dough.

Ceobe:
What should I do?

Vulcan:
Simple, just knead the dough.

Vulcan:
Just try it and see. I'll let you know if you're doing it wrong.

Ceobe:
Kneading the dough...

Ceobe:
Like this?

Vulcan:
Yes, continue.

Vulcan:
Don't be afraid to crush it, put some force into it.

Vulcan:
Knead it for a few more minutes.

Vulcan:
Alright, that should be enough. Spread it on the board.

Vulcan:
Cut it in half with the knife.

Ceobe:
Like this?

Vulcan:
Yep.

Vulcan:
Then press each half into a circle.

Vulcan:
Correct.

Vulcan:
We won't use any stuffing this time. I'll teach you how to prepare the stuffing and how to make pies when you're better at this.

Vulcan:
You missed a spot here, yes, here.

Vulcan:
Alright, not bad.

Vulcan:
Take the dough on the board and put it into the oven.  Use these mitts for safety.

Ceobe:
Okay.

Ceobe:
On the rack in the oven?

Vulcan:
Correct.

Ceobe:
Okay——It's in!

Ceobe:
Making cookies is so easy!

Ceobe:
What else do I need to do?

Vulcan:
Watch the time.

Ceobe:
Ahh——

Ceobe:
That's hard.

Around ten minutes later...

Vulcan:
Kay.

Ceobe:
Hm... hm?

Vulcan:
It's time to take the cookie out.

Ceobe:
It's time?!

Vulcan:
Yes.

Ceobe:
Ohhh!

Ceobe:
Ah!

Vulcan:
Wait!

Vulcan:
Put these mitts on first.

Ceobe:
R-Right!

Vulcan:
Just place it on the table and it's done.

Ceobe:
O——kay.

Ceobe:
*sniff* *sniff*

Ceobe:
It smells nice.

Ceobe:
It must be really tasty.

Ceobe:
Let me taste it.

Ceobe:
(Ceobe breaks off a piece and chews it)

Vulcan:
What do you think?

Ceobe:
It's tasty!

Ceobe:
Cookies are best when they're still hot.

Ceobe:
I have to give this to Little Cub quickly.

Vulcan:
I'll put it between these wooden boards, so it'll stay warm longer.

Vulcan:
I'll guide you this time, but you have to go by yourself next time, got it?

Ceobe:
Got it!

Dormitories

Outside Gummy's Place

Vulcan:
We're here.

Ceobe:
Got it!

Ceobe:
(Ceobe rings the bell)

*Ding Dong*

???:
Come in, the door is open!

Ceobe:
(Ceobe pokes her head in)

Ceobe:
Is Little Cub here?

Gummy:
Hm?

Ceobe:
There you are!

Gummy:
Eh?

Ceobe:
Hiya.

Ceobe:
I ate your cookie earlier, so I got you a new one.

Ceobe:
Vulcan taught me how to make it. It's fresh outta the oven.

Gummy:
Isn't it... kinda big?

Ceobe:
Hurry up and eat it before it gets cold.

Ceobe:
Bye bye.

Vulcan:
How did it go?

Ceobe:
Little Cub looked very happy.

Vulcan:
Oh? That's great.

Ceobe:
Vulcan.

Vulcan:
Huh?

Ceobe:
Thank you!

Vulcan:
Heh.

Vulcan:
You don't have to thank me.

Vulcan:
Learn to do it well and you can make cookies by yourself next time.

Vulcan:
Who knows, you might even be able to make your own honey biscuits one day.

Ceobe:
Wow, that sounds good!

Vulcan:
Doesn't it?

Ceobe:
But I think I'd still eat your honey biscuits, Vulcan  !

Vulcan:
Really?

Ceobe:
Yup!

Vulcan:
Oh, that sounds good too.

Vulcan:
Let's go back. We can't leave the fire alone for too long.

Vulcan:
Besides, you haven't finished eating the other cookie yet.

Ceobe:
Oh, right!

Ceobe:
I was in such a rush to bring the cookie to Little Cub, I forgot my own.

Vulcan:
That kind of cookie is fine for filling your stomach, but it still lacks a little something to make it really delicious.

Ceobe:
?!

Vulcan:
Do you remember the meat sauce from last time?

Ceobe:
Mm!

Vulcan:
Want to dip your cookie in it?

Ceobe:
Yes!

Vulcan:
Let's go then.

Vulcan:
I'm a little hungry too.

Ceobe:
Got it!

Ceobe:
Yummy goodies, here I come!
