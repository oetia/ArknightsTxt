Blemishine:
A group of bandits who fled here... So Rhodes Island takes jobs like this too?

Caster Operator:
Yep. Given our branch offices operate under all sorts of conditions all across the world, any weird and wild commission could come to our doors.

Guard Operator:
But it IS usually just responding to some Infected or Originium.

Guard Operator:
According to the info the office gave, the village militia'll help us with the operation. Says their chief's a pretty impressive one.

Blemishine:
We already spent a chunk of time just getting here. I hope nothing happened in the meanwhile...

Young Hunter:
You're Rhodes Island, here to help us catch the bandits?

Blemishine:
Yes, we are.

Blemishine:
You're the head of the village militia. Was Lanton the name?

Young Hunter:
No, I'm his brother Landi. The thing with him, well...

Young Hunter:
Not long ago, while he was leading a team on patrol, they got attacked. The others were alright, but he went missing. We've searched for ages without turning up any trace of him, so now it's up to me to lead the militia until we get him back.

Blemishine:
I'm sorry. If we'd only come a bit sooner...

Young Hunter:
It's not your fault. It takes time for Messengers to pass the word on, after all.

Young Hunter:
I'm just hoping you can help out with catching those bandits. It'll take a weight off the village's shoulders.

Blemishine:
Our intel says a group of bandits stole a merchant caravan's Originium weapons, and then fled this way.

Blemishine:
That tells us these bandits are no pushovers.

Blemishine:
Right now, it's highly likely they're eyeing the village, so all of you stay here to protect against potential raids.

Young Hunter:
But––

Militiaman A:
They're going, so it's up to us. No harm in that.

Young Hunter:
Gerain, those bandits are the reason my brother's missing now!

Militiaman A:
And? Lanton's the strongest in the village. If they can send him missing, what good'll we do if we go?

Militiaman A:
And what good'll you do, Landi?

Young Hunter:
I don't want an argument with you.

Young Hunter:
Only catching these bandits can bring peace to the village.

Militiaman A:
How? With your 'superior' command skills? No idea how we usually patrol, no idea how we even form our squads, is that all it takes?

Militiaman A:
Or your 'genius' leadership where you can't even remember all our names?

Militiaman A:
You can't seriously think you're Lanton, can you?

Young Hunter:
Come again?!

Militiaman A:
That's my point for today.

Militiaman A:
Do you think we see you as a decent stand-in for the captain? You're just a shame on Lanton, that's it.

Militiaman A:
You've never drilled with us, all you do is hunt in the mountains all day. The idea of protecting the village's never even occurred to you.

Militiaman A:
Lanton's gone, and you suddenly pipe up saying you'll be our militia chief in place of him? What good is you protecting the village going to do? What's going on in your head?

Militiaman A:
Look, you even made a point of carrying Lanton's sword. Who are you fooling?

Militiaman A:
Back me up here!

Militiaman B:
He's right! I got fed up a long time ago.

Militiaman C:
Damn straight. What gives you the right to boss us around, Landi?

Militiaman B:
Alright, let's go, forget him!

Militiaman A:
There it is. Enough, Landi. Leave it to these outsiders.

Militiaman A:
They'll get a lot more done than you, that much's plain to see.

Young Hunter:
......

Blemishine:
......

Nightmare Knight:
Your dream is taken from another. Your conviction is borrowed.

Nightmare Knight:
You use your young age as an excuse for your confusion... but what point is there?

Nightmare Knight:
The world can laugh at the Radiant Knight's stubbornness, but no one may refute the strength in her actions.

Nightmare Knight:
Yet you... you are not even a knight.

Blemishine:
Well...

Young Hunter:
No bearing on me if they don't go. I'll be following you.

Blemishine:
But...

Young Hunter:
You'll need someone to show the way, right?

Caster Operator:
Let him come with, Blemishine.

Blemishine:
Alright...

Young Hunter:
I haven't seen anyone fishy around this area, or any signs people stopped over.

Guard Operator:
Not bad, dude. Didn't think you could actually walk it on top of talking it.

Caster Operator:
If you can't think about what to say, I suggest you keep your mouth shut.

Young Hunter:
It's alright. Hunting really is the only thing I'm good for.

Young Hunter:
Let's go and check ahead.

Young Hunter:
Also... I'm sorry. For that whole scene you had to see.

Young Hunter:
It's not that they're unwilling to help you, they're just not willing to help me.

Blemishine:
Why are they so opposed to you?

Young Hunter:
Because... I guess because I've taken up my brother's post.

Young Hunter:
My grandpa was the last militia chief. He trained Lanton and me when we were little.

Young Hunter:
We're right on the border here. Bandits on the run, bounty hunters, you name it, they show up in droves. Once we were grown, Grandpa wanted us to protect the village from harm, together.

Young Hunter:
But—I'm not even good at people like my brother is. I'm better off alone.

Young Hunter:
It's like they said, I've never drilled with them. I just like hunting in the mountains on my own.

Young Hunter:
Lanton understood how I felt, so he became militia leader.

Young Hunter:
That was never a problem, up until he went missing.

Blemishine:
......

Young Hunter:
(Exhale)...

Blemishine:
The sword you're using now—that's your brother's?

Young Hunter:
Yes.

Young Hunter:
It's his saber. Apparently, it was found close to where he went missing.

Young Hunter:
I picked it up because I wanted to use it on those bandits who hurt him.

Blemishine:
This sword's too heavy for you. It's not a good fit for you at all.

Young Hunter:
That's alright. I'll use it to make the bandits pay.

Blemishine:
But––

Blemishine:
Watch out!

Blemishine:
......!

Blemishine:
Hnph!

Young Hunter:
Who are you?!

Bandit:
Dammit.

Young Hunter:
Hold it!

Blemishine:
Wait, don't just run off!

Blemishine:
Ugh, take them down first!

Young Hunter:
Stay where you are!

Bandit:
......

Young Hunter:
Lanton, it's you, isn't it?

Elder Hunter:
...Landi.

Young Hunter:
Lanton, your clothes. The bandits who attacked us were wearing these.

Young Hunter:
Why?

Elder Hunter:
You've always been smart. You should be able to guess.

Young Hunter:
This means you're working with those bandits...

Elder Hunter:
Right.

Young Hunter:
Why?

Elder Hunter:
I don't want to be trapped in a remote hellhole like that all my life, Landi.

Elder Hunter:
I don't want to spend my whole life bossing around some idiots forever.

Elder Hunter:
That's all there is to it.

Young Hunter:
Lanton!

Bandit:
Guh...

Blemishine:
That's a decent number of targets...

Caster Operator:
Blemishine, leave this to us. You go find Landi.

Blemishine:
But...

Caster Operator:
You probably have a bad feeling about this, just like I do.

Blemishine:
Right.

Caster Operator:
Then go. Don't wait around to confirm that feeling.

Caster Operator:
Relax. We can handle this thing.

Guard Operator:
Sure can.

Blemishine:
Got it!

Elder Hunter:
Landi, why are you holding my sword?

Young Hunter:
......

Elder Hunter:
Didn't you always think my sword was too heavy? Always saying your dagger fit you better?

Young Hunter:
You obviously know why.

Young Hunter:
You weren't like this before.

Elder Hunter:
Oh, I wasn't?

Elder Hunter:
This is how I should be, then.

Elder Hunter:
I always had to protect the village, to be a role model. I never truly let myself loose.

Elder Hunter:
I never experienced what it's like to mouth off at people.

Elder Hunter:
And now I know! It feels amazing!

Young Hunter:
Gngh...

Blemishine:
I hear them talking. They're right in front...

Blemishine:
Landi—

Elder Hunter:
And you, Landi.

Elder Hunter:
You know, I've always wanted to be like you, no one's lives on my back, just me looking after myself, going into the mountains to hunt, day in, day out, right?

Elder Hunter:
And now, I know how you feel.

Elder Hunter:
It's great, absolutely great! No wonder you never got sick of it!

Young Hunter:
......

Young Hunter:
Lanton, was it my fault you had to take up all that responsibility?

Margaret:
Maria, tell me the truth.

Margaret:
Did I rob you of your dreams?

Blemishine:
......

Elder Hunter:
Maybe.

Elder Hunter:
All I can tell you is I plan to experience a hell of a lot I never experienced before. Steal a thing or two, burn a building or three.

Elder Hunter:
Maybe even... kill a couple people.

Lanton raises the knife in his hands, brandishing it at Landi without an ounce of hesitation.

As if it wasn't his younger brother before him, but a simple logjam blocking his way.

Blemishine:
Stop!

Elder Hunter:
Hmph... your backup's here, huh.

Blemishine:
You'd kill your own brother?!

Elder Hunter:
Why not? I chose this path. He might be my brother, but right now he's in my way.

Blemishine:
Landi, get up!

Blemishine:
You're supposed to protect the village!

Young Hunter:
Lanton...

Young Hunter:
I know this is partially my fault, that you turned into this. I'm so sorry.

Young Hunter:
But if you're going to destroy the village over it... then I'll stop you.

Young Hunter:
I'm going to protect our village!

Elder Hunter:
Protect it?

Elder Hunter:
What are you talking about, Landi?

Elder Hunter:
When have you ever protected the village?

Elder Hunter:
What have you done for the village that gives you the right to talk yourself up like this?

Elder Hunter:
Do Gerain and the rest put any faith in you? Do you know how to assign them? Do you know what a militiaman should do? You know jack squat.

Elder Hunter:
And even then, you've got the nerve to come up to me and say you're going to protect the village?

Young Hunter:
I'll learn how!

Elder Hunter:
When? Now? Not going to happen, little brother.

Blemishine:
Don't force your selfishness onto others!

Elder Hunter:
Stop her!

Blemishine:
Ungh.

Elder Hunter:
Landi, you ought to carry on with your little life.

Elder Hunter:
And after I destroy the village, you ought to run.

Elder Hunter:
You, standing here now, all righteous while you tell me things I used to say, pretending the dream I had is now yours...

Elder Hunter:
You look absolutely ridiculous.

Young Hunter:
Why?! Am I wrong for wanting to protect the village?!

Elder Hunter:
You're not wrong, you're just—

Elder Hunter:
A little late to it.

With a 'clang,' the sword in Landi's hand breaks in two.

Young Hunter:
Guh... ahh...

Elder Hunter:
No more dreaming, Landi.

Elder Hunter:
Leave the village. Find somewhere new to live.

Blemishine:
Landi...

Young Hunter:
......

Young Hunter:
Blemishine, am I really the one in the wrong?

Young Hunter:
Was it my fault for not sharing some of my brother's responsibility a bit sooner?

Young Hunter:
For being so selfish, just looking after myself?

Blemishine:
......

How should I answer him?

Should I tell him he's wrong? But is he really wrong?

Should I tell him he's right? But does he really believe it?

Guard Operator:
Blemishine! Are you guys alright?

Blemishine:
We're fine... what about over there?

Guard Operator:
I caught two suckers, and shook the position of the bandit stronghold from them. We can head there now to sweep them up, no problem.

Caster Operator:
There are more of them than we estimated. With just the few of us, we probably have no way of clearing them out in one go.

Caster Operator:
We need to head back and mobilize that village militia.

Blemishine:
Alright. Let's go, then.

In a confined room, the sound of metal on metal rings with no respite.

With a serious look, Blemishine beats away at a metal chunk reddening, as if what she hammers into shape is her own will.

Blemishine:
......

Blemishine:
Margaret, what he asked his older brother, it's—surprising, actually, how similar it is to what you asked me.

Blemishine:
'Did I rob you of your dreams?'

Blemishine:
But it's the other way round here, funnily enough.

Blemishine:
Honestly, I feel like it's a mutual question.

Blemishine:
I could say, in the past, it was me being obsessed with smithing that made you even more enthusiastic about the knight competitions.

Blemishine:
And when I say that, it's me blaming myself for losing you your right to choose.

Blemishine:
I could also say it was your enthusiasm for knight competitions that led me to get so much more obsessed with smithing.

Blemishine:
But when I say that, it seems like I'm blaming you for losing me my dreams.

Blemishine:
It's like it makes sense either way, and makes no sense either way.

Blemishine:
I kind of understand now. People only put it in terms like these when they're trying to settle accounts.

Blemishine:
In times like these, everyone's just trying to push the guilt onto the other side. They don't actually consider things to be that way.

Blemishine:
In reality, how do you even say things like this straight?

Blemishine:
We grew up together, we impacted each other. That's how we came to understand each other.

Young Hunter:
Blemishine, are you forging a weapon?

Blemishine:
No, it's a sort of way to concentrate that I learned from a colleague named Vulcan.

Blemishine:
It's not to forge weapons, it's to purge my own distracting thoughts.

Blemishine:
Do you want to try it too? It's really effective.

Young Hunter:
Ha ha, not this time.

Young Hunter:
I came to pass on word. Most of the militia are willing to join the bandit clear operation. The village is readying supplies and weapons right now.

Blemishine:
What about you?

Young Hunter:
I...

Blemishine:
......

Blemishine:
To be honest, you're a lot like me.

Blemishine:
I have an older sister, myself.

Blemishine:
My sister's like your brother. She always shouldered a responsibility that, maybe, me and her should've taken on together.

Blemishine:
And I took her protection for granted, doing what I wanted to do.

Blemishine:
As a side note, what I like doing is smithing of all kinds, making all sorts of weapons and equipment. The armor I'm wearing now, I made myself.

Blemishine:
This hunk of metal's not bad. Let's go with it.

Young Hunter:
......

Blemishine:
It was all until one day, because of—certain reasons, my sister was forced to leave home, and go far, far away.

Blemishine:
It was only after that, I realized, how much she was shielding me.

Blemishine:
I'm like you, too, trying to take on the responsibility she once took on for me.

Young Hunter:
Then... did you succeed?

Blemishine:
I failed, eheh.

Blemishine:
When I tried to take that responsibility, I got so much criticism, but out of it all, I think what most cut to the core was—

Blemishine:
Someone said my dreams were borrowed.

Blemishine:
I've never seen the sights my sister saw, and I've never walked the path she went.

Blemishine:
When things seemed like they were about to come crumbling down, it was only then I suddenly realized, oh—it seems like I should do something, and then I went to do it, and practically, I failed.

Blemishine:
Hmm... this furnace is just too old! Once I'm done using it, I think I'll give it a revamp.

Blemishine:
My sister might say I did well, but I know in actuality, it was far from enough.

Blemishine:
The one way I'm luckier is... my sister came back in the end, and once again, she took up the responsibility she held before.

Blemishine:
And she does even more now, and even better.

Young Hunter:
While my brother couldn't stand the burden, and chose to abandon his duty.

Young Hunter:
I already failed.

Young Hunter:
Why even tell me all this?

Blemishine:
I've never regretted my obsession with smithing, and I don't feel my decision to pick up my sister's burden midway was wrong.

Blemishine:
I'm hoping I can pass those ideas onto you.

Young Hunter:
......

Blemishine:
I know I wasn't properly prepared, and I know I wasn't enough to walk the path she walked, in her shoes.

Blemishine:
But even if I've experienced, and confirmed that for myself, I still feel proud of taking that step.

Blemishine:
Maybe I couldn't get far down the way of the knight, but at least I know I didn't stray from my own beliefs.

Young Hunter:
You're so strong.

Blemishine:
Not at all. I'd crumple in training and beg Auntie Zofia to go easy on me, and I almost started crying when Margaret came back.

Blemishine:
And I had no time to work on my beloved smithing.

Blemishine:
But—I don't consider blood ties, or family, or whatever other bonds like that to be an obstacle.

Blemishine:
So, when I've got no option except to take up the responsibility, I don't feel anything wrong with that.

Blemishine:
That's my answer.

Blemishine:
I want to know yours.

Young Hunter:
I always enjoyed all that my brother gave me, took it for granted too.

Young Hunter:
When I saw him like that, I felt guilty.

Young Hunter:
But I'm part of this village, and I still want to protect it.

Young Hunter:
It doesn't matter if I was called a slouch. It doesn't matter if I'm not trusted... I don't want these things to bring me regret.

Young Hunter:
So... I guess what I mean is it's the least I can do to fight off my brother.

Young Hunter:
But I don't know what to do...

Blemishine:
Hand that broken sword over, here.

Blemishine:
I'll forge you a weapon that fits you.

Young Hunter:
Huh?

Blemishine:
That sword's too heavy for you. It'll make your center of gravity wildly unstable, and you won't have a good hold over the power.

Blemishine:
You can't deploy your full strength using a weapon that doesn't suit you.

Blemishine:
If my sister was here, she'd head the charge on their camp. She'd topple every last one of them.

Blemishine:
But I'm a craftsman, and the way craftsmen help others, is by putting the best tools in their hands, making them stronger still.

Young Hunter:
Okay!

Blemishine:
......

Blemishine:
Margaret, in some sense, aren't these brothers just us from another timeline?

Blemishine:
One where you renounced the path of knighthood, wandered the four corners of the land.

Blemishine:
And I took on your ideals for real, and I became a true knight.

Blemishine:
Wow, just what kind of world would that've been? I can't imagine you having fallen at all, and I can't picture me becoming a real knight either.

Blemishine:
But the knight novels have those sorts of knights too, who've fallen from grace while still holding fast to their creeds. That also seems really cool, in a way.

Blemishine:
Ugh. Purge my thoughts, purge my thoughts.

Militiaman A:
......

Young Hunter:
......

Militiaman A:
I heard the story. Lanton's...

Young Hunter:
Gerain, I'm sorry...

Militiaman A:
What are you sorry for? He betrayed us, so now, he's the enemy. Simple as that.

Young Hunter:
Gerain, from today, I'll be joining you for training.

Militiaman A:
What's this? You can't still be treating yourself like Lanton now?

Young Hunter:
I'm not treating myself like him. I'm just treating myself as this village's militia chief.

Militiaman A:
Whatever.

Several days later...

Young Hunter:
Hah!

Guard Operator:
Whew, that's some tricksy blade.

Caster Operator:
Can you block him?

Guard Operator:
Sure. But those last few moves just now, at the very least they're closing on an investigative operator's standard.

Guard Operator:
Blooming like this in just a few short days, we could refer him to join us if we get the chance.

Blemishine:
Ohh, I'm having a little flashback to the time Auntie Zofia was training me...

Blemishine:
How did she throw moves at me, again... ah, right, like this, probably!

Blemishine:
Take this!

Young Hunter:
Ngh...

Blemishine:
Plus my own follow-up!

Young Hunter:
Blemishine, to be honest, I'm already more or less used to the effects of your Arts.

Militiaman A:
Look at him, he puts on a pretty good show when he fights serious.

Militiaman B:
Seriously, what's Landi been doing coming to train with us the last few days?

Militiaman A:
Hmph. It's what he should've been doing all along.

Young Hunter:
Right here!

Blemishine:
Shame I already figured you'd gotten used to it. That's why I readied my posture way in advance!

Blemishine:
But you've shaped up massively, haven't you!

Young Hunter:
Let's go again!

Blemishine:
Hold on, come with me.

Blemishine:
Here. It's the longsword I forged for you.

Young Hunter:
It's just like Lanton's...

Blemishine:
Yep, I made it according to that form~ Try wielding it a little.

Young Hunter:
So light...

Blemishine:
How is it? Feels a lot easier to use, right?

Young Hunter:
I really don't know how I should thank you...

Blemishine:
It's alright, don't worry! I'm just glad seeing you cheer up!

Blemishine:
Now then, let's set out, and get all those bandits dealt with!

Young Hunter:
Okay!

Elder Hunter:
Hmph, you came after all.

Young Hunter:
You don't seem surprised.

Elder Hunter:
We need time to prep resources to attack the village, you need time to prep resources to wipe us out. It's a game of speed.

Elder Hunter:
You've won, that's all. Nothing to be surprised at there.

Young Hunter:
Lanton...

Blemishine:
Leave the others to us. He's yours, Landi.

Young Hunter:
Right.

Elder Hunter:
Looks like you chose to take on my burden... Here I thought, after breaking that sword, you could find some freedom too.

Young Hunter:
I won't judge you, Lanton. But—I don't think you can truly gain freedom by running away from your responsibilities.

Elder Hunter:
That's just because you haven't fled far enough. Haven't gone all the way.

Elder Hunter:
Hm? Your weapon...

Young Hunter:
A noble tailored it for me after reforging your sword. From here on, I'll use it to protect our village.

Elder Hunter:
Oh... good swordsmanship. You've improved some.

Elder Hunter:
Do you know what it means to take on those responsibilities?

Elder Hunter:
You'll become a symbol to all the people, a mouthpiece of so-called protection, a personification of justice, so on. The one thing not included is you yourself.

Elder Hunter:
Your life'll be a hundred times more painful than it used to be.

Elder Hunter:
And none of this was yours. And it shouldn't be yours either.

Elder Hunter:
Since I was young, I've been determined to become that. And I chose to give up in the end, while you just lifted the ideal from my hands midway. How long can you bear it?

Young Hunter:
I regret it a lot, Lanton. I should've talked with you sooner, shared in your feelings. And maybe, after we understood each other better, none of this would've turned out the way it has.

Young Hunter:
You ask me how long I can bear it. I'm going to try my hardest to avoid using the word 'bear.'

Young Hunter:
I'll strive to work hard with the others, and turn endurance into fondness, into enjoyment.

Young Hunter:
I don't know if I can do it, but I want to try.

Elder Hunter:
You want to say you'll do better than me.

Young Hunter:
There's no reason to compare the two of us.

Elder Hunter:
......

Young Hunter:
......

Elder Hunter:
Drop dead.

Young Hunter:
I'm sorry.

Guard Operator:
Got them all tied up. That ought to put a bow on things.

Elder Hunter:
......

Elder Hunter:
So? What do you plan to do with me?

Young Hunter:
Lanton, are you really not going to change your mind?

Elder Hunter:
The moment I decided to do this, I became a different person.

Elder Hunter:
You can treat me like a stranger and off me. I love you, Landi, and that's the last thing I can do for you as your older brother.

Elder Hunter:
This whole month, I've done a lot of things I never did before. I've drawn a joy from it I never knew in the past twenty-something years.

Elder Hunter:
I may not be satisfied, but it's enough.

Young Hunter:
... (Unties)

Young Hunter:
Go, Lanton.

Elder Hunter:
......

Young Hunter:
The farther, the better.

Young Hunter:
Don't look back, don't come back, don't regret it.

Young Hunter:
Or else, I'll kill you.

Elder Hunter:
......

Young Hunter:
......

Young Hunter:
Lanton.

Young Hunter:
I'm sorry, Lanton.

Young Hunter:
If you looked back, I wouldn't have killed you.

Young Hunter:
But if I really did just let you go like this, so many more people would've died.

Elder Hunter:
It's how... it should be...

Blemishine:
......

Caster Operator:
He was in the right, Blemishine.

Blemishine:
I know...

Blemishine:
I know.

Blemishine:
I just never imagined, things could—reach this point, between family.

Young Hunter:
I'm sorry, Rhodes Islanders. I had to do this.

Caster Operator:
We understand.

Guard Operator:
Give him a proper burial.

Blemishine:
...I'll help you.

Young Hunter:
Lanton, this was the place you loved to train with your sword. I'll bury you here.

Young Hunter:
I don't know if I can become a militia chief as mighty as you were.

Young Hunter:
But I'll try my hardest.

Young Hunter:
I'm very thankful to all of you Rhodes Islanders. Without you, I really have no idea how things would've turned out.

Blemishine:
The militia are all waiting for you. You've truly become their new leader. Go say a few words to them.

Young Hunter:
Alright.

Young Hunter:
Listen up, everyone.

Young Hunter:
What my brother's done, I won't try to argue for him.

Young Hunter:
The man I was is a far cry from him, you could see that, and I know that much. I was lazy, idle, and didn't do what I should've.

Young Hunter:
But—I'm part of the village too.

Young Hunter:
It's my wish to see the village improve, to protect it.

Young Hunter:
From here on, in place of my brother, I'll take up the responsibility of protecting the village.

Young Hunter:
I hope you will all support me!

Militiaman A:
... (Clapping)

Militiaman B:
I wasn't convinced before, Landi, but I think I've come over today!

Militiaman A:
Landi, give it what you've got! I'll watch your back!

Blemishine:
......

Guard Operator:
Blemishine, what's up? Relief all over your face.

Blemishine:
I always had some lingering fears.

Blemishine:
I always thought me and my sister getting along was as natural as anything, and it would carry on just like that.

Blemishine:
But now I know. I've just been lucky enough...

Blemishine:
If at the time, I actually did fluke my way into winning the whole thing, and when Margaret came back, I'd turned into an outstanding competition knight—

Blemishine:
Would I have become her enemy, maybe?

Blemishine:
I have no idea.

Caster Operator:
Don't go thinking about it.

Blemishine:
I know, I know.

Blemishine:
