Weekend

Rhodes Island Cafeteria

Gitano:
And so, just like that—

Gitano:
And your cards naturally fall like water from one hand—

Gitano:
Into the other.

Young Studying Operator:
Wow!

Gitano:
Do you know how?

Young Studying Operator:
I still don't!!

Young Studying Operator:
Do it again, Gitano!

Gitano:
*clears throat* Now, watch carefully.

Young Studying Operator:
Okay—

Young Studying Operator:
Wow!

Gitano:
Do you understand now?

Young Studying Operator:
Nooope—

Gitano:
Really?

Gitano:
Regrettably, however, that's the end of today's cardistry lesson.

Young Studying Operator:
Awww—

Young Studying Operator:
How about one more time?

Gitano:
Then the person teaching here in a short while will be quite angry with me.

Gitano:
You wouldn't want to see me get castigated, would you?

Young Studying Operator:
Just one more, one little bit more? It'll be okay, right?

Gitano:
Rules are very important. You cannot let your desires lead you to willingly abandon them.

Gitano:
Hmm—

Gitano:
Such as it is, I'll give you all some homework.

Gitano:
If anyone can show us the fruits of their practice by next week's lesson...

Gitano:
Then—

Gitano:
You may draw one reward from the teacher's Treasure Chest.

Young Studying Operator:
The Treasure Chest?

Young Studying Operator:
Really?!

Gitano:
Really and truly. Just two days ago, your teacher even added something quite fun to it.

Gitano:
As long as you can summon the courage to give us all a display, everyone will get a share.

Young Studying Operator:
Yay!

Gitano:
Alright, class dismissed. Don't forget, keep your cards and toys safe with you.

Gitano:
We'll meet next week.

Young Studying Operator:
Bye, Miss!

Gitano:
Phew...

Croissant:
Phewie and a half. Breathe easy, miss. Lessons still runnin' slick?

Gitano:
You might get the impression they're lessons, but it's really just entertaining the children.

Gitano:
You have the greater burden.

Gitano:
It takes quite a lot of brainpower and effort, teaching children the rules of arithmetic.

Croissant:
Ain't no nightmare, really. Play numbers long 'nuff 'n they get it.

Croissant:
'n what I teach ain't no mathematics. Umm, what was that name I picked it?

Croissant:
'Business Fanatics Class?' Somethin' like that.

Croissant:
Aw, shucks, I'm just the same as you. Three cheers fer fun 'n none fer learnin'.

Gitano:
And that's quite good.

Gitano:
After all, it's a very cruel thing, doing business.

Croissant:
You get me, ma'am.

Gitano:
Though it was never originally intended as such, divination is also fundamentally a sort of business.

Croissant:
So it goes.

Gitano:
I'll let you set up the classroom in peace, then. Farewell.

Croissant:
Hrmmm—

Croissant:
Hm?

Croissant:
Oh, right!

Croissant:
Gitano, one second, please!

Gitano:
Do you need anything?

Croissant:
It's like this, see. Doctor seems fixin' ta head out far with Gavial, makin' fer a corner of Sargon.

Gitano:
Mm-hm.

Croissant:
And me, I'm gettin' ready to visit with, see if I can't do a li'l dealin' while I'm there.

Gitano:
Yes, I follow.

Croissant:
So I thought, uh. Y'see, uh. If you could juuuuust do me a li'l favor, gimme a tellin'?

Gitano:
You ought to know—

Croissant:
I know there is, yep, just, urm, how do I break this—

Croissant:
Spent all my money on gettin' stock in, ha, and now I ain't got a red cent on me.

Gitano:
*Sigh*.

Gitano:
I won't take any money as compensation.

Croissant:
Ya serious? That's mighty fine!

Gitano:
But I will need you to promise something.

Gitano:
You must promise me this—

Gitano:
You will not sell anything to the children during class.

Croissant:
?!

Gitano:
Not even if it's 'just snacks.'

Croissant:
Uh, haha.

Croissant:
Aw, heck, what makes you think I'd do somethin' like that?

Croissant:
Class might be a circus, but I still teach 'em proper.

Gitano:
You might, you might not. Neither has any bearing on me.

Gitano:
I simply need your promise, and that will be my price.

Croissant:
'n if I go back on it?

Gitano:
Who knows?

Croissant:
Hm...

Gitano:
What do you think?

Croissant:
Sold!

Gitano:
I have accepted your payment.

Croissant:
No need fer a... contract or somesuch?

Gitano:
Hmm?

Gitano:
Our agreement is built upon our trust in each other. We need no contract.

Croissant:
Huh.

Gitano:
In that case, let us begin.

Gitano:
Considering class is about to start, we'll employ a more simple divination method.

Gitano:
(Pulls out tarot deck)

Croissant:
Whoa, that's... some crafts, ain't it!

Croissant:
Feels like every card in there'd fetch big money.

Gitano:
......

Croissant:
Way you spread out 'n spin' 'em on the table, is that shufflin'?

Gitano:
Yes. Please wait a moment.

Croissant:
Could just shuffle 'em fancy in one shot, like you were teachin'.

Gitano:
Some diviners will do it like that, true.

Gitano:
But it's too harmful to the cards.

Gitano:
Just like the voyager pushing stubbornly through a blizzard: no matter how healthy, or how warm the clothes, their warmth is pulled away trace by trace in the end.

Gitano:
The moment warmth is lost, all remedy will be of avail no more.

Croissant:
Ahaha...

Gitano:
Just a comparison Sami tend to use fairly often. I imagine you comprehend it.

Croissant:
Yup, yup, I getcha.

Gitano:
......

Croissant:
All ready now?

Gitano:
Mm. They're ready. They should be able to shine a light for you on some of your conundrums.

Gitano:
Gather them together, cut them once, and starting from where you've cut them, lay down three cards.

Gitano:
Remember, do not turn them over yet.

Croissant:
So ya don't actually do a darn thing, Gitano?

Gitano:
I'm merely your guide in understanding. Shouldn't you uncover your own fate?

Gitano:
Or, perhaps, you're easily willing to lay your fate in others' hands?

Croissant:
Alrght, I get it now. Lemme at 'em!

Croissant:
Stack 'em up... cut... lay three cards face down in front.

Croissant:
That oughta be good, right?

Gitano:
Your movements are very direct. It seems you are not adrift.

Croissant:
Darn tootin'.

Gitano:
Well, then. Please.

Gitano:
Turn a card however you wish.

Croissant:
Ya been so dead serious all this time. Got some pressure on me.

Gitano:
There's nothing to be scared of. Come.

Gitano:
Reveal your first card.

Croissant:
(Flips card)

Gitano:
The Knight of Cups, Reversed.

Croissant:
Ya gotta fill me in. Does forward or backward matter anythin'?

Gitano:
To put it simply, reversed cards symbolize that you are currently hindered by something.

Croissant:
Huh?!

Gitano:
Relax. These hindrances are not necessarily bad in meaning.

Gitano:
They simply mean that right now, you are unable to successfully proceed.

Gitano:
Breakthrough, and success, perhaps aren't too far away.

Croissant:
Gotcha.

Gitano:
Let me look carefully.

Gitano:
Have you run into any problems doing business?

Croissant:
Uh, suppose I have.

Croissant:
That's how it goes more or less every month. Sometimes I blunder decidin', 'n then I don't earn nothin.' Pain in my keister.

Gitano:
You've probably seen an opportunity, but failed to grasp it.

Croissant:
That's the story of anyone doin' business any day of the week.

Gitano:
So this time, you've prepared to stake it all?

Croissant:
I trust my intuition. Headin' to Gavial's ol' place is gonna pay off big!

Gitano:
I see.

Gitano:
By my understanding, Rhodes Island's procurement services have always been short of hands. As long as you're willing to help them with some work, money won't be a problem, and most risk will be shouldered by Rhodes Island instead.

Gitano:
Why choose to go it alone?

Croissant:
That, huh.

Croissant:
Used to workin' by myself.

Gitano:
It seems your decisions are not wholly profit-seeking.

Croissant:
Ain't as grand as ya put it, neither. Just seein' the world fer myself, makin' some money on the side to patch up expenses.

Croissant:
Always gotta spend money fer the good stuff, after all.

Gitano:
I understand.

Croissant:
So this, uh, this here card, basically, it ain't no good sign.

Gitano:
Coming events will not be smooth.

Croissant:
So can I just—Gitano—ya gotta teach me!

Gitano:
Don't rush. This is merely a beginning.

Gitano:
Come. Reveal your second card.

Croissant:
D'awwwgh, alright...

Croissant:
(Shakes as she flips a card)

Gitano:
The Ace of Wands, Upright.

Croissant:
Wh... what's this one mean...?

Gitano:
You have seized an opportunity, and are about to receive an advantage in life from it.

Gitano:
Though there may be great danger, you have issued your challenge to life with full conviction.

Croissant:
Sounds like a good thing.

Gitano:
When I divined for myself, I once came to this one too.

Croissant:
Whoa—y'all can even do divination fer yerselves?

Gitano:
When a flash of miraculous light strikes, diviners are utterly capable of peering into their own paths.

Croissant:
'n here I thought diviners only took money 'n did stuff fer other folk.

Gitano:
Ultimately, currency cannot settle all questions.

Gitano:
Moreover, there are some paths outsiders have no recourse to interfere in. Only by conversing with themselves, feeling through things, pursuing, can they grasp a chance at a clue.

Croissant:
Gets pretty darn complicated, then.

Gitano:
It's just like how you choose to conduct business by yourself, Croissant. All your decisions, any of your choices, they're all crystallizations of your years of business experience, aren't they?

Gitano:
Others can only give suggestions. The power to decide lies eternally in your own hand—just as it does now.

Gitano:
Even if all three cards portended the worst outcome, would you really change your decisions?

Croissant:
Money's spent...

Gitano:
So you've only come seeking a comfort of sorts, hoping I might give you reassuring results.

Gitano:
Ah—no need to answer me. Many are like that. I understand it very well.

Gitano:
All of us will tend to hope for something unrealistic in uncertain times, something that'll resolve it all.

Gitano:
Unfortunately, I'm not what you've all been hoping for.

Gitano:
All I can do is peer shallow into the road ahead, and offer all the help I can.

Gitano:
You've paid my terms, and so I have a responsibility to spare no effort for you.

Gitano:
Only this, and nothing more.

Croissant:
Gitano...

Gitano:
Let us continue.

Croissant:
Al... Alrighty.

Gitano:
You will have an adventure, but it seems your journey won't be serene.

Gitano:
As for the outcome, we may look to the last card to show our answer.

Gitano:
I can't say whether there'll even be a single note of LMD at the end.

Croissant:
It just keeps gettin' more dangerous...

Gitano:
I only bring up a poorer kind of possibility.

Gitano:
Returning with overflowing riches is not out of possibility's realm, either.

Croissant:
Gosh, could ya imagine?

Gitano:
I'll be visiting Perfumer's sometime for a complete course of aromatic sleep therapy, then.

Gitano:
I'll leave the bill to you.

Croissant:
I make some cash 'n I'll cover ya!

Gitano:
Hm-hmm. It's a done deal.

Gitano:
Now, then, let us explore your destination in this journey.

Gitano:
Your final card, please.

Croissant:
(Flips tarot card with a swish)

Gitano:
The Moons, Upright.

Croissant:
So it's upright. 'kay, good start.

Gitano:
This is... certainly hard to say.

Gitano:
Have... you ever looked into Gavial's hometown situation before?

Croissant:
I've surveyed Sargon markets before. This stuff'll sell like hotcakes!

Gitano:
If so, that'll be the best outcome.

Gitano:
(Is there any possibility it won't be an ordinary Sargon market, I wonder...)

Gitano:
(The Moons upright...)

Gitano:
Your journey will not be serene. The fore cards tell of that much.

Gitano:
Be wary of deception, and wary of being cheated.

Gitano:
In my view, if possible, do proceed cautiously.

Gitano:
Do you like the moons?

Croissant:
Like? Can't say I do fer sure? But when I'm moody out on the deck 'n look up 'n see the moons, that makes me feel alright some.

Gitano:
And the moonshadow?

Croissant:
Umm. Do folk specifically go lookin' fer the shadow?

Gitano:
Under the radiance of the moon, things often come to be ignored.

Gitano:
The things this card shows are also as such.

Gitano:
There is always that which is hidden by radiance, painstakingly concealed.

Gitano:
Whether it is fortune or sorrow requires your own careful consideration.

Croissant:
Noted. I'll be watchin' out.

Gitano:
And this should be what these cards have shown.

Gitano:
What these three cards together make known to you.

Gitano:
Croissant, your future will not be relaxed.

Gitano:
At the least, accompanying the Doctor on this journey out, there will be many hindrances.

Gitano:
Do you have any such feeling of your own? For example, a vague unease or confusion in your heart.

Croissant:
Kinda a li'l bit...

Croissant:
But push past, 'n I should be able to get over it.

Croissant:
Do the, uh, cards say I'm gonna lose my investment?

Gitano:
Not at all. Besides, the tarot never speaks in certainties of futures.

Croissant:
So, still a chance I'm saved.

Croissant:
If I can't hold out, I oughta last 'nother couple days knockin' on my savin's jar.

Gitano:
Here's hoping.

Gitano:
As for divining, things would wrap up here.

Gitano:
Is there anything else you need me for?

Croissant:
Hmm...

Croissant:
Gitano, you pull a card too!

Gitano:
Oh?

Croissant:
Didn'tcha just say diviners can divine themselves too?

Croissant:
I wanna see how yer luck is.

Gitano:
But that requires me to prepare—

Croissant:
C'mon, lessee.

Gitano:
The tarot is not—

Croissant:
Aw, potayto potahto, c'mon. Draw.

Croissant:
(Draws a card 'for' Gitano.)

Gitano:
!

Croissant:
Come on. Flip it.

Gitano:
Wait. Let me prepare a moment.

Gitano:
——

Gitano:
Phew.

Gitano:
(Flips tarot card)

Gitano:
Ten of Cups... Reversed...

Croissant:
This mean somethin' bad?

Gitano:
......

Croissant:
Then lemme just turn it round—

Gitano:
Stay your hand and do not touch the card!

Croissant:
Oh, alright...

Croissant:
......

Croissant:
Sorry, Gitano.

Gitano:
No.

Croissant:
?

Gitano:
That's not it.

Gitano:
The card's position is in relation to the revealer.

Gitano:
So this card.

Gitano:
Is Upright.

Croissant:
Hmm?

Croissant:
Ohh...

Croissant:
Right! Yer sittin' opposite me!!

Croissant:
So this card mean somethin' good, then?

Gitano:
In regards to my occupation and personal relations, it's not bad at all.

Croissant:
Then—

Croissant:
(Grabs Gitano's hand and rubs it a few times)

Gitano:
Eh?

Croissant:
Lemme borrow a li'l bit of yer good luck, a'ight? This way I can pay ya back.

Gitano:
If you so insist...

Gitano:
As you wish, then...

Croissant:
Hoooo boy, yer gonna let me pay you back sure as sweeeeeet heck.

Croissant:
Ah!

Gitano:
What's wrong?

Croissant:
I just thoughta somethin'!

Croissant:
If I'm borrowin' yer good luck, don't that mean the whole divination we just did don't count fer nothin' now?

Gitano:
Who knows?

Croissant:
So there ain't no rule like that, huh.

Gitano:
If you want another divination, you will have to make a payment to me again.

Croissant:
Uh, yup. Pass, then.

Croissant:
Hmm...

Croissant:
Lemme rub a few more times. That oughta be free, right?

Gitano:
Hm-hmm~

Gitano:
I'll give you a discount on this one. Free it is.

Croissant:
Aw, thanks!

Five minutes later...

Young Studying Operator:
Hi, Croissant!!

Young Studying Operator:
It's nice to meet you too, Gitano!

Croissant:
Oooh.

Gitano:
Good day, all.

Gitano:
Well, then. I'll be leaving now.

Gitano:
I pray the LMD you earn will be enough to cram Rhodes Island full.

Croissant:
You got it.

Croissant:
Next time ya got stuff to buy, remember, you find me. I'll give ya some deep discounts!

Gitano:
Fate is a thing of constant change. We'll talk details when the time is right.

Gitano:
(Waves and leaves)

Gitano:
(I hope my fortune can truly be of help to you, Croissant.)
