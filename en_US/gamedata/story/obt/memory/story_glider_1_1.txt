Campbell:
Really? Oripathy doesn't pass from the Infected to healthy people?

Honeyberry:
Regular contact with Oripathy patients in stable conditions does not transmit Oripathy.

Campbell:
But how do I know if someone is infected or not?

Honeyberry:
I've contacted the nearest Rhodes Island office. They'll be sending test kits soon—

Campbell:
Just go home, kid, and tell your family to move as soon as you can.

Campbell:
People are afraid that your dad will pass Oripathy onto other people. We can't afford that.

Honeyberry:
Please, Mrs. Samantha, patients who are in stable conditions are not infectious.

Samantha:
How can you prove that?

Honeyberry:
I come from Rhodes Island, where the Infected and non-Infected live together. Infection is not a problem, as long as the progress of Oripathy is monitored regularly.

Samantha:
Don't play with that girl, Molly! They've got an Infected at home! You'll get the stone disease!

Samantha's Daughter:
Stone disease?

Samantha:
A disease where you grow rocks from your body! It hurts so much you die from the pain alone!

Sandwheel:
Water, Honeyberry?

Honeyberry:
Thanks.

Sandwheel:
You spent all morning talking. Did they listen?

Honeyberry:
They will. As long as they can let go of their prejudice, there won't be any issues with the Infected here. And I won't need to be here.

Sandwheel:
You're so patient with them.

Sandwheel:
If my own family was chased out, there's no way I'd set aside the grudge and come back to help them with their Infected problem, no matter how many years had passed.

Honeyberry:
It's... not that I've set it aside.

Honeyberry:
The issue with Dad, I can understand. Hard not to panic when there's an Infected so close to you.

Honeyberry:
But the thing with Mum, I could never...

Honeyberry:
I came because I want them to set their prejudices aside. I don't want another tragedy like mine to happen.

Martenson:
No!

Martenson:
My son's going to be a mining company manager! I can't have him living with the Infected!

Martenson's Mother:
My son's joining the mining company! I can't have him live and eat with you people!

Martenson's Mother:
Scram! Get out, while we're still asking nicely!

Honeyberry:
......

Martenson:
We asked you to solve our Infected problem, not to preach at us!

Martenson:
We're an important supply point for the mining company! How are we supposed to do business with those Infected making a mess every few days?

Honeyberry:
I understand, I do.

Honeyberry:
But think of it this way: the Infected won't do that if everyone's getting along, right?

Martenson:
Says you! Their ringleader only came back to cause trouble because he realized he could use Originium Arts. He's a lunatic with rocks growing out of his brain!

Honeyberry:
Why you—

Sandwheel:
We should go, Honeyberry.

Honeyberry:
Right... okay.

Honeyberry:
Looks like two-fifths are willing to listen, two-fifths are undecided, and the last fifth is strongly opposed.

Sandwheel:
So what's our next move?

Honeyberry:
I think it's worth getting everyone together to talk this out.

Sandwheel:
To be honest, the people you've categorized as 'willing to listen' seem pretty undecided to me.

Sandwheel:
Maybe you could reveal your identity? None of them recognized you. Maybe they'll be willing to side with you for old times' sake? Or even out of guilt.

Honeyberry:
I... don't want to do that.

Sandwheel:
Sorry.

Honeyberry:
But if the villagers really are as stubborn as you say...

Honeyberry:
Anyway, let's get them together.

Honeyberry:
...The Infected and non-Infected can live together as long as there are proper identification, testing, and protection procedures in place.

Martenson:
Wait, it's you!

Martenson:
What are <i>you</i> doing here? Get out! You're not welcome here!

Fierce Infected:
This is my home too. Who do you think you are?

Fierce Infected:
So what's this all about? Some kinda meeting? Trying to run more Infected out of town? Hey, who the heck are you?

Honeyberry:
I'm Operator Honeyberry, from Rhodes Island—

Fierce Infected:
Rhodes Island? What's that? Did the mining company send you?

Honeyberry:
We did come at the mining company's request, but we're not taking a side here. We just want to get the problem resolved.

Fierce Infected:
Yeah right! You're just the company's hounds!

Fierce Infected:
You're coming with me! Let's see what you're plotting!

Sandwheel tries to get to Honeyberry, but she waves him off.

Honeyberry:
Suits me just fine. I was going to visit you anyway.

Fierce Infected:
Ha, got a big mouth on you.

Samantha:
Gus, she's a guest. Show some respect—

Samantha:
Eek!

Gus:
Who's the one who needs to show respect here, huh?

Gus:
Anyone who dares stand in my way gets it to the head!

Gus:
We're here.

Honeyberry:
(This is...)

Gus:
Now spill it! Why'd they send you?!

Honeyberry:
......

Gus:
What's the matter? You seemed pretty chatty back in the village.

Honeyberry:
How did you find this place?

Gus:
We had nowhere to go, and no one was living here. Why wouldn't we?

Honeyberry:
The first Infected from the village used to live here with his wife and kid.

Gus:
Don't you try to change the subject with old stories or whatever.

Honeyberry:
I was telling the truth back there. I came to help solve your problems, Gus.

Gus:
Solve my problems? How? I told them the rocks appeared on their own without catching it from anyone, but did they believe me?

Honeyberry:
That's why I'm promoting knowledge about proper Oripathy prevention and treatment, so that you can go back to the village.

Two figures emerge from the shadows.

Infected A:
Is that for real?

Infected B:
We can go back to the village?

Gus:
Quiet! Stay outta this!

Infected A:
But she said—

Gus:
How do you know she's not lying?

Honeyberry:
I was telling the truth.

Honeyberry:
And where's your sister, Gus?

Gus:
H-How did you know I had a sister?

Honeyberry:
......

Gus:
Argh, whatever.

Gus:
Lydia's in her room.

Honeyberry:
Hello, Lydia. Are you there?

Lydia:
Who's that? Another exile from the village? How is Carl?

Honeyberry:
I'm Operator Honeyberry, from Rhodes Island. I'm here to help.

Lydia:
Hello, Honeyberry—

Lydia:
Wait, no— *cough* You're—

Lydia:
Is it really you?! Zoey Perris?!

Honeyberry:
Lydia... you...

Honeyberry:
Yes, we used to play together all the time. Even if the rest of the village forgot about me, you never...

Lydia:
Of course I'd never forget my best mate... *cough*, *cough*

Lydia:
What about Mr. and Mrs. Perris? Did they go to Rhodes Island with you?

Honeyberry:
Mum's living with me on Rhodes Island. Dad passed away soon after he was chased out.

Lydia:
...I'm sorry.

Honeyberry:
It's okay. I still remember how you used to bring us stuff after we were exiled.

Lydia:
But after Grandpa found out...

Honeyberry:
Let's talk about you first. You don't look too good...

Lydia:
(Shakes head)

Lydia:
I've been feeling ill ever since I was exiled. Colds, headaches, occasional vomiting...

Honeyberry:
(Could Lydia be like Mum...?)

Honeyberry:
Let me do a quick checkup.

Honeyberry:
The quick test strips show an extremely low chance that you have Oripathy. I didn't see signs of any organic diseases either.

Honeyberry:
No Originium crystals on the body surface... I'll check with more precise equipment.

Honeyberry:
The results show you don't have Oripathy.

Lydia:
I see...

Honeyberry:
(She doesn't seem happy about it...)

Honeyberry:
Can I ask you something? Have you felt stressed lately?

Lydia:
...No.

Honeyberry:
Are you sure?

Lydia:
There's just someone in the village I'm concerned about...

Honeyberry:
(Someone in the village? Is it the name she said before she recognized me?)

Honeyberry:
Carl? Mr. Martenson's son?

Her childhood friend looks at her with a shocked expression, then tears begin flowing from her eyes.

Lydia:
Carl and I were going to tell Mr. Martenson about our relationship and get engaged. And then Gus got sick.

Lydia:
Carl and I had been looking forward to it and preparing for so long... and then...

Lydia:
......

Honeyberry:
Lydia...

Lydia:
I might never see him again. When I think about that, I...

Lydia:
Ugh—

Lydia:
Zoey, I'm feeling sick... I think I might throw up. Stay away...

Honeyberry:
Why would you say that?!

Honeyberry:
Gus, Gus! Are you there?

Gus:
What's going on?

Honeyberry:
See if there's a kind of grass in the garden that's about the height of a human palm, with slightly red-tipped leaves growing in opposing pairs!

Gus:
Let me see... yeah. What about it?

Honeyberry:
Grab a few of them! Lydia's about to throw up, and that's a herb that can help.

Gus:
What? I'll get right on it!

Honeyberry:
How do you feel?

Lydia:
Zoey... much better. Thank you.

Honeyberry:
This is just for emergencies, though.

Honeyberry:
Whether it's some kind of organic disease I've never heard of, or the result of psychological factors, the herb will only alleviate the symptoms, not the cause.

Honeyberry:
My mum was in a situation just like yours. She got much better after the psychological problems went away.

Lydia:
And how'd she do that?

Honeyberry:
I grew up and reduced the burden on her. She didn't have to worry about tomorrow's bread, and our situation got better as well, so she got better on her own.

Lydia:
The villagers see me as the family of an Infected. Gus is afraid they'll hurt me, and I... I'm like this.

Lydia:
I don't care if I'm infected, and I don't care what they think. All I want is to see Carl again... one more time...

Honeyberry:
......

Honeyberry:
I have an idea.

Honeyberry:
I know of a herb that grows around here that can give you a fever, without seriously threatening your health.

Gus:
What's going on? Why does Lydia have a fever?!

Honeyberry:
The reason isn't important right now. What's important is that Lydia wants to go back to the village.

Gus:
I know that! How many times do you think she's told me?! It's always Carl this, Carl that! He's such a fraud!

Gus:
He's not even showing his face at a time like this! That tells me all I need to know.

Honeyberry:
Lydia's feelings are real, though. Otherwise she wouldn't be so ill.

Honeyberry:
No matter how much you hate Carl and the villagers, think of your sister. It's not Oripathy she has, it's an illness of the mind!

Gus:
The mind...

Honeyberry:
If you're really worried about her, let her go back. I can guarantee that the villagers won't harm her.

Gus:
So... what? She sees that fraud and gets better. What then?

Gus:
The village will never accept her, and it's not like Carl would ever come live with us. She'll still suffer in the end!

Honeyberry:
So you're just going to watch her suffer from the fever she's got right now?

Gus:
......

Lydia's Grandfather:
Perris, the whole village will be destroyed if your Oripathy spreads.

Honeyberry's Father:
But my wife and daughter are healthy! They don't have any stones on them!

Lydia's Grandfather:
Better safe than sorry. It's all for the village, you know.

Honeyberry:
Gus, I came here to dispel the village's fear, and the prejudices you have of each other.

Honeyberry:
Sure, some rejected me, but others were willing to listen.

Honeyberry:
Just try it. For yourself, for Lydia, and for them.

Gus:
......

Gus:
I can see you mean what you're saying, but I still don't believe those bastards can actually let go of their prejudices.

Honeyberry:
You mean...

Gus:
You can try, but on one condition.

Gus:
Most of the villagers don't know about Lydia and Carl. Martenson is only thinking about his son's career, and he sure as hell wasn't gonna go around and tell people about it.

Gus:
You're not allowed to bring up Carl's name in the village. I want to see him step up on his own.

Gus:
Otherwise, he'd only do it because he didn't have a choice.

Campbell:
Honeyberry, you're back—wait, why did you bring—

Honeyberry:
Don't worry, Mrs. Campbell. Infected in stable condition are not contagious.

Honeyberry:
Lydia is living proof. She's been staying with the Infected for so long, but she never caught Oripathy.

Campbell:
Really? But why does she look so sickly then?

Honeyberry:
Ah... that's why we came back. Let's just say that she's lovesick.

Campbell:
Lovesick? Now this I need to hear.

Campbell:
Aha. So <i>that's</i> what this is about.

Campbell:
Now why the heck didn't you let your sister come back and see her boyfriend, Gus?

Gus:
It was you people who—

Honeyberry:
Gus had his own troubles to deal with, ma'am. No one knew where the Oripathy came from, did they?

Campbell:
So, who's the lucky young man who caught Lydia's eye?

Honeyberry:
Sorry, I've got a non-disclosure agreement with Gus.

Campbell:
How could you do that, Gus?

Honeyberry:
Don't blame him. It's natural for him to be a little resentful after his exile from the village.

Honeyberry:
Besides, there's no real point if the young man isn't willing to step forward of his own accord, is there?

Campbell:
You've got me there. Alright, I'll get everyone.

Honeyberry:
(Whisper) Is Carl here, Lydia? I don't remember how he looks.

Lydia:
......

Still with a fever, Lydia bites her lip while casting her gaze towards a young man in a corner.

He stands beside Martenson, looking slightly timid. His father's eyes are wary as they meet Honeyberry's.

Honeyberry:
...Step forward, if you still love her.

The crowd whispers amongst themselves. Some parents ask their children, while others ask Martenson, who shakes his head furiously.

Carl stands behind his father, his expression hidden from view.

Honeyberry:
The sickness of your beloved isn't because of Oripathy. It's because she misses you.

Honeyberry:
She insisted on coming back to see you. Please, step forward!

Martenson starts getting impatient and turns to leave, while Carl seems to be nailed to the ground.

Martenson:
Oripathy has fried the girl's brain. Get her out of here!

Honeyberry thought she would hear objections from the crowd, but there were none.

Honeyberry:
Guys...

Honeyberry:
I...

Honeyberry:
What are you afraid of?

Gus:
Don't bother, Honeyberry. They won't listen.

Honeyberry:
No! I have to speak up!

Honeyberry:
The kids all love Mrs. Campbell because she always makes biscuits for them.

Honeyberry:
Mrs. Samantha doesn't trust people easily, but when she does, she always stands up for them.

Honeyberry:
The Martenson family works hard to live a better life, without forgetting to help out their neighbors.

Honeyberry:
This village is full of good people. What kind of deep, heavy—<i>evil</i> fear could make you all so heartless and cruel?

Lydia:
...That's enough, Zoey.

Honeyberry:
Lydia?

Honeyberry:
But you haven't seen your boyfriend yet.

Lydia:
(Smiles meekly)

Lydia:
I saw him. I did.

Honeyberry:
But...

Lydia:
He heard you scold everyone, and he stayed here in opposition to his family's wishes... The important thing is that I saw him, and he saw me.

Lydia:
I know he loves me. He just can't... I don't blame him. How can I?

Lydia:
It's enough, Zoey. I'm happy enough.

Lydia:
I don't want to make his life difficult, even if I'm not Infected.

Lydia:
We...

Lydia:
We—

Lydia:
(Sobs)

Lydia:
Let's go...

Martenson:
Carl?! Are you out of your mind? Where are you going?

Carl hugs the weakened Lydia in his arms.

Carl:
I swear I won't ever leave you again, Lydia.

Lydia:
Am... am I dreaming, Carl? It's a dream, right?

Carl:
No, it's not a dream!

Carl:
I almost lost you once. No one will ever keep us apart again!

Honeyberry:
(Rubs eyes)

Honeyberry:
You see, Gus? Just like I said.

Gus:
Carl...

Honeyberry casts her gaze at the crowd and feels her heart sink.

Campbell is wiping tears from her eyes, but not many others are rejoicing for the young lovers.

More prevalent are expressions of hesitation, doubt, and fear.

Honeyberry:
Excuse me...

Honeyberry feels a chill run down her back at the cold reaction of the crowd.

Honeyberry:
Will you accept Lydia back into the village?

She said 'Lydia' rather than 'the Infected,' without even realizing it.

A moment of silence passes.

Finally, someone opens his mouth.

Martenson:
Think about it carefully, Carl.

Martenson:
Go with her, and you can never come back.

Honeyberry:
What?!

Martenson:
It can't be helped.

Honeyberry feels a daze come over her.

Honeyberry:
Wh-What are you talking about? So many years have passed. Haven't we proven ourselves healthy by now?

Lydia's Grandfather:
People are afraid, Zoey.

Honeyberry:
What are they afraid of?

Honeyberry:
They forced dad out! He's not around anymore! Mum and I have lived in the forest for so many years! What makes them so afraid that we can't even set foot in the village?

Lydia's Grandfather:
It can't be helped.

Honeyberry:
It can't be helped? Is that your final answer?

Samantha:
Better safe than sorry, after all.

Samantha:
How about this: I won't try to get Gus to pay for all the stuff he broke and all the lost business. We'll just leave each other alone going forward.

Samantha:
That way, he won't come and cause any more trouble, right?

Samantha:
Just have them go back. Once they're gone, the village will owe you a feast. Everyone appreciates how you took care of the problem.

Honeyberry:
But I've already said that Oripathy patients in stable condition aren't—

Samantha:
Just let it go, okay? Who knows who's Infected or not when they're not growing any rocks?

Honeyberry:
Rhodes Island is sending over equipment for Oripathy screening and testing, and our staff will be teaching people how to use it. Isn't that enough to dispel your fear?

Samantha:
That... that's in the future. What if there's a delay? What if there's an equipment error?

Samantha:
Just let it go, and let them go. I'll make you my special—

Honeyberry:
Mille-feuille.

Samantha:
?!

Honeyberry:
Mrs. Samantha, I...

Honeyberry:
I'm Zoey Perris.

A commotion spreads through the crowd.

Samantha:
Perris... You're Perris's girl, Zoey? You're not Infected?

Honeyberry:
Like I said, Oripathy is not transmissible the way the flu is. Plus, Dad—

Martenson:
Get out! The children of the Infected are not welcome here!

Campbell:
What are you talking about, Martenson?

Martenson:
Perris was the first Infected in the village! How could we let his daughter in here?

Campbell:
Didn't she just say that Oripathy isn't transmitted like that?

Martenson:
Can she say for sure? Is she the one who'll have to pay the price if we have new Infected?

Frightened Crowd:
Yeah, yeah!

Honeyberry:
I—

Honeyberry feels a lump in her throat and could say no more.

Martenson's attitude is harsh and stern, but Honeyberry sees only fear in his eyes.

The same fear that they had cast towards her family.

She looks around at Samantha, at the others, and sees the same in their eyes.

Sandwheel:
Honeyberry.

Honeyberry:
...Sandwheel?

Sandwheel:
Don't forget what we're here for.

Sandwheel:
We're not here to promote proper Oripathy prevention and treatment, nor are we here to dispel their prejudices.

Sandwheel:
We're just here to resolve the Infected problem.

Sandwheel:
You've done what you could. Leave the rest to the operators delivering the equipment.

Sandwheel:
Our job now is to worry about Gus's group, and that pair of lovers.

Sandwheel:
Feeling better?

Honeyberry:
(Blows nose)

Sandwheel:
Think about happier things.

Honeyberry:
Happier things?

Sandwheel:
Like about how Rhodes Island is opening an office in the nearest Rim Billiton nomadic city, and how they'll need new staff to run it.

Honeyberry:
...Yes, we're lucky that Gus and the other two Infected have somewhere to go.

Sandwheel:
Lydia is recovering quickly, and she and Carl are applying to a mining company branch in the city. Isn't that something to be happy about?

Honeyberry:
Yeah...

Honeyberry:
......

Honeyberry:
Now I'm realizing that the village never changed.

Honeyberry:
Not once, from the day they ran out our family, to the day Dad passed away, to the day I came to Rhodes Island with Mum, and all the way till today.

Sandwheel:
Most villages that small never change. That one just happens to lie on the supply route for a new Originium mine.

Honeyberry:
But this event... could it be the catalyst for change in the future?

Sandwheel:
Mind if I said something that you might not like to hear?

Honeyberry:
Go ahead.

Sandwheel:
Change was inevitable the moment ore deposits were found in the area.

Sandwheel:
The village has to either change, or perish.

Sandwheel:
You were still willing to come back and help them. That alone ought to push them to set aside old prejudices and fears.

Honeyberry:
I'm jumping, Mint!

Mint:
Alright, I'm down here for you—

Honeyberry:
Phew.

Mint:
I was really worried when you came back from that field mission looking like a different person.

Honeyberry:
Just had a little bit of a shock. Got over it real quick, though.

Mint:
By the way, there was a letter for you yesterday. The Messenger left it with me when they couldn't find you.

Honeyberry:
From where?

Mint:
Rim Billiton. Here.

Mint:
I'm off for training. Feel free to join me after you read it.

Honeyberry:
Sure!

Dear Zoey,

How are you doing?

Carl and I both applied to the mining company. Guess who got hired?

Both of us! I couldn't believe it!

We celebrated by having a nice meal out. Carl chose a Siracusan restaurant, and it was really good. We'll take you there next time you're here.

We both went through the entrance physical, and showed no trace of Oripathy. I've fully recovered from my symptoms too.

Thank you so much for your help.

Give your mum my regards!

Your dearest Lydia

P.S.: Carl's dad came to see him and brought him some food from home.

He said that the arguments went on for days after the Rhodes Island operators brought the Oripathy screening equipment and trained people how to use it.

In the end, they're letting the Infected and their families live near the village. They don't have to stay in the forest anymore.

He asked whether we wanted to go back, but Carl turned him down.

Even if Carl said yes, though, I wouldn't go back. I won't ever go back.

Honeyberry:
......

Honeyberry:
I guess I don't have to go back anymore.

Honeyberry:
They've taken the first step. They'll put their prejudices aside.

Honeyberry:
They will.
