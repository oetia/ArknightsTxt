Village on the Ursus outskirts

Shura:
*Gulp* Ah! This is some good beer. Fresh and smooth.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Ahem... Miss Shura...

Shura:
Why the long face, boss? The beer here's made with local honey. It's great!

Shura:
Plus, you're leaving tomorrow, and this is my last day working for you. Have one on me!

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Absolutely not. I like to keep a balanced diet. I'm not in the habit of finishing a whole can of honey in the middle of the night, then binging sweetened booze the next day.

Shura:
You were the one who said I could help myself to what's in the fridge!

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Yeah, but, you know, within reason...

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Don't you worry about your health?

Shura:
Being a bodyguard is hard work. Need the fat and the sugar to get enough energy.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Like I said, 'within reason'!

Shura:
Haha, gotcha, boss.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Sigh...

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Say, I wanted to ask, do you have any plans after this job is over?

Shura:
(Scratches head) I've thought about it, but I haven't come up with an answer.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Actually, I wanted to talk to you—

Waiter:
Promotion on freshly-brewed honey beer! Buy one, get one free!

Shura:
I'll have another!

Waiter:
One special honey beer, coming right up!

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
—about this.

Shura:
Did you say something? Couldn't hear.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
*sigh*...

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
I can't stay any longer, Shura, but there's something important that I want to tell you. This is no place to talk.

Shura:
Of course, boss. With you all the way.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
You... huh? What's that...?

Shura:
Why aren't you moving? Aren't you in a hurry?

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Am I seeing things, Shura? Looks like there's someone running towards us.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
He's heading straight for you! Darn it, I knew the agent was lying when he said your background was clean!

Shura:
Wait a minute! I told you, all I did was underground boxing. I've never been in the mob!

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Really? That man looks like he's pretty eager to talk to you.

Shura:
Er... well, actually, I do know him. Relax, just get behind me.

Muscular Man:
Well, if it isn't our boxing champion.

Shura:
Get out of the way, Yevgeny. I don't have time for you right now.

Muscular Man:
You quit boxing to become a bodyguard? Oh, I forgot, you're not a champion anymore.

Shura:
Only an ass like you would celebrate a champion belt won for free.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Shura...

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
(It's like she's a completely different person.)

Muscular Man:
It wouldn't have been hard to take the belt from a rookie like you.

Shura:
Oh yeah? Maybe you won't talk so loud with your nose snapped in half.

Shura:
You think you would be running your mouth like this if I didn't get ambushed the day before the match?

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Say, you...

Muscular Man:
Stop making excuses. It won't change the fact that you never showed up to the match.

Shura:
You have no shame, do you, asshole?

Muscular Man:
Oh, mad now? What would the old man think, I wonder, if he knew that his finest student was licking boots as a bodyguard?

Shura:
Don't you dare mention my coach!

Muscular Man:
Ooh, getting all puffed up in the cheeks, eh? Should we take this outside?

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
That's enough!

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Shura, I don't care what grudge you have against him, but your time doesn't belong to you. It belongs to the one paying your fee, in other words, me!

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
So please don't waste your time and my money on... er... THAT.

Muscular Man:
Huh? Um, yeah, listen to boss girl and run away with your tail between your legs!

Shura:
Huh? Isn't our work done already, boss?

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
The work's done, but you're still on duty. I paid you for eight full hours. Let's go, Shura.

Shura:
Alright... can't argue with the contract.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Plus, look at the waiters. They clearly don't want you fighting here.

Shura:
Eh, well, yeah.

Muscular Man:
If you aren't gonna fight, Olav, I'm outta here. I'm a busy guy, unlike you.

Shura:
If you had the slightest backbone, you wouldn't be showing off your cheap belt.

Shura:
Let's finish that fight and let the outcome do the talking.

Shura:
But not now. I'll come for you later. I know where to find you.

Muscular Man:
I bet you're just gonna disappear like last time.

Shura:
Oh? Getting cold feet, Mr. Champion?

Muscular Man:
O-Of course not! Bring it on, if you dare... I, I'm not scared of you!

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
ARE YOU DONE TALKING YET?

Muscular Man:
Why you suk—!

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Let's go, Shura. We're too busy for... THAT.

Shura:
Gotta go, Yevgeny. See you tonight. You'd better be there.

Muscular Man:
'That'? What does she mean by 'that'?

6:34 PM \ Cloudy

Shura:
So why did you drag me back like this?

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Remember what I told you about Rhodes Island?

Shura:
It's a medicine company, right? The place you work at? You brought it up a bunch of times.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Are you going to keep working as a bodyguard after this job?

Shura:
Who knows? I guess. It's not like people like me have much of a choice.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Well, Rhodes Island is hiring, and I bet you have the skills for the job. I'm thinking of putting in a good word for you with HR.

Shura:
Really? Gosh... thanks, boss.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Plus, it'll only get harder and harder to hide your condition. Even though the authorities are lax out here, things will only get worse if you stay.

Shura:
Sheesh, didn't know you cared about me that much... but is it really okay? You know most places don't tend to hire folks like me, you know, the Infected.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Don't say that. In fact, you're exactly the kind of person we're looking for. Rhodes Island has been striving to make the world better for people like you... people like us.

Shura:
Oh my, I, I don't know how to thank you... I never imagined...

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Don't go to that fight, Shura. You can have a new life. Leave the old one behind.

Shura:
Boss...

Shura:
I don't know how to explain it, but I have to go. It's important to me. I can't leave this place and feel at peace if I don't close the book on it.

Shura:
I can't think about tomorrow when there's unfinished business today.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Then tell me about it, Shura. Convince me.

Shura:
I always wanted to put on that championship belt... I'll never have the belt now, but I still want to prove to Coach that I'm worthy of it.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Oh, I see... sorry. I know that he...

Shura:
(Scratches head) Yeah, he's gone.

Shura:
When I was little, it was Coach who took me in, taught me how to punch and how to not get punched.

Shura:
It was hard enough for him by himself in Ursus, never mind having a kid around... he might have lived a better life if he didn't bother, but that was never on his mind.

Shura:
He wanted me to win the belt back all the way to the very end... this is the only thing I can do for him.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
...I respect your decision, Shura.

Shura:
Thanks, boss.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
I looked into that man's background, and apparently there are some rumors of underhanded happenings... it could be nothing, but be careful nonetheless.

Shura:
Yeah, I'll be careful.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
I'll buy you honey beer, if you win.

Shura:
It's a deal!

10:24 P.M. \ Clear

Muscular Man:
That suka just won't give up, will she?

Muscular Man:
She's a lucky one... can't believe she's still walking after that.

Muscular Man:
I should have a talk with the Patrol Unit... make a few rubles while I'm at it.

Shura:
Taking to yourself, Yevgeny?

Muscular Man:
O-Olav? How did you know I was here?

Shura:
I knew you wouldn't show up to the place, so I tried my luck and waited here.

Muscular Man:
I... I was waiting so long that I had to go for a walk!

Shura:
Excuses, Yevgeny. If you're scared, you might as well just admit defeat and go home.

Muscular Man:
S-Scared? Ha, very funny, Olav...

Muscular Man:
Maybe I won't bloody that pretty face of yours if you—

The man never gets the rest of the sentence out, as he finds himself staring at a fist mere inches from his nose.

Shura:
Enough talk, idiot. Put your hands up.

Muscular Man:
You...

Shura:
Try not to bite your tongue, if you really have to talk.

Muscular Man:
I-I'll kill you, suka!

Shura:
Bring it on!

Shura:
(He's got some weight to his fists. Looks like he's not all talk.)

Muscular Man:
Come on, stop dodging and fight me!

Shura:
Your fault for being slow! Gotta work harder if you wanna hit me!

Muscular Man:
I'll have your head!

Shura:
(His elbows are raised. Now!)

Shura:
Take this!

Her fists finds the man's ribs. Her foe raises his chin in pain, creating an opening.

Shura seizes the opportunity and closes the distance, landing a heavy blow on his chin.

Shura:
Now!

Muscular Man:
*Cough* *cough* My tooth!

Shura:
Ha, big one too.

Muscular Man:
Wh-Why won't you just die?!

Muscular Man:
Die, die, I'm the real champion—

Shura:
Yevgeny, you dumbass—

Shura:
Wha—who's that? What's that?

Shadow:
Blame... not the time... offended... you won't...

Shura:
(Can't hear what he's saying, or see his face.)

Shadow:
Hehe, farewell.

Shura:
Stop—damn it, just before the match...

Shura:
(Is that a gold coin?)

The weapon is kicked away and clatters across the ground. Stunned, the man is unable to react.

The Ursus girl grabs his arm and wrestles him to the ground, choking him in a headlock.

Shura:
What's with the gold coin tattoo?!

Muscular Man:
You... *cough*... help... can't... breathe...

Shura:
Speak!

Muscular Man:
Argh...

Shura:
I've been looking for it for years. It was you all along!

Shura:
It was you who infected me with Oripathy!

Muscular Man:
... *choke*...

Shura:
This is all your fault!

Shura:
I should have been the winner, the one to have my hand held high, the one to win that prize money!

Muscular Man:
Help... *choke*...

Shura:
It's all your fault, your fault...

Shura:
I should have won that prize money... it would have paid for the old man's medical bills...

Shura:
Why did you do that?

Muscular Man:
It wasn't me... the big boss... you wouldn't throw the fight... pissed him off... argh...

Shura:
What are you trying to say? You didn't have a choice? You were forced? Let me tell you. You're a coward. This is who you are, and you'll never change, right?

Muscular Man:
I... sorry... was wrong... please... don't...

Muscular Man:
Don't kill... me...

Shura:
No... enough... shut up...

Shura:
Shut up!!!

Shura:
...I can't kill you. I just can't. Dammit.

Shura:
I said this was a match... I won't go back on my word.

Shura:
I don't kill in the ring. That's a rule I'll never break.

Muscular Man:
Ugh...

Shura:
Look at you, dripping saliva and snot.

Shura:
To think that a piece of shit like you ruined my life.

Shura:
No, it's not worth it. Not for you.

Muscular Man:
Argh...

Shura:
You're lucky, trash. Get out of my sight.

Muscular Man:
Ugh... *cough* *pant* *cough*

Shura:
My fists are too good to waste on revenge.

Shura:
Too good for you.

Muscular Man:
*Cough*... I'm sorry... I won't do it again... don't kill me... *cough*

Shura:
Keep that tongue of yours to yourself. I'll pick up where I left off if I ever hear about you blabbing to the Patrol Unit.

Muscular Man:
I, I won't... don't...

Shura:
Get out of my sight. I never want to see you again.

Shura:
Alright, boss, you can come out now. I heard your footsteps ages ago.

Shura:
So you weren't sleeping when I left?

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
How could I sleep without the sound of you punching sandbags downstairs?

Shura:
Oops, sorry. I didn't think you could hear me up there.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Honestly. Well, never mind.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
I thought you were going to kill him.

Shura:
And you didn't think to step in? Man, you're cold-blooded. That scares me.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Give me a break. I'm not that kind of person... and neither are you.

Shura:
You'll really trust me so much, eh?

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
I know you have your principles, Shura.

Shura:
Yeah... I still think of myself as a boxer, even if I don't box anymore.

Shura:
The match ends when my opponent is knocked out. A boxer doesn't go any further.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Even if it's not someone worthy to call an opponent?

Shura:
I've boxed for years, boss. Opponents come and go, in all shapes and sizes, but the ring beneath my feet...

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Uh-huh?

Shura:
...It's always there.

Shura:
The ring matters to me. Every punch I throw, I have to be proud.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Well, you weren't exactly boxing in a proper ring just now.

Shura:
But the ring's always in my heart.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
You fought in underground rings, weren't you? It's not easy to stick to principles in a place like that.

Shura:
Yeah. Too many things down there not fit for the light of day. Throwing matches, betting... that's rookie stuff.

Shura:
You get to see all the blood and gore you could ever want, if you have a deep enough pocket. Boxers there are less than animals... we're toys at best.

Shura:
Maybe I would have become like them, a monster that only knows how to kill.

Shura:
Hey, what's with that relieved look on your face, boss?

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
I just wanted to tell you how happy I am to have you as a colleague.

Shura:
Boss... *sob*

Shura:
Man, you're making me blush, boss.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Don't get too carried away. You still have to put together a CV, be interviewed, assessed...

Shura:
Oh, I don't want to think about any of that. Say no more. I just want a big mug of honey beer, then a good night's sleep.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Sleep, eh? Look at your shoes first.

Shura:
My shoes? Oh, the bottoms are starting to come off. Heh, sorry, I've had these for a long time.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
I think I have an extra pair. Try them on when we get back; see if they fit.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
Let's head out as soon as possible. Who knows if that guy might change his mind and start running his mouth.

Shura:
Sorry, guess I shouldn't have let him go.

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
No need to apologize. His blood wasn't worth staining...

Shura:
My super-duper fists?

Rhodes Island Field Operator:
No, your path to a new life.
