Saileach:
You know... before I came to Rhodes Island, I'd already anticipated a lot of what I'd encounter. But it only dawned on me, once it all actually came, how none of my preparation was any use.

Saileach:
Being military—even if I was just the most minor guard of honor—I'd always believed firmly in the tenacity of life, that it shouldn't slip away so easily.

Saileach:
But in this past year, traveling all over Terra's parts with this ship, I've witnessed far too many people...

Saileach:
Too many people who part like an unnoticed gust of wind, gone gently far before you even notice they came by.

Saileach:
Unable to leave something behind.

Saileach:
I try and make a record of their faces, their lives that passed on before me, but in just one short year, they've managed to vanish from my memory too.

Saileach:
You've been through all that yourself, right?

Saileach:
But you won't give me the answers, will you?

Saileach:
*sigh*...

Saileach:
Look at me, still acting like I used to, going through everything on my mind and dumping it on you.

Saileach:
I brought some flowers today, but they're a little wilted. There weren't any convoys willing to come to these parts, so I just had to walk, and it's hard to keep a bouquet fresh all the way.

Saileach:
(Is someone there...?)

Saileach:
Sorry, Lass. Please wait a moment, if you can.

???:
It's you. Jane Willow.

???:
How come you're...?

Saileach:
How do you know my name?

???:
D-Don't kill me!

???:
I'm Acton! Acton Corsaire! 5th Defence, 6th Camp of the County Hillock Barracks. D-Do you remember me? We met, just a few years ago!

Injured Soldier:
(He pulls on his sleeve.)

Injured Soldier:
I...

Saileach:
Your arm... You weren't able to evacuate from District Seventeen?

Injured Soldier:
Not one of us had any order to retreat from above when the dirty bombs came. Maybe our kit was broken, or the commanders forgot, or maybe...

Injured Soldier:
Heh—the farmers know it best, don't they? It's hard not to mess up a few wheat buds when you pull weeds.

Saileach:
I'm so sorry, Acton.

Injured Soldier:
No, it's fine. I'm more wondering, Jane, what are you doing here?

Saileach:
I... I'm back here to grieve over someone lost.

Saileach:
What about you? Do you just live in these ruins?

Injured Soldier:
No, our camp's in the rough outside the plate, I was just in the ruins looking for food. I never thought I'd run into you.

Saileach:
So you mean, there's other people living here, aside from you?

Injured Soldier:
Yeah. On top of the soldiers who got left behind, there's a few Taran survivors drifting around here.

Injured Soldier:
After the events, the Army wanted to round up the surviving Infected and keep them under control in one place, so they organized a few searches, but we were lucky enough to avoid those.

Injured Soldier:
Then later down the line, the ruin and pollution here got too severe for their tastes, so they decided to completely abandon this plate, and leave anyone on it to fend for themselves.

Saileach:
Then... did you find anything earlier?

Injured Soldier:
(Shakes head.) Hah. Going hungry for another few days, looks like.

Saileach:
I've got some rations and medication on me. If you want it, you can have them all.

Injured Soldier:
Thank you, Janie.

Saileach:
Do you have a transmitter here? If I can get in touch with my colleagues, they might be willing to send some supplies in for us.

Injured Soldier:
Er, I've seen one in the ruins.

Saileach:
Where?!

Injured Soldier:
Not far, but it's where the Tarans are active... If the two of us run into them, it'll get very tricky.

Injured Soldier:
Both sides might be on the same raft, but everyone has it tough. We don't want to feed any more conflict.

Injured Soldier:
So usually, as long as we can... we try and keep away from each other as much as possible.

Saileach:
Acton, show me the way at least. I need to try, no matter what.

Saileach:
The active Originium's already concentrated above safe limits ahead... Is this really what the Tarans are living in?

Saileach:
I've been walking for so long... without a person in sight.

Saileach:
Wait, is that someone?!

Saileach:
Ma'am! Hold on, please!

Saileach:
I don't mean any harm!

Saileach:
I have some emergency pharmaceuticals and rations here! In exchange, would you let me use the transmitter?!

Feeble Woman:
Are...

Feeble Woman:
Are you telling... the truth? You have medicine?

Saileach:
I do. Here, look, you can take it all if you need.

Feeble Woman:
Come with me.

Feeble Woman:
Aislinn, I'm here, I brought somebody.

Dying Girl:
Hurts... help me.

Feeble Woman:
This is my girl. Can your medicine save her?

Saileach:
I... Her condition's too severe. It'd be tricky for emergency drugs to take effect.

Feeble Woman:
Try, please. She's not even seven...

Saileach:
I'll... do everything I can.

Saileach:
Aislinn, can you hear what I'm saying?

Saileach:
(She administers an injection into the girl's body.)

Saileach:
It'll be okay, don't fret.

Feeble Woman:
How is she?!

Saileach:
I'm sorry, it's just... not any use.

Dying Girl:
It's dark... Mam, I'm... scared.

Feeble Woman:
Aislinn, Aislinn, don't be afraid, Mam's right here with you.

Saileach:
I'm sorry.

Saileach:
I just... don't have anything I can do. I'm so sorry, ma'am.

Dying Girl:
It's cold...

Feeble Woman:
(Hugs the girl tight.)

Saileach:
Ma'am...

Feeble Woman:
Just go. Don't come back here.

Saileach:
I'll leave this food.

Saileach:
I'm staying in the rough outside the plate for the next few days. If any of you need help, you can come ask me.

Saileach:
Sorry to bother you. I'll be gone in a moment.

Feeble Woman:
The stuff you want to use is in the building opposite. You can move it on your own.

Saileach:
...Thank you.

Injured Soldier:
Hey, steady there!

Saileach:
Huff—it didn't occur to me how far your camp would be from the plate.

Injured Soldier:
I'm surprised you brought back something so massive all by yourself!

Saileach:
Okay, okay, no time to wallow now, Acton. Let's see if it still works at all first.

Injured Soldier:
Here's the screwdriver.

Saileach:
Oh, we're in luck. It's all intact inside. Just a little adjustment, and it'll be in service.

Injured Soldier:
You know your way around these things too? I'm blown away... When did you learn this?

Saileach:
All I can say is, I've picked up a heck of a lot from my new job. Alright, here's your screwdriver back, thanks.

Injured Soldier:
I'll go hook up the generator.

Injured Soldier:
How is it? Lights on?

Saileach:
Yep, it's on without a hitch.

Injured Soldier:
How did you find this device? Did the Taran group give you trouble?

Saileach:
No, I traded with them for the supplies I had on me.

Injured Soldier:
That's good, then. At least they know a deal's a deal.

Saileach:
Acton...

Injured Soldier:
What?

Saileach:
We need to hold on for a very long while before the supplies arrive.

Saileach:
During this period, I'd like to start up a few fields, plant some crops and ensure food self-sufficiency. It beats searching the plate by a mile, with how inefficient that is, not to mention the danger.

Injured Soldier:
That's all well and good, but... a lot of the camp are stuck in dire days. We have barely any proper manpower.

Saileach:
There's the displaced Tarans aboard the plate too. I'd like them to join in... If we can provide food and clean water, I don't think they'd refuse.

Injured Soldier:
That's not happening. The first thing that bunch did was drive the lot of us out!

Saileach:
Acton, I know the rift is intense between your two sides, and making peace seems unimaginable, but this is a dire situation. None of you have any other choice.

Saileach:
I can only offer you temporary aid. After that, carrying on all comes down to you, and the only ones left who can join hands with you and push on are them. Fellow Infected of yours.

Saileach:
So, either you shelve your grudge for the time being, and together you survive, or you hold onto your hate, and together you die here.

Injured Soldier:
Let me think... I need to ask the others.

Saileach:
Acton, I met a woman while I was looking for the transmitter... I wasn't able to save her daughter's life, but she still pointed me the right way.

Injured Soldier:
The woman with the child? I know her. No wonder... She's the only one I've seen in the past few days.

Injured Soldier:
*sigh* I can't imagine what she does now... her husband, father and sister, they all left her in that atrocity, and now... even her daughter's gone.

Saileach:
So give it a think, Acton. They're just a group of people that want to survive, same as you.

Twitchy Taran Man:
Hey, Chuck, d'you trust these people? I just feel like they'd have to have something in store for us down the line.

Apathetic Taran Man:
Don't know, nor do I want to. Haven't had a meal for days. Brain just says, eat something to keep the needle off empty.

Twitchy Taran Man:
It's some swindle, absolutely. I tell you, these army boys, they've got hell in mind for us.

Apathetic Taran Man:
So what? You keep talking, but here you are anyway.

Twitchy Taran Man:
Hmph... that Vouivre's holding onto Oripathy suppressants there. My bad parts have been feeling like murder in recent days.

Injured Soldier:
There's simple water purifiers on the camp's east. To the south is the farmland we're about to clear. The sick have all agreed to be housed for nursing in the tent on the north end.

Injured Soldier:
At noontime and evening each day, you can get a portion of food from the center of the camp.

Injured Soldier:
Ahem... that's all. Janie, anything you'd like to add?

Saileach:
Can I just ask everyone, have you seen a woman around? She's very slim, and she's carrying a girl... but the child passed away not long ago.

Twitchy Taran Man:
Máire? You mean Máire?

Saileach:
Brown hair, small mole under her eyes?

Twitchy Taran Man:
Right, that's her. What do you want with her? What, has she offended you?

Saileach:
No, I just wanted to ask, is she doing okay?

Twitchy Taran Man:
Mystery, isn't it? Haven't seen her who knows how long. Could be dead herself in someplace.

Saileach:
But you... I thought you would've at least been aware of each other.

Twitchy Taran Man:
Here?!

Twitchy Taran Man:
Vouivre, no one's got the time to care for anyone else here.

Saileach:
......

Twitchy Taran Man:
What are you looking at me like that for? I'm just... telling the truth.

Saileach:
It's fine. Thank you all for coming out so far. Get some rest as soon as you can. We have a lot of things waiting for us tomorrow.

Injured Soldier:
Janie, I don't understand. Where's the point in what you're doing? We've given them food to eat, and a place to stay.

Injured Soldier:
I'm not crossing my fingers they'll be happy with us any day, but at the very least, we could just about live without bothering each other!

Injured Soldier:
Take yesterday, I heard a brawl sprung up while work was happening, and someone's still lying on the couch today with stars around their head.

Saileach:
Ungh... this fruit's too high. I can't reach.

Injured Soldier:
Janie, Janie! Are you listening to me?

Saileach:
Hm? Oh, that, I know. It was one of yours who decided to be rude first, Acton.

Injured Soldier:
Says who?

Saileach:
I rushed over the moment the conflict sparked off, and it was me who helped the one with a knock on the head back to camp too.

Injured Soldier:
The... Did you even sort out what happened, Janie?

Saileach:
I did. So, as a token of apology, I think you can present them this basket of fruit, in person.

Pained Sickly Soldier:
This is killing me... Miss Saileach, am I going to die?

Saileach:
You'll be fine, I've already jabbed you with painkillers. Just hold on a little, and it'll kick in soon.

Pained Sickly Soldier:
Thank you... *cough* *cough*

Saileach:
How are you now? Any better?

Pained Sickly Soldier:
If you could just, keep talking to me... I'm scared.

Saileach:
What do you want to hear?

Pained Sickly Soldier:
Anything, I just want... to have a voice by my side.

Saileach:
Alright. Will a song be okay?

Pained Sickly Soldier:
Yeah...

Saileach:
'If only we were a pair of white feathers, roaming free on the breaks of the waves,'

Saileach:
'Time would farewell us to be forgotten, and never would either we sorrow again...'

Apathetic Taran Man:
Miss Saileach...

Saileach:
Shh, he's asleep.

Saileach:
(Thank you, Mr. Chuck, for being so willing to help me look after these people.)

Apathetic Taran Man:
(No problem. Want some wild fruit? I'll fetch you one.)

Saileach:
(Wild fruit? Did you pick it?)

Apathetic Taran Man:
(No, it's from an army boy. They taste alright. Don't know why they felt so kind all of a sudden.)

Saileach:
(I'm guessing, they wanted to apologize for what happened a few days ago.)

Apathetic Taran Man:
(That's a tall tale...)

Pained Sickly Soldier:
Rgh... cold.

Though his face twists as he does it, the man tucks the patient gently back into his bed.

Apathetic Taran Man:
(Tch. Boy can't even sleep tight.)

Saileach:
Acton, quickly, wake up!

Injured Soldier:
What is it, Janie?

Saileach:
There's a serious leak in the north side patients' tent! Fetch a few people to come with me, quickly!

Injured Soldier:
What?! Hold on, I'll be right there.

Saileach:
Quickly, Acton!

Injured Soldier:
I'm here. How are the sick inside? What's your plan? Dammit, the rain must have ruined these boys' conditions. What the hell do we do now?

Saileach:
The Tarans came over first thing. I suppose they've moved them to other tents by now.

Injured Soldier:
What?

Saileach:
I said, the Tarans made it in time to move the patients out! They're all safe!

Injured Soldier:
Including ours?

Saileach:
Yes, including the soldiers, but they weren't in time to shift the pharmaceuticals I brought. I'm afraid those are all soaked now.

Injured Soldier:
That's fine, I'll think of something.

Saileach:
Thank you, Deaglán, for coming with me to find Acton.

Twitchy Taran Man:
Thank those drugs you've got, not me.

Saileach:
Actually, I ran out of my medicine. The stuff we've been handing out to everyone over the last few days, that was all stuff Acton found with a few others by braving the ruins...

Twitchy Taran Man:
Tch. Some shite.

Twitchy Taran Man:
Oi, Acton! The hell are you, you bleeding moron? Will you give us a shout already!

Injured Soldier:
I'm... I'm over here, I got trapped.

Saileach:
Are you hurt?

Injured Soldier:
No, it was just, the exit collapsed...

Twitchy Taran Man:
What got you inside this cellar, anyway?

Injured Soldier:
Enough of that, give me a hand. There's an injured woman here who's out cold.

Saileach:
Alright, I'll pull her up.

Twitchy Taran Man:
It's Máire... She's still alive?

Injured Soldier:
Hey, you want a scone?

Twitchy Taran Man:
A scone? Are you having a laugh? Where'd you get the stuff to make that?

Injured Soldier:
It was Janie who whipped it up. I don't know what she went into the forest to pick yesterday, but whatever it was, it let her actually make these.

Twitchy Taran Man:
No joke? Pass me it, I'll try one.

Injured Soldier:
Who knew I'd ever be sitting here having nibbles? We used to not even have a bite to eat.

Twitchy Taran Man:
That girl led us through cultivating, raising fowls and treating the sick just fine, and she can even knock together a wood house. We're sitting here now and she's even rustled up desserts.

Injured Soldier:
Eat yours, chop-chop! Want another?

Twitchy Taran Man:
No, I'll save one for Máire.

Injured Soldier:
How is she?

Twitchy Taran Man:
Looking a lot better, but she still doesn't talk. Too much of a shock to her, losing her child.

Injured Soldier:
Bless Janie, really. She's been sitting by her side the whole time as of late.

Twitchy Taran Man:
Heh, speaking of. Here she comes.

Saileach:
Mr. Acton! I got a reply from my colleagues!

Injured Soldier:
Janie! That's smashing news.

Saileach:
Phew... They were notifying us just now to say, the branch office south is making an urgent partial transfer of their supplies to us.

Injured Soldier:
When will they arrive?

Saileach:
If all goes well, in about a week.

Twitchy Taran Man:
That's lightning fast!

Saileach:
Don't get too excited. I think, based on what they said, the convoy's run into a little issue over there? They say they can't get a precise pin on our position. Something must be funny with the signal...

Twitchy Taran Man:
That's fine, I'll head up to the plate in a sec to look. Might find some boosters.

Saileach:
Thank you so much. Another thing, we need to stand a flag in the middle of the camp to serve as a marker. That plus the locator will make it convenient for the convoy to accurately orientate once they're approaching.

Twitchy Taran Man:
A flag? It's not a tricky problem, is it? We can just tear some bright cloth and hoist it up.

Injured Soldier:
We need a design, at least.

Twitchy Taran Man:
If you want a design, you may as well grab one of the old county banners from up on the plate.

Injured Soldier:
What? You're not going to treat yourself as one of County Hillock, are you?

Twitchy Taran Man:
Hmph, could use your barracks boys' ensign as well. Might find one of those on the plate too.

Injured Soldier:
Enough... I never want to see that bloody thing for the rest of my life.

Twitchy Taran Man:
Fine... you come up with something, then.

Injured Soldier:
Janie, do you have any ideas?

Saileach:
I'm not sure myself. We'd have to see what everyone thinks.

Twitchy Taran Man:
Hmph. Here's what everyone thinks: whatever you think, that's best.

Injured Soldier:
Yeah... I'm in agreement.

Saileach:
Sorry, Acton, for making you do sewing work with me at such a late hour.

Injured Soldier:
That's fine. As long as you don't find me too clumsy.

Saileach:
*sigh*...

Injured Soldier:
Not still worrying over the flag there, are you? You look vexed.

Saileach:
I went all around the camp today asking about the flag, but people all seemed to have the same response ready when I did. They want me to decide.

Injured Soldier:
It's true. Everyone's always had faith in your decisions.

Saileach:
It just makes it harder. I need to come up with a proposal that'll satisfy everyone, or else I'll let you all down for trusting in me.

Injured Soldier:
Janie, you know, even if you turned out a blank white flag, none of us would object.

Injured Soldier:
All this time, you've been busy like mad for us, leading us onto the plate and into the forest to find food while the sun's not even up.

Injured Soldier:
You barely rest even when you make it back to camp, what with a million sorts of things needing your handling.

Injured Soldier:
I think, fundamentally, everyone's left this flag to you so that you can catch your breath, take your time sewing and properly unwind.

Saileach:
Really...?

Injured Soldier:
Really. If you kept wracking yourself over this flag, well, that would never do.

Saileach:
...Thank you.

Injured Soldier:
I'll leave the rest of it to you, then, Janie. And I think you've earned an early sleep.

Saileach:
The candlelight's... a little dim. I'll open the window wider, let the moons come in easier.

Saileach:
Oh! Acton, do you hear that singing?

Injured Soldier:
Eh?

Saileach:
It might not be too clear with how the wind's picked up. Listen, carefully.

Injured Soldier:
Oh, I hear it. Where's it coming from?

Saileach:
I don't know...

A lone, tender song floats through the breeze, trembling and shaking, but having caught it, they begin, unconsciously, to sing along with it.

And the singing gradually rises, and the wind fades. Until, in every corner of the camp, hovers the song.

......

Injured Soldier:
It's Máire... I heard her murmuring while I was tending to her.

Saileach:
It's beautiful.

Twitchy Taran Man:
*yawn*... I need my sleep, what's going on out here? Noise and all...

Injured Soldier:
Deaglán! Come over here, quick!

Twitchy Taran Man:
What happened?!

Injured Soldier:
It's Janie! It's Janie!

Twitchy Taran Man:
Eh...?

Squeezing through the crowd, the man looks to the clearing in the camp.

There, meeting the morning dew and biting winds as she faces a flagpole, stands the figure of a girl tall and straight in respect.

Her dress is in order, not a hair out of place, and she holds in her hands a rolled-up flag.

Following in the girl's song and her hoisting of the halyard, the flag ascends slowly to the sky, where the wind unfurls it.

A pair of white fowlbeasts soar upon it.
