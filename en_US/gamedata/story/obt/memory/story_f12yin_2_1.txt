Drip. Drop.

Is it raining?

He looks out the window. Lightning flashes across the sky, but the glass remains dry.

Tick, tock.

It must be the clock, then.

But he looks up at the clock, and sees that its hands have long since stopped, with only a broken wooden dummy swaying beneath.

What is going on?

His palm feels wet, as though liquid was dripping through his clenched fist and onto the ground, forming a viscous puddle.

He opens up his hand and sees that the hairs of his palm are soaked in blood.

???:
Sinner.

Anthony:
Who's there?!

???:
Hehe. You're already wearing unbreakable shackles, Anthony.

Another flash of lightning illuminates the corner of the dark room. A severed head lies on the ground, blood still gushing out from where it was separated from its body, leaving it lying in a pool of blood. It is the head that is speaking to him.

He remembers that face. It is a familiar one.

Anthony:
Val Hyde... where is your brother?

Severed Head:
Where is he? Right by your feet.

He looks down to see a corpse lying on the ground. Its torso is turned away, yet its head has swiveled around to face him. The broken neck vertebrae protrude from the skin.

Broken Corpse:
Why are you trembling, Anthony? You should be happy.

Broken Corpse:
You've waited so long for this day. To kill your hated enemies with your own hands, and let their blood soak every inch of earth here.

Anthony:
Did... did I do all this?

Broken Corpse:
Yes. Smile, Anthony. What a day. What a lovely day.

Severed Head:
You've exacted your revenge, so why the long face? Hehehe.

Anthony:
No... it's too late.

Severed Head:
Oh, my child, you came too late. Boo-hoo. Your mom and I didn't live to see the day you walked free again.

Broken Corpse:
It's all too late. Our little Tony. Boo-hoo.

Anthony:
Shut up. Shut up!

Anthony:
Murderer! How dare you pretend to talk like my parents!

Broken Corpse:
Murderer? Is he taking about us?

Severed Head:
Yes, brother. He's talking about us.

Broken Corpse:
But look around, Anthony. There's only one person in this room with blood on their hands.

Severed Head:
It's you. You're the murderer.

Anthony:
You deserved it! You deserved to die by my hands!

Broken Corpse:
Such brave words, such unwavering resolve. Everything is as you wanted, then. Why not smile, Anthony?

Severed Head:
Why are your lips pursed like that? Come on, turn that frown upside down. Smile. Laugh. Do as I do.

Anthony:
Enough! Shut up!

Severed Head:
Such terrifying eyes, brother. There's murder in them.

Broken Corpse:
The eyes of a murderer! The eyes of a sinner!

Anthony:
Shut! Up!

Broken Corpse:
Hahaha! We're waiting for you, Anthony. We'll see you in the flames of hell.

Anthony:
Is that so?

Anthony:
I'm already being burnt every day by the flames of revenge.

Anthony:
What do I care about the flames of hell, as long as I can tear you apart with my own two hands?

Anthony:
What does a charred corpse have to fear from the fire?

Severed Head:
Then come find us, Anthony. Hahahaha.

Anthony:
I will. I'll step into the flames.

A fire burns in his eyes.

Anthony:
Argh—!

Anthony:
Argh...

Anthony:
It's that dream again... my head...

Anthony:
(Covers face) What time is it...?

Communications Terminal:
Good morning, operator. It is currently 0424 hours. Current weather is overcast, and the temperature is 26 degrees.

Anthony:
Four in the morning... only three hours of sleep, then.

Anthony:
...Forget it, I can't get back to sleep.

Anthony:
My sheets are soaked with sweat.

Anthony:
I'll need to change them... the pillow, too.

Communications Terminal:
You have a new message, operator.

Anthony:
......

Communications Terminal:
Anthony, we found the money your dad left in Bunkerhill City. There's more than enough for us to make a comeback.

Communications Terminal:
Are you still haunted by what happened to your parents?

Communications Terminal:
It's not your fault. HydeBro carried out their entire plan while you were in Mansfield. By the time we heard the news, it was already too late.

Communications Terminal:
The Hyde brothers are nothing if not thorough. It's a miracle that you're still alive.

Communications Terminal:
We went to great lengths to get in touch with you. Their eyes and ears are everywhere.

Communications Terminal:
Try to pull yourself together. We'll take back what belongs to us.

Anthony:
Control, Anthony... don't let violence overcome you... control...

Anthony:
(Trembles)

Anthony:
...Damn it.

Anthony:
Damn it!

He picks up a chair and throws it at the wall, shattering the dressing mirror mounted there.

He sees his face reflected in the shards, twisted in anger.

Then, the fury fades.

Anthony:
Control, Anthony.

Anthony:
Anger and sorrow have never solved anything.

Training Room

Anthony:
(Gazes into distance)

Beehunter:
(Hm, he looks distracted...)

Beehunter:
Snap out of it, big guy!

Anthony:
What?!

Anthony:
(She's fast... I might hurt her with a hard block. I'll just protect my head.)

Beehunter:
Where do you think you're looking?

Anthony:
(Now she's aiming for my midsection!)

Beehunter:
Too late. It's all too late.

Anthony:
Huh...?

Anthony:
No—shut up!

Beehunter:
Ouch!

Anthony:
Oh no... I'm sorry, Shura. Are you alright?

Beehunter:
So that's how it is, big guy... You've never really come at me with your full strength, have you?

Anthony:
We're in very different weight classes. I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to fight back.

Beehunter:
Hmph! It wasn't <i>that</i> bad. Bring it on! Just... gimme a second to get up.

Beehunter:
Ow ow ow!

Anthony:
Apologies, I should have been more careful. I'll take you to sickbay.

Beehunter:
...Eh, these things happen in training.

Beehunter:
You look distracted, though. What's the matter? Didn't get much sleep last night?

Anthony:
Yes... Maybe I was too absorbed in the book I was reading.

Beehunter:
Well, nothing to worry about! Next time we're free, let's grab a few drinks together. That'll knock you right out, if you let 'em.

Anthony:
I'd rather not even think about drinking until we get you to a doctor.

Anthony:
How is she, Domma?

Domma:
Asleep for now. We'll need to keep her a coupla days for observation, but it don't look too serious to me.

Domma:
How'd she get hurt?

Anthony:
I accidentally injured her today.

Domma:
What?

Anthony:
Don't look at me like that.

Domma:
You ain't the type to lose control, though...

Anthony:
Don't look so surprised, Domma. You've seen me in prison.

Domma:
Yeah, which is why I know just how hard you been tryin' to hide that side of you.

Domma:
You look awful, Anthony.

Anthony:
...I've been having trouble sleeping. Seeing the same nightmare every night.

Anthony:
In it, I'm standing in a pool of blood, with blood on my hands, and the Hyde brothers are lying dead on the ground.

Domma:
That's new, never had no dreams like that before. Somethin' happen?

Anthony:
Bad news from Bunkerhill City.

Domma:
Your folks...

Anthony:
Educated guess?

Domma:
Yeah, saw that letter on your desk when I was returnin' a book. Under a pile of books, but there ain't no hidin' those tear stains.

Anthony:
I've submitted my resignation and will be leaving in a few days. I've been here too long. It's time I faced it. Everything.

Domma:
Figured this day'd come, sooner or later.

Domma:
Sometimes, I can't help but think... what if you left all that behind and stayed here? Wouldn't that be swell?

Anthony:
I've considered it, Domma.

Anthony:
Once, I thought I would give up on revenge after I'd rescued my parents.

Anthony:
But now, my only desire is to repay blood with blood.

Domma:
But you ain't never killed no one, Anthony.

Anthony:
How does it feel? How does it feel to take a life with your own hands?

Anthony:
Can you tell me, Domma? How did it feel when you injected poison into a prisoner's veins? How did it feel when you sent the body to the incinerator for disposal?

Domma:
...It hurt, at first. You feel sick, can't sleep, start seein' stuff that ain't there.

Domma:
Then, you try to justify it. Tell yourself they deserved it, that you did the right thing.

Domma:
Then, one day, when enough people have stopped breathin' on account of you, you stop feelin' anything at all. You seen enough death.

Domma:
That point, whatever crimes they did in life don't much matter no more. Their deaths don't neither.

Anthony:
Does it take a long time?

Domma:
Yeah, long and painful. Had to keep remindin' myself it was just a job. But how 'bout you, Anthony?

Domma:
How would <i>you</i> get through it?

Anthony:
......

Domma:
Seems to me you made up your mind to face it without givin' a single thought to <i>how</i>.

Domma:
We're goin' together, Anthony. I can help you.

Anthony:
No, this is my problem. I can't drag you into this.

Domma:
I's already in it. I helped break you outta Mansfield, 'member?

Anthony:
That's enough, Domma, this is not open for discussion.

Domma:
Anthony—

Beehunter:
A-Anthony!

Domma & Anthony:
......

Anthony:
Are you awake, Shura?

Beehunter:
I hearda you hadda bottle of fine whiskey... when will we getta have a taste of it?

Beehunter:
How about next Wednesday? Ya free that day, and I'm free that day...

Anthony:
Huh? But you're injured. You shouldn't drink for a while.

Beehunter:
Injured... ya, I'm injured, can't drink...

Beehunter:
Why... *sob* I'm so sad... *sob*

Anthony:
(Is she ok?)

Domma:
(Must be the anesthetic.)

Anthony:
(I see...)

Domma:
Anthony...

Anthony:
Yes?

Domma:
Promise me. Promise me you won't leave without sayin' goodbye.

Anthony:
...Alright.

Human Resources Operator:
Your exit papers are in order, sir. I'm sure you have plenty on your plate right now, so I took the liberty of bringing the paperwork over.

Anthony:
Sorry, and thank you. I should have come over to pick them up myself.

Human Resources Operator:
It's fine, I just happened to be passing through. Have a nice day, sir.

Anthony:
You too.

Anthony:
Well, that went quicker than I anticipated.

Anthony:
(Looks around)

Anthony:
I should clean up before I leave. Fortunately, there isn't much here.

Anthony:
These books... they can go to the library.

Anthony:
These bottles of liquor... I'll drop them off in the wine storage room.

Anthony:
...Oh, I almost forgot, the action movies I borrowed from Robin. I should remember to return them.

Anthony:
A leaf bookmark from Kafka, and this doll... As I recall, a Christmas present from Pinecone.

Anthony:
What's with all the trinkets in this drawer? I don't even remember putting them there. No doubt the kids staying at Medical will enjoy them, though.

Anthony:
Well, that's about it. Now to start packing... I should only need a few changes of clothes.

Anthony:
......

He freezes.

The suit hangs in the middle of the wardrobe, clear as day. He remembers everything about it, from picking the cloth, to getting measured, to the delivery.

Everyone could see how much he liked it. Everyone thought he would wear it at every opportunity.

In fact, he has hardly ever done so.

He did not want to blemish it.

Communications Terminal:
You have a new message, operator.

Communications Terminal:
Got your message, Anthony. We've made arrangements to get you to Bunkerhill City. We have people waiting for you at Tkaronto.

Communications Terminal:
I look forward to seeing you. Your parents, my brother... we have so many scores to settle with the Hyde brothers.

Anthony:
......

He lifts a hand and touches a tiny piece of embroidery on the collar.

It is in the shape of a tower.

Eventually, reluctantly, his arm comes back down again.

Anthony:
What a fool I was... Why did I buy this, knowing that I would eventually leave?

Anthony:
Such a fool.

Anthony:
Dr. Silence. Is Domma here?

Silence:
Sorry, Anthony, you might have to wait. She's treating a patient that came in this afternoon.

Anthony:
May I wait for her here?

Silence:
Of course. Water?

Anthony:
No, thank you. I wouldn't want to get in your way.

Silence:
Alright, I'll be making my rounds.

Anthony:
(Glances at watch)

Anthony:
I hope there's enough time...

Old Woman:
Young man! Hey, young man!

Anthony:
Oh, sorry, were you speaking to me?

Old Woman:
Yeah, for a while now, but seems like you didn't hear me.

Anthony:
I apologize; I was checking the time. Did you need something?

Old Woman:
No, I just saw a hole in your shirt, so I was asking if you could come over so I could fix it.

Anthony:
Thank you. I suppose I didn't notice it because I was in a hurry.

Anthony:
But I'm afraid I have to leave soon.

Old Woman:
Sit down already. Just because I'm old doesn't mean my hands don't work. It'll only take a few minutes.

Anthony:
...Thank you, ma'am.

Old Woman:
You're a friend of Dr. Domma's?

Anthony:
Yes.

Old Woman:
That's what I thought. You're always stopping by to see her.

Anthony:
Are you a patient of hers?

Old Woman:
Yeah, she's really nice. I've got bad knees, and she's been a lot of help.

Anthony:
She's always been kind like that.

Old Woman:
I guess you already know that she's leaving? She told me yesterday that I'm being handed over to Dr. Silence.

Anthony:
...Is that so. What a shame.

Old Woman:
Must've heard some dumb patient calling her a weirdo behind her back. Silly, really! She's so patient and detailed. You don't get many doctors like her.

Anthony:
I completely agree.

Old Woman:
But I guess that's that. Dr. Silence said she tried to convince her to stay, but she wouldn't change her mind.

Anthony:
She may be gentle on the surface, but she's stubborn. Once she puts her mind to something, no one can change it.

Old Woman:
After relying on her for everything when I was stuck in a hospital bed, helping fix her friend's clothes is the least I could do.

Old Woman:
There, how's that?

Anthony:
Wonderful. Thank you.

Old Woman:
Oh, there's no need to thank me.

Anthony:
(Glances at watch)

Old Woman:
Are you leaving?

Anthony:
Yes, I have to go.

Silence:
You sure you don't want to wait? She'll be done in a minute.

Anthony:
No.

Silence:
Hold on, you're going by yourself? I thought she was coming with you.

Anthony:
No, I came to say goodbye. I'm the only one who's leaving.

Silence:
Oh, I must've misunderstood then. I could've sworn you were taking her with you.

Anthony:
No, it's better for her to stay at Rhodes Island. My revenge is my own business. I don't want to drag anyone else into it.

Anthony:
Speaking of which, can you do something for me, Dr. Silence?

Silence:
Well, you can ask.

Anthony:
Can you give this book to her?

Silence:
Just a book?

Anthony:
And a message. Tell her that...

Anthony:
Tell her I haven't finished it yet. Tell her to keep it safe.

Silence:
When will you be back for it? What do I tell her?

Anthony:
......

Silence:
Silence is the crueler answer, you know.

Anthony:
You take care. I need to go now.

Silence:
Anthony!

Silence:
Anthony...

Silence:
...*sigh*.

Silence looks down and sees that the corner of one page has been folded. She opens the book and sees an illustration.

A man stands in a prison cell, his back to the window, his face obscured by shadows and iron bars. He extends a wilted finger through the bars and out beyond the picture.

There is a single line of text beneath the illustration.
