Rope:
'Scuse me~

Rope:
......?

Rope:
'Scuse meee, anyone in—

Rope:
Hmmm?

Rope:
Aw, man.

Rope:
Nobody in? Morniiiing—Mooorniiiing—Just checkiiiiing—Anyone iiiiiiiin—! Halllll—looooooo—?

Rope:
......

Rope:
Huh, actually deserted.

Rope:
That's sucky.

Rope:
Wasting my time somewhere empty-handed ain't my style. Hm-hmm, I'm here after all. Let's let your li'l Peter Pan of Lungmen, Rope, take a look, see what nice stuff's lying around...

Rope:
...Wait, no!

Rope:
(Claps face)

Rope:
Stoppit, stoppit, Rope. Pull it in. You can't do that.

Rope:
(Claps face) (Claps face)

Rope:
Ugh, what a scary habit to have.

Rope:
But you can't leave the door unlocked when no-one's in. That's just too sloppy. You can't blame anyone else when you lose something, okay?

Rope:
I swear I won't take anything. Just looking, looking...

Rope:
Just lemme looksie, scope what's good around here~

Rope:
Hm? What's on the ground here... iunno. Who cares? Let's jump it!

Rope:
Hohoh, these flowers are real pretty with their colors. Dunno if they're worth anything...

Rope:
Oh, this ain't equipment you see everyday. Probably pretty expensive, huh?

Rope:
And over this way's... herbs?

Rope:
Hm? Hmm?? Whoooa, what IS this smell? This is pungent!

Rope:
I'm, I'm getting a little dizzy...

Rope:
Pteh—haah, close call!

Rope:
Oh, crap, I thought I was about to faint. That was way too risky...!

Rope:
'Better to jimmy open a Lungmen treasury box than charge an open door.' No wonder a mentor once said that. Kinda makes sense now.

Rope:
......

Rope:
Heh, okay, the joke ends here.

Rope:
If nobody's in, then I'm all hands tied. Wanted to do a little good for once, too. Whatevs.

Rope:
I guess I'll just come next time—

Rope:
Hm?

Rope:
What, I'm not the only one on the down-low?

Rope:
Hehey, now this is getting interesting. Wherever you came from, li'l dodger, let's have a duel~

Rope:
Pitter patter, sneakity skatter... position scoped, hook ready—

Perfumer:
Morning dew, peppermint, shaved ice showers♪

Perfumer:
Setting sun, jasmine, honey flowers♪

Rope:
Uh...

Perfumer:
Hm-hmm~, hmm~, hm-hmm hm-hmm~~

Rope:
Uh, esscuse me...

Perfumer:
And add just a little culture. Hmm, that should be a good amount!

Rope:
No, c'mon, you're way too focused.

Perfumer:
And then mix it with the deep soil here. Oh, or perhaps add a little bit more plant ash?

Perfumer:
Mhmm, this should do it just nicely!

Rope:
(Has she literally not noticed me? You need to keep your wits about you, y'know?)

Rope:
(And here I thought some thief actually got in. Eugh.)

Perfumer:
Hmm... the balance still seems a little off. Last time's cultivar had balance issues too. Phew, let me think, what should I do...

Perfumer:
Peat, akadama... maintain weak acidity...

Rope:
(Still talking to herself. Is this, like, an okay situation?)

Rope:
(Oh, but watching from the side is pretty fun~)

Perfumer:
!

Perfumer:
That's right, how could I forget! I can try adding in some sandy soil brought from where it grew!

Perfumer:
Mhmm, no matter plants or people, they're all best at home!

Rope:
(Kind of makes sense to hear.)

Rope:
(But y'know the sort who really work to flee the nest? Never wanna go back, those people? Uh, people? Plants? Whatever, same thing. There's plenty of them, right?)

Perfumer:
Oh, now where did I put that soil again...

Perfumer:
Not here, and not here. Hmm... how strange...

Perfumer:
Hm?

Rope:
Hm?

Perfumer:
!!

Perfumer:
Wha-wha-wha?!

Rope:
?!

Rope:
Huh? Huh??

Rope:
What-what's wrong? What's up?

Perfumer:
Eh? Ah...

Perfumer:
Miss... Rope?
