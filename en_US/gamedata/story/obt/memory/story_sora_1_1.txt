Panicked Lungmen Citizen:
What's going on?! Who are these people...?

Panicked Lungmen Citizen:
It's... it's Reunion! Why are they attacking us?!

Trapped Lungmen Citizen:
H-Huh...? What is going on—

Panicked Lungmen Citizen:
What... What are you people doing?

Panicked Lungmen Citizen:
Stop it! This is our neighborhood!

Reunion Member:
Gah, scram if you don't want trouble!

Trapped Lungmen Citizen:
Ughh—!

Trapped Lungmen Citizen:
You... You can't do this...

Reunion Member:
Why not? You know what kind of a rotten life you've got in this pathetic place.

???:
Stop it—

Reunion Member:
Who's there?

Trapped Lungmen Citizen:
I know that voice... It's her...!

Sora:
I made it... *pant*...

Sora:
Please don't hurt them. They are innocent!

Sora:
You've already razed a few blocks' worth of streets and shops. There are the homes of innocent civilians... How are they supposed to get by now?

Reunion Member:
Who cares?

Reunion Member:
Like I give a crap how they live. Now scram, or you're next!

Sora:
I'm not going to back down. I've spent my life bringing happiness... to encourage people to stay positive and live on.

Sora:
That's why... if you're going to destroy their lives... I will protect them. I am more than capable.

Sora:
Besides, I've got help.

Reunion Member:
Stop bluffi—

Exusiai:
(Whistles)

Reunion Member:
Who's there...?!

Croissant:
Sorry we kept ya waitin', Sora.

Sora:
Croissant, Exusiai, and... Texas.

Texas:
I don't think they're all that discouraged by anything you just said.

Exusiai:
In that case, it's time that we, Penguin Logistics, allies of justice, show you what for! Boink! Kapow! We'll knock you all down, just like that!

Reunion Member:
'Penguin Logistics?' Heh, you really think you can stop us?

Exusiai:
It's an emergency, so we've got no time to check with the boss, but he's not one to just stand aside while a bunch of bad guys muck up our turf! This is where we do business, after all!

Sora:
Watch out. We don't know what these men might do. I'll stall them here and put a stop to it.

Texas:
Okay, Exusiai and I will take them out. Croissant, help evacuate the residents.

Croissant:
On it, yeehaw!

Texas:
First, let's secure the path east...

Reunion Member:
Heyah—

Reunion Member:
...Huh?

Sora:
♪~♪~♪~

Reunion Member:
W-Why can't... I... move?

Texas:
Hmph, take this—

Reunion Member:
*cough*... It's the singing girl's Arts... Stop her song. Take her out first!

Trapped Lungmen Citizen:
*Pant*... *pant*...

Trapped Lungmen Citizen:
Did they... stop?

Exusiai:
Heh... Trying to ambush us? Let's kick this into Overloading Mode, then!

Texas:
Now. Run.

Reunion Caster:
Running away? Not so fast... Let's try... this—!

Sora:
♪~♪~♪~

Reunion Caster:
Impossible... Not even my Arts are working...?

Exusiai:
Heheh, that's not all that Sora can do! Sora, rouse me up!

Sora:
Okay... on it!

Trapped Lungmen Citizen:
Miss Sora... Is it really you? But... Why are you here...?

Sora:
♪~♪~♪~

Exusiai:
Now! Get 'em—

Panicked Lungmen Citizen:
Just who are you people...?

Exusiai:
Get clear first!

Croissant:
There ain't time to think 'bout all that... Giddy up! Get movin'!

Sora:
♪~♪~♪~

Sora:
(Huh? That girl over there...)

Trapped Lungmen Citizen:
(Ugh... I can't. I can't let anybody see me like this...!)

Croissant:
Texas, the L.G.D.'s gonna be here mighty soon!

Texas:
Alright. Exusiai, Sora—

Sora:
Yes, I got it...!

Exusiai:
Time to split! Buh-bye!

Sora:
That girl...

Sora:
I think I've seen her before... No, I've definitely met her before.

Sora:
Is that her...?

Sora:
She was at the front of the line to hand me a letter at my first fan meeting in Lungmen.

Sora:
Then, after one last letter, she stopped coming to my events...

Sora:
I'm sure of it. She's my very first fan, after all.

Sora:
But... what is she doing here in the slums?

Sora:
And... those Originium crystals on her arm...

Sora:
Did she... become an Infected?

A few days later

Penguin Logistics Office

Exusiai:
Ahh... I'm pooped.

Exusiai:
Huh, Sora? I didn't know you were here.

Sora:
Oh, Exusiai, Croissant. Yeah, I'm done with practice for the day.

Exusiai:
That's good. We're about to head out. You wanna come with us?

Exusiai:
We gave the L.G.D. a hand the other day, and apparently they gave Boss a call, asking us to stop by their office to get a 'Lungmen Benevolent Organization' certificate.

Exusiai:
After we've done a photoshoot in front of L.G.D. HQ, let's see if anybody dares pull me over~

Croissant:
If'n yer drivin', yeah, you'll get pulled over. With them pitchers, though, I reckon ain't nobody gonna come checkin' my business licenses no more...

Exusiai:
If you ask me, I think your little side business deserves to be inspected.

Croissant:
Heh, just makin' a quick buck.

Croissant:
So what'cha doin', Sora? Hmm... This a letter?

Sora:
Yeah, it's... a letter from a fan.

Croissant:
Boy, that brings me back. When ya first got here, there was always all kindsa presents pilin' up in front of Penguin Logistics. Mailboxes stuffed to burstin' with fan mail.

Sora:
Haha... Why don't you two go on ahead? I'll wait for Texas.

Exusiai:
Sounds good. Here's the key. I'm hitching a ride with Croissant~

Croissant:
Don't worry yer li'l wings, Exusiai. I'll get'cha there safe n' sound n' right on time!

Exusiai:
Don't be late, Sora! We don't get to be stand-up, model citizens every day!

Sora:
Yeah, I won't.

Sora:
(This should be the one...)

Sora:
(The handwriting... I remember it very well.)

Sora:
(She was there at my fan meeting... My very first fan...)

Texas:
Oh... Have you been waiting for me?

Sora:
......

Texas:
Sora?

Sora:
Hm? Oh, sorry, Texas. I spaced out.

Texas:
It's alright.

Texas:
Did something happen...?

Sora:
Oh, don't worry... It's not a big deal...

Sora:
......

Sora:
Texas... Were the people we helped in the slums the other day... all Infected?

Texas:
That's what's on your mind?

Sora:
Yeah...

Texas:
Was there somebody you knew?

Sora:
I'm not sure... but I think there was a girl... who I might've met once... probably.

Sora:
If that was really her, then she'd only be there because she was Infected. She wasn't... someone who lived there.

Texas:
...

Texas:
Did you see the letters?

Sora:
Letters? What letters?

Texas:
They came with the notice from L.G.D. this morning. Apparently they're letters of appreciation from the residents we saved.

Texas:
Those letters are the reason the government is giving us that certificate.

Texas:
Isn't that what you're reading right now?

Sora:
Oh, no... This is... a fan letter from before.

Texas:
A fan letter? You're reading it now, of all times...?

Sora:
Uh... Don't worry about it...

Sora:
It really is nothing, Texas. I suddenly felt like it. That's all...

Texas:
...

Texas:
Are you coming with me to the L.G.D.? I'll drive.

Sora:
Mmhm. I'll go!

Texas:
Get in the car then.

Sora:
Texas... If... Just if. If a Lungmenite becomes infected, what options do they have?

Texas:
I can only think of two.

Texas:
They either have to leave Lungmen or go to the slums.

Sora:
Right... There's no other way... I know that.

Sora:
Texas.

Texas:
Hmm?

Sora:
In the future... will I be allowed to go on deliveries alone? I don't want to be a bother... but I am a member of Penguin Logistics, and I want to help out like everybody else.

Texas:
Can you protect yourself?

Sora:
I... I can...!

Texas:
Once you prove to me you can hold your own, I won't stop you.

Sora:
Yeah, thanks.

Sora:
It kind of feels like I'm always thanking you...

A week later...

Lungmen, somewhere in the slums

Sora:
Hello, is anybody home? Your package is here!

Slum Dweller:
Who is it...?

Sora:
Hello, the items you ordered on the Penguin Logistics website are here. Could you please sign for the package~?

Slum Dweller:
A package...? Leave it outside the door.

Sora:
Okay!

Sora:
Umm... could you please sign for the package as well?

Slum Dweller:
I... I'm not sure I can step outside...

Sora:
Huh? Is everything okay? Do you need any help?

Slum Dweller:
No, that's not what I meant... I don't want to come outside... You... You're not infected, right? I have Oripathy... I could spread it to you...

Slum Dweller:
I appreciate Penguin Logistics at least letting me place orders, but you could catch Oripathy from me. Please just go!

Sora:
Mister... Mister? Please, calm down.

Sora:
We've got long, stable relationships with Infected clients. Oripathy isn't something you can catch from physical contact.

Sora:
Don't worry. All Penguin Logistics staff have received Oripathy prevention training. You can't hurt me.

Sora:
And if you need any assistance, we can help you out anytime. We've partnered with a pharmaceutical company on several projects...

Slum Dweller:
......

Sora:
Mister, are you okay?

Slum Dweller:
Are you... not afraid of me?

Sora:
Of course not! Penguin Logistics aims to serve all customers with wholehearted devotion!

Slum Dweller:
Never mind... Leave it at the door.

Sora:
Okay...

Slum Dweller:
Right, can I count on you people to deliver a letter uptown for me next time?

Sora:
Of course! Penguin Logistics offers mail delivery too!

Slum Dweller:
Eh... fine. I need to let somebody there know how I'm doing. If they're willing to write back.

Sora:
Um, Mister...? If you would like, I can help you get in touch...

Slum Dweller:
No, never mind. Just stay away from me. My brain is a mess right now.

Sora:
I...

Sora:
Okay...

Slum Dweller:
Let's leave it at that. I'll use you guys again next time.

Sora:
It wasn't her...

Sora:
I couldn't find her today either... Maybe she's already left Lungmen.

Sora:
Maybe it never was her anyway...

Sora:
But the handwriting in the appreciation letter to Penguin Logistics is the same as the fan letter I got.

Sora:
She didn't leave an address or a name. It was just a simple thank you letter, but I know it. It was you.

Sora:
...I just... want to see you once again...

Sora:
Are you willing to see me? Should... I even see you?

Sora:
There is something I want to tell you face to face. I want to tell you that you've got to cheer up and find hope again.

Sora:
Tomorrow... I'll come again tomorrow.

Two weeks later...

Lungmen slums, during a delivery

Sora:
Hello, is anybody home? Your package is here!

???:
......！

Sora:
Hello, the items you ordered on the Penguin Logistics website are here. Could you please sign for the package~?

Sora:
Is anybody home?

???:
......

???:
(Grits teeth)

Sora:
Hm... this is the right delivery time...

Sora:
Yeah...

Sora:
Hello? Is there really nobody home?

???:
(Trembles)

???:
...It's her voice.

???:
But...

???:
......

Sora:
(It's the right place... Are they not home?)

Sora:
I'll leave it at the door and send them a delivery confirmation... Okay.

Sora:
......

Sora subconsciously places her hand on the edge of her pocket. Slowly, she takes out the letter.

On the old, tattered envelope are the words 'To Miss Sora.'

Sora has read the letter inside and compared it with the letter of appreciation countless times. Its contents have been etched into her soul—

Not only do the words of appreciation within evoke her nostalgia, they help keep her mind at ease.

Sora:
How come I can't find you? I saw you around here not too long ago... Have you really gone somewhere else?

???:
......

Sora:
I... want to see you again.

???:
......！

???:
......

The person inside grips the door handle.

Yet the door does not open.

Sora:
But it's no big deal... I know we'll meet again.

Sora:
Okay, time for the next package... Where does this one go...?

???:
She's gone... right?

Slum Infected:
......

Slum Infected:
(Bends over)

Slum Infected:
(Picks up the package)

Slum Infected:
Thank you... Miss Sora.

Slum Infected:
Looks like you got my letter.

Slum Infected:
I want to see you again too, but right now... my body... my disease...

Slum Infected:
......

Slum Infected:
You'll be happy once I finally find the courage to face myself again, right?

Slum Infected:
I... I'll come to your concerts again, and I will be there at your fan meetings.

Slum Infected:
Someday.
