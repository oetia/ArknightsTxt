You shouldn't follow me.

Where I am going, the flames of war rage unchecked.

You'd only be in the way. No need to get yourself killed.

???:
I...

???:
......

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Savra, what are you doing, standing there? Get down if you want to live!

???:
！

Sarkaz Mercenary:
*Sarkaz profanity*! Incoming! Take cover and keep your head down!

???:
*Cough* *cough*...

Sarkaz Mercenary:
You still alive?!

???:
I'm fine.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
They found our vantage point. We don't have much time left! Get a move on!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Again, so soon?!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Argghhh! Son of a...! My leg!

???:
(Uses Arts)

???:
This way!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
*Cough*. Thanks, brother.

???:
All I did was find us some cover. No need to thank me.

???:
Is your leg doing okay?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I'm fine. I've been scratched up like this many times before. I'll be okay with a bandage.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I'm probably not one to talk, but you don't seem like you can hold your own in a fight that well. I'm surprised you managed to survive this long.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I saw you use Arts to move the cover. That's the technique of a seasoned veteran.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
How long have you been on the battlefield?

???:
I've been through training many times, but I'm afraid this is my first deployment.

???:
I only made it this far thanks to luck. I haven't done anything too great.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Well, you're a humble one, I'll give you that.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Anyway, we really can't keep this up for much longer.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
The bigwigs are probably having an easy time, but this is starting to be a bit too much to bear for the rest of us.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Looks like we're the only ones left here. I wonder how the others are doing.

???:
I got separated from my team... Our ambush failed, and the enemy scattered us.

???:
It doesn't look like much is happening up ahead. I'm guessing anyone who charged up ahead are all...

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Well, what a coincidence. It's the same for me.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I'm not expecting them to go back to help me at this point.

???:
The mission may be a failure, but I'm not planning on dying here.

???:
I'll scout out our surroundings. We may be trapped, but there has to be a way to break out of this.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Scout? You?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Listen, I'm not trying to look down on you, brother.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
But I promise, it doesn't matter how much cover your Arts can make you. The moment you poke your head out, you'll be blown to pieces.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
My suggestion: We stay here and observe.

???:
I'm afraid we can't do that.

???:
3 o'clock... We've got company.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Those freaking Kuranta?

???:
They're light infantry. Most likely the Kuranta mercenaries. There may be others as well... They work together fairly often, after all.

???:
Once they charge in here, we won't have anywhere to run.

???:
They might even have some caster drones with them.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
How'd you know that much?

???:
Simple deduction, guesswork, and experience.

???:
I could be wrong, of course, but that should more or less be it.

???:
We may stand out if we go now, but we can't hide here for very long.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
If you know so much about them, do you have a way to take them out too?

???:
I'm afraid not with my Arts. I'll probably be killed the moment I try to attack.

???:
Honestly, running away is about all I can manage right now.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Hahahaha, sounds like whoever hired you really got a lemon.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
They're losing this war because they're too stingy and only bought men like you. You get what you pay for.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
By the way, before I forget...

Sarkaz Mercenary:
What's your name, Savra?

46A:
I have many names. You can call me 46A for now.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Heh, is that a name now? Sounds more like a model number for some kind of appliance.

46A:
It's just one of my codenames. You can call me that for the time being.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Well, it sounds to me you haven't made up your mind.

46A:
My name isn't important.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Guess it isn't. Looks like you're the same as me. Just playing it by ear, earning our keep.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Was that an explosion?!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Quick, 46A! Let's go!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I've been a merc for a long time, but this is my first time seeing anyone use drones to guide artillery fire.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Those drone casters are getting way too hard to deal with these days.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
If we'd found out sooner, so many of us would still be alive...

46A:
I tried to cover our tracks. Hopefully that will buy us some time.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
You know all kinds of Arts, don't you?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Why don't you take care of these wounds for me while you are at it?

46A:
Sorry, I don't know healing Arts.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
It's fine. Just figured I'd ask.

46A:
Our medic was the second one to go missing.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Don't let it get to you, brother. It happens pretty often out here.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
If it wasn't for you, the Kuranta would've blown a hole through my guts already.

46A:
So nobody else made it out?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Looks like it.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
But that also means we're safe.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Can you walk on your own?

46A:
I'm fine.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Let's keep going, then. The rendezvous point shouldn't be much further. If we keep this up, we should be there in about an hour.

46A:
Good.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I really backed the wrong horse this time. The nobles were paying top dollar, so I figured this one was a sure win.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Who knew we'd get all those mortar shells dropped on us? The moment that happened, everyone just took off, running for dear life.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I feel sorry for those brothers I've fought alongside over the years.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
They got their money, but at what cost?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
*Sigh*...

Sarkaz Mercenary:
How about you, 46A? You here because of how much they were willing to pay, too?

46A:
There were some supplies I needed.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Hah, no need to sugarcoat it like that. All of us are putting our lives on the line to earn our crust.

46A:
I'm looking for someone as well.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Looking for someone? What, on the battlefield?

46A:
That's correct.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Who are you looking for? Family? An enemy?

46A:
Someone I owe my life.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Hoh.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
That's interesting.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Well, it sounds like something you'd do, but you're probably looking in the wrong place.

46A:
It's a life debt, and—

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Fine, whatever. Let me give you a bit of advice. Don't let yourself be taken advantage of!

Sarkaz Mercenary:
I wasn't going to say this, but you're a weird one. Do you really think you can find the one who saved your life in Kazdel?

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Maybe they weren't even trying to save you.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Think about all those men you've worked for up till now, all the people you've worked with. All of them ready to turn against you at a moment's notice.

Sarkaz Mercenary:
Maybe the moment you find them, they'll—

I never imagined I would make such a mistake. I didn't see the attack coming at all.

Were those explosives? Arts?

My ears are buzzing.

46A:
*Pant*... *pant*...

But I'm not going to die here.

Even if I can't see anything, even if I have to crawl my way out of here, I am going to live.

???:
You always make it through everything alive, Savra.

???:
But I never thought you'd make it this far.

???:
You are not like those good-for-nothings.

46A:
Who are you...?

???:
You've made it this far. You have my approval.

???:
I guess I must also give you a conclusion.

???:
Will you face your past?

???:
Or will you face the future?

???:
Make your decision.

46A:
......

The Savra feebly holds his staff up.

46A:
Can I come with you this time, Owl?

Rangers:
Rise and shine, young'un.

12F:
Ughh......

12F:
What are you doing here, Mr. Rangers...?

Rangers:
Everyone else is busy today, so it's just us two Savra sharing drinks and conversation.

Rangers:
Do you remember now?

12F:
R-Right... It's coming back to me.

Rangers:
Here, have some cold water.

12F:
Thank you.

Rangers:
Try rubbing your eyes. Harder.

12F:
*Phew*... *huff*.

Rangers:
This is how I used to sober myself up when I was your age. It does the trick, doesn't it?

12F:
I suppose. Thank you, Mr. Rangers.

Rangers:
No need to thank me. We're both Savra.

Rangers:
This is a kind of remedy I came up with. Only works on us folk.

Rangers:
Were you dreaming, 12F? You seemed rather stiff.

12F:
Oh, I guess I did have a rather strange dream.

12F:
Something from the past came back to me, that's all.

???:
Tell me. What's your name?

46A:
I... I don't have a name... Only a codename.

???:
Well, you just follow me from here on out. Like I said, there'll be far more dangers waiting ahead of you.

???:
How far you can make it. Well, that depends on you.

???:
Who you've been up till now just died here. Today is the day you died. It's also the day you were born.

???:
Right, why don't I give you a new name as a present?

???:
Let's see. It's March 3rd today...

???:
Alright, you'll be 12F from here on out.
