Inam:
Here. Gavial told me you're with Rhodes Island too.

Inam:
My lieutenants are all businessmen. I've taught them a little Sargonian. Talk to them if you need anything.

Asbestos:
Alright. But why's that one staring at me?

Inam:
We don't get many guests here, so it's a bit of an occasion.

Inam:
It is for me, at least!

Shy Archosauria:
Look at that tail!

Frank Archosauria:
Long and fleshy... It looks so soft and flexible too... Are those orange patterns on it?

Frank Archosauria:
Look, she's carrying all that stuff with her tail! And lifting that heavy door with one hand! Wow!

Frank Archosauria:
She must be really good at wrestling. That tail looks like it could break a tree in half. She's so beautiful!

Frank Archosauria:
I've never seen someone like that. I wanna be friends with her!

Shy Archosauria:
Wait, you're going up to her just like that? I, I'm not sure... whoa...

Happy Archosauria:
Metal Crab armor, Metal Crab greaves! Their hard shells stop any attack!

Serious Archosauria:
Sawfin tooth hammer and Sawfin bone sword! Their sharp edges cut through anything!

Asbestos:
......

Shy Archosauria:
(She's coming...!)

Frank Archosauria:
Hey, hello!

Asbestos:
Something wrong?

Frank Archosauria:
Oh! Well, I like your tail!

Asbestos:
?

Asbestos:
My tail? The hell are you talking about?

Asbestos:
I'm busy. Outta my way!

Shy Archosauria:
(Whoa! She's scary...)

Frank Archosauria:
Oh, wait!

Frank Archosauria:
No need to be angry, right? I said I like you!

Frank Archosauria:
What about you? Don't you think my tail's nice? People say I've got a cool tail!

Asbestos:
Ha? What're you on about now?

Asbestos:
Go play in the mud with your friend.

Shy Archosauria:
You speak our language? In a pretty rowdy way, though...

Frank Archosauria:
I'm not playing in the mud! Did you think I'm a kid or something?

Frank Archosauria:
...We'll have a fight!

Asbestos:
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

Asbestos:
Outta my way!

Asbestos:
Are you nuts?

Asbestos:
Fine, you're nice, your tail's nice, super nice!

Asbestos:
Oh? C'mon, gimme a break!

Shy Archosauria:
It's a fight!

Happy Archosauria:
Hey, watch out—woo, that's right, get your tail round her neck!

Serious Archosauria:
Oh no, my oil—hey, that was neat, using oil to slip out!

Group of Archosauria:
Woo! Fight! Fight!

Asbestos:
......

Frank Archosauria:
Quick, this bush will hide us.

Shy Archosauria:
Haven't you guys fought enough yesterday? Why do I have to be here too?

Shy Archosauria:
And what about you two?

Happy Archosauria:
She bought a bunch of stuff. Of course we want to check it out.

Frank Archosauria:
She took a few scales off my tail last time!

Frank Archosauria:
She bought all that stuff, but she's living in a shed out here instead of in the village?

Frank Archosauria:
Not a bad spot though. That tree isn't too far from the river, but not so close that it would get flooded.

Asbestos:
......

Shy Archosauria:
S-She caught a huge bug!

Shy Archosauria:
She's frying it!

Shy Archosauria:
She's putting it on bread!

Shy Archosauria:
She ate it!

Frank Archosauria:
Ughh...

Asbestos:
......

Happy Archosauria:
Look at her, she's putting rocks in her soup.

Happy Archosauria:
That's the kind of salty rock that gives it more flavor. How did she know about them? I don't think anyone in the village told her.

Serious Archosauria:
Hey, she knows about those vines that you told me about too. The ones that have a tangy sweetness when you chew them.

Asbestos:
......

Serious Archosauria:
Is she going out to catch fins?

Happy Archosauria:
Maybe striped fins, but sawfins aren't so easy to catch. I've caught a few with my tail, but it hurts quite a bit.

Happy Archosauria:
Maybe outsiders can learn about the rocks and vines, but when it comes to fins—

Asbestos:
Ha!

Serious Archosauria:
How did she do that?

Serious Archosauria:
She... I....

Happy Archosauria:
Pff.

Happy Archosauria:
Let's go and find some vines.

Serious Archosauria:
......

Two hours later

Shy Archosauria:
Um, uh...

Asbestos:
Still tailing me? Did you think I didn't see you?

Asbestos:
What about your friend? Eaten by fins?

Shy Archosauria:
Er, no, she saw you eat the bugs and got hungry too, but—

Shy Archosauria:
Looks like she ate the wrong kind!

Shy Archosauria:
C-Can you help us out?

Asbestos:
Eh?!

Asbestos:
What is WRONG with you people?

Shy Archosauria:
It was because you ate them...

Asbestos:
......

Asbestos:
So what kind did she eat? How many?

Shy Archosauria:
Not sure... and just a few.

Asbestos:
Did she vomit? Is she conscious? Are there any spots on her skin? Swelling?

Shy Archosauria:
Er...

Asbestos:
Forget it, I'll take a look myself.

Asbestos:
No fever, no rashes. Take this herb and boil it in water. It'll make her throw up.

Asbestos:
Give her plenty of water.

Shy Archosauria:
She threw up three times until there was nothing left, then fell asleep.

Shy Archosauria:
Is she gonna be okay?

Asbestos:
Just give her more water and stop yapping already!

Shy Archosauria:
......

Happy Archosauria:
......

Serious Archosauria:
......

Happy Archosauria:
The fire is so warm.

Serious Archosauria:
I want to sing.

Happy Archosauria:
Heh, me too!

Happy Archosauria:
We love a muscle that's big and whole~♪

Serious Archosauria:
You farm, and I hunt~ There's teeth white and tough in my little runts~♪

Serious Archosauria:
Hey!♪

Asbestos:
!

Asbestos:
......

Asbestos:
Seriously, why are you people still here? What am I, your mom?

Happy Archosauria:
Are you saying you're our mother? What do you mean?

Serious Archosauria:
Maybe it's the tail? She's got a tail too. Maybe we're relatives!

Happy Archosauria:
Where are you from, Mom?

Shy Archosauria:
W-Why do you eat bugs, Mom?

Happy Archosauria:
And why come here? You bought my stuff too. Are you gonna live here?

Asbestos:
Just— *Sigh*... I...

Asbestos:
I'm not your mom, and I'm here to climb the waterfall.

Serious Archosauria:
You've gotta be kidding, no one's ever climbed it!

Asbestos:
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

Serious Archosauria:
Then why are you climbing it? You'll die! And what for? Are there more fins up there?

Asbestos:
...For the view.

Shy Archosauria:
The view? From the waterfall? Can't you find those anywhere?

Asbestos:
......

Asbestos:
It's exciting. Climbing it'll be fun.

Happy Archosauria:
What? How is that exciting? We're happy enough just living here and getting our three meals a day.

Serious Archosauria:
Yeah, this is where we live. Plus, what if there's a bunch of poisonous bugs up there? You'll die! That's not exciting.

Shy Archosauria:
Yeah, you'll die! Don't be silly!

Asbestos:
Er... I...

Shy Archosauria:
We saw you eat bugs. Did you spend all your money shopping a few days ago? But you can make money if you catch a bunch of fins!

Serious Archosauria:
Yeah, follow Inam and you'll make lots of money!

Shy Archosauria:
And your parents will be sad if you die!

Asbestos:
Parents? They ain't around anymore.

Shy Archosauria:
Oh.

Asbestos:
But what's with all this death talk? Never said I was gonna die.

Shy Archosauria:
Oh, that's good.

Happy Archosauria:
Then let's keep singing! Do you want to learn our songs?

Serious Archosauria:
You farm—♪

Asbestos:
(Deep breath)

Asbestos:
Oh for god's sake stop talking already even that girl wasn't as noisy as you people I should've gotten some duct tape to shut you up for good!

Happy Archosauria:
Whoa! What did she say? That wasn't Sargonian, was it?

Serious Archosauria:
Did one of her eyes just change color?

Frank Archosauria:
Argh! Ugh! Uhhhh...

Asbestos:
Finally! She's awake! Now you can take her and scram!

Shy Archosauria:
Are you alright?

Frank Archosauria:
Ugh... guh...

Asbestos:
Shit, and out like a light again.

Asbestos:
Whatever. You have doctors, don't you? Stop wasting time with me.

Asbestos:
Now piss off.

Shy Archosauria:
Alright, thank you, miss!

Serious Archosauria:
(Doesn't change the fact that she's weird through. Maybe we should knock her out and take her away in a sack if things don't go well.)

Asbestos:
Hell no!

Asbestos:
Oh, it's morning.

Asbestos:
Yesterday was so tiring... I should go before those guys come back.

Asbestos:
Looks like that's everything. Time to move!

Asbestos:
And here we are.

Asbestos:
It's even more daunting up close. What am I getting myself into?

Asbestos:
Well, here goes nothing!

The surroundings are silent, save for the deafening roar of the waterfall. Asbestos climbs against the raging current, tugging at her rope, the top of which is swallowed by the splashing foam.

It is always the same—climbing towards unknown heights, or descending into unknown depths.

She knows that there is a stunning view at her destination, but not what difficulties that she might encounter on the way.

It could be a slip, a fall, wild beasts, snowstorms, or perhaps some disaster or challenge she could never imagine.

Asbestos:
(The current's too strong. I can't find my footing!)

Asbestos:
(There's a branch there!)

Asbestos:
(Good, it's pretty solid. I should be able to avoid the currents by following it...)

Asbestos:
Ha!

Asbestos:
So slippery!

She knows how it feels to lose her balance in rapid currents, pushing her lungs to the limit in suffocating whirlpools.

She knows how it feels to keep climbing through the night after breaking her arm from a fall halfway up, just to catch a glimpse of the sunrise from the top.

She knows how it feels to slip and fall on a glacier, the ice chips ripping through her skin.

But she also remembers seeing the rays of the setting sun reflect upon the icy surface when she stood up again, accompanied by a sweet icy breeze.

At that moment, Asbestos no longer cared about her bleeding wounds. All the pain and suffering, all the hardship—it was all worth it.

Asbestos:
*Cough* *Cough*...

Asbestos:
Aye, that was one hell of a shower... good thing there's a gap here.

Asbestos:
But I'm still alive! And almost there!

Asbestos:
Here we go!

Every time she gets up again, she is thinking the same thing.

It was bloody worth it.

Half an hour later

Shy Archosauria:
*gasp*... *gasp*...

Frank Archosauria:
I'm exhausted...

Happy Archosauria:
I took a look around. No poisonous bugs, so she won't die. Oh, and these vines grow here too? Wow, there's a lot of them!

Happy Archosauria:
It's such a great place up here! So many vines growing here!

Serious Archosauria:
Haha, you may be fierce, but you're pretty darn good!

Frank Archosauria:
Hey, back off!

Frank Archosauria:
I had my eyes on her first!

Frank Archosauria:
Oh, and sorry about the other day. Kanna told me you outsiders don't like fighting. I shouldn't have hit you.

Frank Archosauria:
But your tail is really cool!

Asbestos:
Oh, for the love of—!

Asbestos:
Just shut up and take in the view!

The Archosauria are wet and muddy, with pieces of grass in their hair.

A wind from the canyon blows the grass into the sky, until it disappears in the distance.

They see a sight they have never seen before—their own home.

Shy Archosauria:
Look over there!

Happy Archosauria:
Wow! Look at that!

Their hearts are filled with myriad emotions. Beautiful, stunning, spectacular—or perhaps something beyond what any word could describe. Just like the outsider who gazes at the view in fascination, their cries of joy echo through the canyon.

Asbestos:
Woo!

Asbestos:
Wahoo!

Asbestos:
Wow...

Asbestos:
It's beautiful.

Serious Archosauria:
Wow...

Serious Archosauria:
I want to sing.

Serious Archosauria:
Let's surround her! Join hands and sing!

Happy Archosauria:
Your waterfall is rushing, there's fins for your plate~♪

Serious Archosauria:
You swing about your tail, so the fins take the bait~♪

Shy Archosauria:
Climb up your waterfall, it's such a pretty sight~♪

Frank Archosauria:
It's such a pretty sight, oh, such a pretty sight~♪

Asbestos:
!

Asbestos:
Ha. Fine.

Asbestos:
......

Asbestos:
Such a pretty sight~♪

Asbestos:
Hey, stop spinning!

Frank Archosauria:
Cheer and laugh, till we make the sky sing~♪

Shy Archosauria:
Make the sky sing~♪

Happy Archosauria:
We'll be going!

Serious Archosauria:
Goodbye, friend!

Asbestos:
Yeah, yeah, later guys!

Asbestos:
So tired.

Asbestos:
Where do they get the energy for all that noise? I'd rather climb ten waterfalls.

Asbestos:
Now, what should I write for this one?

One month later

Inam:
Magazine delivery from Asbestos! There's one for everyone! Her travel journal's inside.

Group of Archosauria:
?

Inam:
A travel journal is a record you keep of what you see and experience when you visit a new place.

Inam:
Wow, she grades the sights pretty harshly. And she looked so happy when she came down from the waterfall.

Inam:
It's in Rim Billitonian. I'll translate it. There's a new section: 'Meet the Locals.' You guys are in it!

Group of Archosauria:
We're in a book!

Inam:
Ahem! It opens like this:

Asbestos:
'They're noisy, but fun.'
