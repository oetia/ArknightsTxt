Passerby A:
Morning, Hung. Day off?

Hung:
Hehe, something came up, so I had to call out.

Passerby A:
Are you sick? You should go home and rest!

Hung:
Nah, it's not that.

Passerby A:
So, how's your new job going?

Passerby B:
(Whisper) Shh! That look on his face, I bet he got fired again.

Passerby A:
(Whisper) Again? How many times has that been...? Kid's too nice and doesn't know how to be flexible.

Passerby A:
(Whisper) You've got to be clever to make it these days.

Passerby B:
(Whisper) Yeah, got to move with the times.

Hung:
......

Former Boss:
What did I tell you when you first showed up? Don't poke your nose where it doesn't belong!

Former Boss:
Looks like you spent so much time at the top that your brain got addled from the lack of oxygen.

Former Boss:
You gotta be flexible if you wanna do business in Lungmen!

Former Boss:
You have any idea how much work it took to get this batch of goods?

Former Boss:
And you threw it all out, just because you weren't sure of the source! Thank you very much, Mister Avatar of Justice!

Hung:
Boss, this stuff's dangerous... what if it gets into the hands of the mafia?

Former Boss:
Who cares as long as they pay in gold and silver? Who do you think you are, trying to teach me how to do business?

Hung:
But...

Former Boss:
But what? No buts. Get out, and don't let me see your face again.

Hung:
Sorry, boss, I just...

Former Boss:
Get out! You're just like your dad. He deserved to be broke, and you deserve to be out on the street!

Hung:
Boss, this has nothing to do with my dad...

Former Boss:
GET LOST!

Hung:
(Rumble—)

Hung:
(Sigh... I should get something to eat, then I can think about what to do next.)

Street Ad:
Grand opening! 20% off during the opening promotion! Don't miss your chance to taste authentic Shangshu home cooking!

Hung:
(Reaches for the wallet)

Hung:
I think I have enough. Let's go.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Welcome! What can I get you?

Hung:
Er, let me look at the menu.

Noodle Shop Owner:
How about our signature item the 'Full House?' A set of meat and vegetable toppings. It's really great!

Hung:
Thanks, but I'll just have a bowl of plain noodles.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Just plain noodles? No drink, no sides?

Hung:
No, thanks. Just plain noodles.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Hmph. Fine, take a number and get in line.

Hung:
...Thanks.

Lee:
I'm looking to get a small bowl of noodles... any recommendations for a first timer?

Noodle Shop Owner:
That would be our signature 'Full House.' Everyone loves it!

Lee:
Sure, I'll take it.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Now that's what I like to hear. Here's your number, and I'll have it to you in a jiffy.

Lee:
Alright then, thanks.

Lee:
Hey, buddy, have you eaten here before? What do you think?

Hung:
No, this is my first time.

Lee:
Ever had Shangshu food before?

Hung:
I had some when I was little, at a big restaurant with my dad. I loved it.

Lee:
Haha. Bigger isn't always better when it comes to restaurants.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Here's your noodles, sir. Would love to hear your thoughts afterwards, good or bad.

Lee:
Sure thing.

Hung:
Excuse me, what about mine...?

Noodle Shop Owner:
You can't rush things, you know. Noodles take time.

Hung:
But this gentleman's are ready. Why are mine taking longer?

Noodle Shop Owner:
What are you talking about? You didn't order the same type.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Young people these days have no patience. Good food takes time!

Lee:
Ahem. Probably shouldn't keep your customers waiting, friend. You just opened, after all.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Huh? Oh, yeah, you're right, enjoy your meal.

Hung:
(Nods in gratitude)

Lee:
Haha, don't mention it.

Hung:
Phew...

Hung:
(I guess I can wait a little longer.)

Hung:
(The interior of this place looks pretty nice. I guess this is the Shangshu style.)

Hung:
(When I was little, dad said we would go to Shangshu and really dig into the local cuisine... bah, no use thinking about it when he's not around anymore.)

Hung:
(Hey, why is that guy peeking left and right?)

Hung:
(He took out a paper packet... Wait, did he just pinch something into the bowl?)

Hung:
Hey, what are you doi—

Hoodlum:
Hey, boss, what's going on here?!

Noodle Shop Owner:
Is there a problem, sir?

Hoodlum:
There's a bug in this bowl! Look, a huge one, black and shiny.

Noodle Shop Owner:
That's impossible. I hold myself to the highest standard of cleanliness.

Hoodlum:
Talk all you want! I got proof floating right there in this bowl!

Noodle Shop Owner:
What are you trying to pull?! I've got cameras watching the shop, they'll prove you're just looking for trouble.

Hoodlum:
(Flips over the table) Huh? You want a fight?

Busy with their argument, neither party notices that the bowl of noodles, which was launched into the air with the table, is headed straight for Lee.

Lee:
Hm?

Lee:
(No rush. I can dodge it after another bite.)

Hung:
Ow, it burns!

Hung:
Are you ok, sir? Did any of the soup hit you?

Lee:
I'm fine. You got a faceful of the hot noodle soup, though. Here, use this handkerchief.

Lee:
(Ack, I guess I owe him one now.)

Hung:
Thank you.

Hung shakes off the pieces of noodles and vegetables on his face, then wipes it with the handkerchief.

He holds the soiled cloth in his hand, not sure what to do. He looks over to Lee, seeing him point to the top of his head.

Lee:
There's still something there.

Hung scratches his head, feels something hard in the fur, and pulls out a big, black, shiny bug.

Hung:
......

Hoodlum:
You want a beating, huh?

Noodle Shop Owner:
H-Hey, what are you doing?

Hoodlum:
I'm not playing word games with you anymore. The fist talks louder!

Noodle Shop Owner:
Alright, I won't charge you for the noodles. How about that?

Hoodlum:
Are you kidding me? You think one bowl of noodles is gonna do it?

Noodle Shop Owner:
Let... let me go, I can't breathe...

Hoodlum:
You—

Hung:
You heard him? Let him go!

Hoodlum:
And who do think you are? Go eat your noodles and stop poking your nose where it doesn't belong.

Hung:
Didn't you hear him? Let. Him. Go.

Hoodlum:
Looks like you want a beating too, eh?

Hoodlum:
I... I'm sorry, it's all my fault, I won't do it again... please, let me go...

Hung:
Could you stop crying? You make it sound like I'm bullying you.

Hung:
(I hit him harder than I meant to. I hope he's okay...)

Hung:
Are you gonna be alright? Do you need a doctor?

Hoodlum:
(No way he really cares! He's making sure that I won't spill the beans on him!)

Hung:
Are... you alright?

Hoodlum:
I-I'm fine, I just fell down on my own, nothing to do with you at all, not a thing!

Hung:
Er... fell down? I thought I...

Hoodlum:
No, you weren't even there, don't worry, it's all my fault for being so clumsy, haha...

Hoodlum:
I-I gotta go, bye!

Hung:
You're limping... just be careful, don't try to run too fast.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Thank you very much! Small businesses like ours always have a hard time.

Hung:
You're not hurt, are you?

Noodle Shop Owner:
Not at all, thanks to you.

Hung:
(Rumble—)

Hung:
Er, sorry, but... are my noodles ready yet?

Noodle Shop Owner:
Oh, how silly of me! Take a seat, and I'll be right up with your order.

Lee:
Thanks, kid. A certain little girl would've chewed my head off if I went home with soiled clothes.

Hung:
You have a daughter, sir?

Lee:
Not exactly... well, I guess daughter's the best way to put it.

Hung:
Oh? What do you mean?

Lee:
It's a long story... say, you have some good moves. Who did you study with?

Hung:
I'm nothing special, just learned a couple things from my dad.

Lee:
I remember there was a guy who owned a security firm who used the same grappling technique. His surname escapes me at the moment...

Hung:
Ko. That's my father.

Lee:
Yeah, that's it! How is he?

Hung:
He passed away last year.

Lee:
Ah... I'm sorry to hear that.

Hung:
It's all in the past now, but thanks for the kind words.

......

Noodle Shop Owner:
Here's your noodles, sir. I added a bit of meat broth for you, a touch of extra flavor.

Hung:
Oh... thank you.

Hung:
(Picks up chopsticks)

Noodle Shop Owner:
Now...

Hung:
(Puts down chopsticks) Is there something you wanted to say, sir?

Noodle Shop Owner:
Well, you know, rent around here is high, and businesses are always barely scraping by.

Hung:
Yes, I know...

Noodle Shop Owner:
Sure, chasing away that hoodlum was a big help, but you also made a mess of the place while you were at it.

Noodle Shop Owner:
We ought to keep it separate, no? The noodles are for helping me out, which is one thing.

Hung:
And the other?

Noodle Shop Owner:
About the mess you made... surely it's fair to ask that you pay for repairs?

Hung:
(Tightens fist) I was only trying to help you...

Noodle Shop Owner:
Hey now, what's with the fist?

Noodle Shop Owner:
You're gonna punch me? Looks like you're no better than that hoodlum, pushing people around just because you know kung fu.

Hung:
No... I didn't mean to...

Noodle Shop Owner:
Then pay up!

Hung:
Sir, you shouldn't do this... it's not right...

Noodle Shop Owner:
What do you mean not right? Break something, pay for it. It's the proper way to do things.

Hung:
I...

Hung:
You only took a couple of bites, dad... you're not gonna get better like this.

Sickly Man:
Oh, don't you worry. The guy in the next bed over already laughs at me for how over-protective my son is... *cough*, *cough*.

Hung:
Well, you shouldn't laugh with him, the way your lungs are. Anything else you want to eat? I can slice another apple for you. Hard to sleep on an empty stomach, after all.

Sickly Man:
It's been a long time since I've had fried rice.

Hung:
Not sure that's a good idea. It'll give you indigestion and keep you up all night.

Sickly Man:
Worrying again. I was just kidding, Fine, fine, slice me up an apple.

Hung:
Alright...

Sickly Man:
How's working coming along? Has Old Li been yelling at you?

Hung:
It's going great. Uncle Li says I've got a great attitude.

Sickly Man:
Who do you think you're fooling? That long look on your face, I bet you got a good chewing out. No need to hide things from your dad, tell me the truth.

Hung:
Well... I got into an argument with Uncle Li. It's just not fair for him to mistreat his customers like that over a few coins.

Sickly Man:
Sigh, you're just like me, always so stubborn about doing the right thing. I paid my price; don't be like me.

Hung:
Why do you say that? You've always taught me right and wrong.

Sickly Man:
And look where it got me! You're barely twenty, with your whole life ahead of you. No need to get yourself bruised and battered like me.

Hung:
What are you talking about, dad?!

Sickly Man:
Listen to your father, Hei-sing. Sometimes, you have to let it go rather than banging your head against it forever.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Daydreaming, kid? Like I said, the bill's fifteen thousand. How do you want to pay?

Hung:
(Loosens fist)

Hung:
...I don't have a lot of money on me. Can I pay it by helping out around the shop?

Noodle Shop Owner:
Ha, sure, wouldn't hurt to have some free labor. I'm sure you can put those muscles to use washing dishes. Meals and bed not included, just to be clear.

Lee:
I'm done eating. I'll leave the cash here.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Thank you! Have a pleasant day, sir.

Lee:
Oh, you said you wanted my thoughts, didn't you? Actually, I just found a big problem that I'd better share.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Appreciate it, sir, but I'm a little busy right now.

Lee:
Sure, I can wait. Not sure if you can though.

Noodle Shop Owner:
Er... well, what is it, sir?

Lee:
I was counting your fire extinguishers here while I was eating. I saw three.

Lee:
But if I'm not mistaken, we got some new regs last month that require a minimum of six for an establishment of this size, with a five thousand dollar fine per missing piece.

Lee:
Let me run the numbers here real quick... comes out to fifteen thousand.

Lee:
The fire department's really cracking down on this stuff lately. One call, and the fire marshal's here in minutes. I do wonder if you'd have the time to sort things out.

Lee:
That sure is a pickle, isn't it?

Noodle Shop Owner:
No need to beat around the bush, sir.

Lee:
Given that you just opened, I think you should probably let it go. Trouble's bad for business.

Noodle Shop Owner:
So you're here to play nice guy, eh? Don't you have better things to do than stick your nose where it doesn't belong?

Lee:
Oh, but I think my nose very much belongs here. Fire safety is the responsibility of each and every Lungmen citizen, after all.

Noodle Shop Owner:
You... how dare you...?

Noodle Shop Owner:
Fine, fine, whatever! Forget it, just get out, both of you!

Hung:
......

Lee:
You heard the man. Let's go.

Hung:
Thank you so much for helping me out, sir. I'm not sure how to repay your kindness, but if you ever need a pair of strong hands, I'm happy to help.

Lee:
Ha, don't mention it. All I did was say a few words.

Hung:
S-Sir!

Lee:
Really, there's no need to thank me.

Hung:
N-No, it's not that.

Lee:
Is there something else?

Hung:
Could you... could you teach me?

Lee:
Teach you? What could I possibly teach you?

Hung:
I used to believe that right and wrong were as clear as black and white.

Hung:
But now, thinking back on things, I see only gray; where white ends and black starts, I just can't tell.

Lee:
Oh? And why is that?

Hung:
There are so many people here in Lungmen. People looking for money, for justice, for life, for fun, for fame, for the truth... they all gather here.

Hung:
Everyone has a different story, and everyone has their own ideas of right and wrong.

Hung:
When one person's right is another's wrong, they resort to violence and force their ideas on each other.

Hung:
What's right and wrong? Where's justice and fairness?

Hung:
Teach me what you know, sir. I don't want to keep banging my head until I bleed, but I also don't want to bow down to anyone.

Lee:
You're still young. It's natural you feel lost.

Lee:
But I can't teach you what you want to know...

Lee:
I'm just one of the many people here in Lungmen, after all.

Hung:
Sir, I...

Hung:
(Rumble—)

Lee:
...But maybe I can teach you something else. Like how to make fried rice that tastes just right.

Hung:
Fried rice?

Lee:
Yeah. How about it?

Hung:
I... Yes. Thank you, sir.

Lee:
Let's go, then. We can get some spring onions and eggs from the market on the way.
