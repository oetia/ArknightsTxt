Enciodes:
Doctor, no doubt you already know that the Silverash clan's exploration of the outside world began with my ancestors—namely, my grandfather.

Enciodes:
As recounted in Kjerag folklore, he once went on an expedition with an adventurer, eventually returning with a wealth of silver and gold.

Enciodes:
While he did in fact spend over ten years away with an adventurer, in truth he returned with nothing of value.

Enciodes:
Only a few bits of literature, some tools that were considered advanced at the time, and blueprints.

Enciodes:
These trinkets would go on to greatly influence my father, Olafur, who became the first person in all of Kjerag to study abroad.

Enciodes:
He met my mother Elizabeth while studying in Victoria, where he also made connections among the nobility.

Enciodes:
It was then that Viscount Walden became friends with my father.

Enciodes:
When I stayed in the same city on my own trip abroad, I received some assistance from the Viscount. I also met his children—Carle and Kate.

Enciodes:
Carle was my age, and full of pride. While he saw me as a rival in all things, he was far from a bad person.

Enciodes:
However, I had the misfortune to learn that he was attacked and killed by Infected some time after we parted.

Enciodes:
After his death, Viscount Walden became more and more hateful towards the Infected, drafting a number of restrictions targeting them.

Enciodes:
Realistically, it all depends on the particular nobles running each city.

Enciodes:
Different branches of Karlan Trade also need completely different strategies for working the Infected, depending on local conditions.

Enciodes:
Rest assured, Doctor. I shall personally ensure that Rhodes Island's reputation is upheld.

Enciodes:
Now, there's no need to be nervous. I've only received reports of your recent activities. I don't know what your plans actually are.

Enciodes:
But I surmise that connections with a powerful viscount can only work in your favor.

Enciodes:
Regardless, Kate is the subject of our concern this time. She was kidnapped—by Infected.

Enciodes:
This is partly why the Viscount agreed to let me pass this on to you, despite his disgust towards the Infected.

Enciodes:
You see, he worries that his own actions may have provoked this, and as such he is willing to employ any means necessary.

Kal'tsit:
......

Kal'tsit:
The daughter of the Viscount of County Sykes was kidnapped by a group of Infected. They demand a ransom of 100,000 pounds within twenty days, or they will kill the hostage.

Kal'tsit:
Viscount Walden hopes we will be able to find and rescue his daughter.

Kal'tsit:
He is well-known among the nobles of Western Victoria for having his eldest son was slain by the Infected a few years ago, as well as for the strict policies he's enforced on them since.

Kal'tsit:
The laws and regulations the Infected are subject to in Sykes are more stringent than any other county.

Dobermann:
More importantly, Walden's surname is Caster.

Dobermann:
The Caster family is very influential in Western Victoria, and if we can form connections with them, it may save us a lot of trouble down the road.

Kal'tsit:
But therein lies the problem.

Kal'tsit:
Naturally, a noble so hostile to the Infected would not normally entrust this commission to us directly. And in fact, it was passed on through an intermediary.

Kal'tsit:
That intermediary's name is Enciodes.

Kal'tsit:
If you were involved, it'd be reasonable to assume that this might erode your relationship with the rest of Rhodes Island.

Kal'tsit:
I doubt he'd be so reckless.

Kal'tsit:
A delicious cake, placed before us right when we're most hungry? I am skeptical, to say the least.

Kal'tsit:
But I must admit that, ignoring whatever Enciodes might be scheming, this commission is still very tempting.

Kal'tsit:
I'm inclined to agree.

Kal'tsit:
Rhodes Island has been making moves across the nomadic cities of Western Victoria, to find places we can stopover at.

Kal'tsit:
Considering his renown among Victoria's nobility from his time studying abroad, it's hardly surprising that he would have noticed our movements.

Kal'tsit:
If anything though, he is the one with more to lose from this interaction, yet he is the one who reached out to us.

Kal'tsit:
As such, I am forced to understand this as a sign of his trust in you. I can't think of another explanation.

Kal'tsit:
Your tour in Kjerag earned his 'trust', did it not?

Kal'tsit:
Looks like you understand after all.

Kal'tsit:
Or rather, I will treat that as being the case.

Kal'tsit:
I must confess I had the same instinctive response, given what I saw of your operation report.

Kal'tsit:
However, the mere arrival of this commission proves the value of your trip to Kjerag.

Kal'tsit:
Naturally, I do not intend to pry into your relationships.

Kal'tsit:
But I will simply remind you: as our cooperation with Karlan Trade is ongoing, we must be careful how we handle our relationship with Enciodes.

Kal'tsit:
Admittedly, your trip to Kjerag has brought about some unexpected benefits.

Kal'tsit:
But you should also understand that what we are about to do next is an exception, and I strongly recommend not getting tangled up with any Victoria-adjacent figures beyond a business capacity.

Kal'tsit:
It is extremely dangerous—for both you and him.

Caster Operator:
Doctor, I've located the target. They're hiding in the forests on the outskirts of the city.

Caster Operator:
Hardly. All it took was a little asking around, and some tracking in the slums.

Caster Operator:
But damn, this city really treats its Infected terribly. They're all miserable here.

Caster Operator:
By the look of it, the noble girl's kidnapping was carried out by the only relatively large group of Infected in the city.

Caster Operator:
Their security was pretty tight for amateurs, so I took some pictures of the surroundings first.

Caster Operator:
These are the pictures taken from around their holdout point.

Caster Operator:
And this is a picture I got of their boss.

Enciodes:
Hm...?

Caster Operator:
What's the matter?

Enciodes:
I see, so that's what's going on, is it?

Enciodes:
Doctor, I have a rather presumptuous request.

Infected Underling:
Boss, we're running short on food.

???:
If push comes to shove, butcher 'Sand' and let our brothers eat meat.

Infected Underling:
H-How could we do that? Isn't she the burdenbeast you raised yourself?!

???:
People are starving to death, and you're worried about some animal?

Infected Underling:
*Sigh*...

???:
Hang in there just a little longer. After we get the money, we'll change our identities and start a new life in another city.

Infected Underling:
I know.

Noble Sister:
Brother, perhaps I should head back home in secret first?

Infected Brother:
Are you stupid? How do you even expect to get back without any skills? Just stay put like a good little hostage.

Infected Brother:
And what did I tell you about getting too close to us? Are you TRYING to catch Oripathy? Scram.

Noble Sister:
Ugh...

Infected Underling:
Wh-Who are you people?!

Enciodes:
Easy now. I'm here to speak to your leader.

Infected Underling:
Well, you're not welcome here! Get out, now, or you're leaving in a body bag!

Noble Sister:
Enciodes...

Enciodes:
You're not going to invite us in, Carle?

Infected Brother:
Stand down... Let them through.

Infected Underling:
But...

Infected Brother:
You can't beat them.

Enciodes:
Rest assured, I didn't bring any weapons or bodyguards.

Infected Brother:
So what brings Enciodes, the illustrious president of Karlan Trade, to our humble abode?

Enciodes:
As I recall, the last I saw you was at that ball eight years ago.

Enciodes:
How prideful you were back then, as the eldest son of Viscount Walden.

Infected Brother:
Yet everyone's eyes were on you the moment you stepped out.

Infected Brother:
Tch. Damn and blast.

Infected Brother:
Listen up, Enciodes. I have no interest in waxing lyrical about my days as a noble. I've long since quit that game.

Infected Brother:
The only thing I care about right now is how you found this place. You and that enigmatic hooded person next to you. What are you trying to do with just the two of you?

Enciodes:
I'd heard that you died during an Infected riot. Seems the situation was more complicated than that.

Infected Brother:
You bloody daft or something?!

Enciodes:
Just a little curious.

Noble Sister:
If father asked you to come, then please turn back...

Noble Sister:
I will not be going with you.

Enciodes:
I assume you and Carle planned this kidnapping together, Kate?

Enciodes:
And if I'm not mistaken, you must have been the one to come up with the idea.

Noble Sister:
Yes, you're right...

Noble Sister:
Carle's had a terrible time all these years since he became Infected. I've been trying to aid him and his friends in secret, but there's only so much I can do alone.

Enciodes:
So you offered to let your brother kidnap you, in order to collect a ransom from your father.

Enciodes:
Viscount Walden loves you dearly, and will surely be devastated.

Noble Sister:
I know... I don't want to make father sad either, but I just can't bear to see Carle suffer so.

Infected Brother:
Shut your mouth, Kate!

Noble Sister:
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought it up...

Infected Brother:
In any case, Enciodes, if you're here as the old man's mouthpiece, I'd recommend you leave, now.

Infected Brother:
And if you plan on taking Kate with you, you'll have to ask my brothers what they think of that.

Enciodes:
Calm down, you two. Although I did come at your father's request, I stand before you as myself.

Enciodes:
And next to me is my friend. 'Doctor' will suffice.

Enciodes:
I am here to help you.

Infected Brother:
Help, huh? Help, charity, handouts. Why not just use your favorite word? What was it again... Ah yes, a 'deal'.

Enciodes:
You're free to take it however you like.

Infected Brother:
In your eyes, I might as well still be that blowhard of a noble who was always showing off.

Infected Brother:
Maybe if I were still that same man, I would have some chips to wager with you.

Infected Brother:
But now I have nothing.

Infected Brother:
You want to make a deal? What would you offer me? And what could I possibly give you?

Enciodes:
That all depends on how this conversation goes.

Enciodes:
First of all, I can assure you that Viscount Walden will never know anything that happens here.

Infected Brother:
Hah... I can't remember the last time I had a serious talk with anyone other than Kate.

Infected Brother:
Even if it's coming from you of all people, I can't help but to think back to the old days.

Infected Brother:
At least let me thank you for showing me respect, in your own way. Not that I feel at all respected.

Infected Brother:
But I knew you couldn't help me the moment you waltzed in here, grand as anything, like the world was already in your hands.

Infected Brother:
You want to know why I'm alive? How my quarrel with the old man got to this point?

Infected Brother:
Fine, I'll tell you.

Infected Brother:
You completely stole the spotlight in that ball, and you wouldn't believe how much that upset me.

Infected Brother:
So I left the venue early that night, thinking that as long as you were in Sykes, I'd rather be anywhere but there with you.

Infected Brother:
And while my head was lost in the clouds, I accidentally ran over a woman.

Infected Brother:
Now, I'm no saint, but I wouldn't just do a hit-and-run, so I took her to the hospital.

Infected Brother:
But when we got there, I found out she was actually Infected, so no one would treat her.

Infected Brother:
The most hilarious part though? That the doctors were all so eager to help me, the Viscount's son, right up until they saw the Originium crystals on her skin and recoiled in horror.

Infected Brother:
I just couldn't understand at the time. I honestly could not wrap my head around it. I knew that having Oripathy was bad, but I never expected it to be THAT bad.

Infected Brother:
So my temper flared up and I brought her back home. Made our personal family doctor see to her.

Infected Brother:
Naturally, the old man was furious when he found out, but I pushed back against him.

Enciodes:
This all sounds vaguely familiar, but I was busy getting ready to move on to the next city at the time.

Infected Brother:
That's right, you bastard. You decided to just up and leave after making such a big splash. I don't even want to know how many girls' hearts you took with you.

Infected Brother:
Looking back though, I have no idea what came over me back then.

Infected Brother:
It's not like I wasn't scared of Oripathy, but I couldn't see what about it made everyone shit their pants like that.

Infected Brother:
But now I understand how terrifying it truly is. Some patients will straight up explode when they die.

Infected Brother:
Some don't, but their deaths are still very painful. Heh, better watch yourselves. Maybe I'll blow up too, and take the both of you out with me.

Infected Brother:
Hm? Hey, Hood, your reaction's pretty different from Mister Cool here. You Infected too?

Infected Brother:
No wonder you seem so comfortable with all this.

Infected Brother:
If you're that bored, why don't you go hang out with my brothers?

Infected Brother:
This is none of your business.

Infected Brother:
You're really a doctor then?

Infected Brother:
Spare me. You think I can afford a medical bill?

Infected Brother:
In any case, the old man wouldn't let the lady stay in his house, so I had her convalesce in my own courtyard.

Infected Brother:
For the longest time, she thought I was planning to do something to her, but it was much simpler than that. I just wanted her to get better.

Infected Brother:
I was a complete idiot at the time. I'd push back against anyone that tried to go against me, no matter the reason.

Infected Brother:
The old man wanted to kick her out, so I insisted on keeping her. She thought she'd be a burden on me, so I wanted to look after her even more.

Enciodes:
You fell in love.

Infected Brother:
Damn right I did. It's a story as old as time. A noble and a commoner fall in love, but the family will never approve. Finally, father and son turn against each other.

Infected Brother:
Only difference is, the commoner was Infected, and the father had a hand in tormenting her to death. So the noble infected himself as revenge against his father.

Enciodes:
I see. So that's the basis of both your 'death' as well as Viscount Walden's hatred of the Infected.

Infected Brother:
Naturally. His son with a bright future fell in love with an Infected and turned against him. Unwilling to admit his own failures, who else could he blame but the Infected?

Infected Brother:
And... I was already the Infected he hated the most.

Infected Brother:
The news of my death wasn't a lie, Enciodes.

Infected Brother:
The man named Carle Caster died, seven years ago.

Enciodes:
......

Infected Brother:
Look, you have that expression on your face again.

Infected Brother:
What do you think is going to happen even if I do get the ransom?

Infected Brother:
I share the money with my brothers, then we move to another city and live out the rest of our lives in peace?

Infected Brother:
No, we'll still be turned away at every door, simply because we are Infected.

Infected Brother:
We'll still be looked down on. We'll still have stones thrown at us. We'll still be driven to suffer in the slums.

Infected Brother:
Even if we wanted to work, nobody would take us in. The only thing left for us would be to find a cozy little alley to die in.

Infected Brother:
Of course, the money wouldn't hurt. A few of us have already starved to death.

Infected Brother:
But how much would that money actually be worth?

Infected Brother:
After years of groveling, struggling to survive with my Infected brothers, I finally understand.

Infected Brother:
The Infected cannot survive.

Infected Brother:
I've heard of a group called Reunion that was uniting the Infected. And of an organization called Rhodes Island trying to save our lives.

Infected Brother:
Who knows when their help will ever reach us?

Infected Brother:
It may not happen in my lifetime.

Infected Brother:
But at very least, they have the ability to help because they know how hard it is for us to even survive.

Infected Brother:
But you. You know nothing.

Noble Sister:
Carle...

Enciodes:
......

Infected Brother:
So, you might as well kill me right now. Bring Kate back to the old man, claim his reward.

Infected Brother:
Or, just turn back. You can even tell him everything, if you want. What difference does it make?

Infected Brother:
Point is, there's nothing you can do for me.

Enciodes:
It seems I've made something of a fool of myself.

Enciodes:
Let's go, Doctor.

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
Doctor, I have a question.

Enciodes:
Did I act out of line when dealing with Carle?

Enciodes:
In other words, my usual performance didn't work in front of him.

Enciodes:
Hm...?

Enciodes:
That's... Carle?

Enciodes:
He's headed out alone... in the direction of the city?

Enciodes:
......

Infected Brother:
I'm begging you, my sister seriously needs an anti-infection device.

Infected Brother:
This is all the money I've got, but I assure you, give me a few days and I'll come up with the rest. Let me take out an IOU on this, and I swear I'll pay it back double!

Merchant:
Shoo, away with you! Stop coming here to beg every day, it's pissing me off.

Merchant:
Like hell I'd believe that you can get that kind of money in a few days. That's what every debt-ridden deadbeat says. What's to say that you won't just take the blasted thing and I never see you again?

Merchant:
Besides, Lord Walden has decreed that we aren't allowed to sell anything to the Infected within the city.

Infected Brother:
But I can't get my hands on anything like that in the slums!

Infected Brother:
I've looked all over to find you. Everyone speaks of how kind you are, so can't you see how desperate I am? Can't you help me just this once?

Infected Brother:
This is everything I have on me. Whatever you want, just take it.

Infected Brother:
Or maybe I can earn my keep? I swear, I won't let anyone find out that I'm Infected!

Infected Brother:
Please... I'm begging you... Just this once...

Merchant:
Fine, enough of that. How could you possibly have anything of value on you?

Merchant:
Come in. Keep wailing like that, and you might even attract the guards.

Infected Brother:
Thank you, thank you so much!

Merchant:
And get off your knees already, you're going to dirty up my floor.

Caster Operator:
Roger that.

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
Somewhat.

Enciodes:
No, I'll admit it, I'm surprised.

Enciodes:
Now I better understand why he said I can't do anything for him...

Enciodes:
And Kate, how long do you plan on following us?

Noble Sister:
I'm sorry...

Enciodes:
Did you know of this?

Noble Sister:
Yes, I knew. But there's nothing I can do.

Noble Sister:
If I went up there right now, Carle would just tell me to leave.

Enciodes:
......

Noble Sister:
I know this is shameful Enciodes, but... I- I want you to help my brother!

Enciodes:
He's already refused my help.

Noble Sister:
If he were only after the ransom, I wouldn't have risked myself to come here, so... I don't want you to misunderstand him.

Noble Sister:
But, you've always been ever so reliable, and there is no one else I can turn to, so please!

Enciodes:
I'll do what I can.

Noble Sister:
As you said, I was, in fact, the one to bring up the kidnapping plan.

Noble Sister:
And ever since my 'kidnapping', I've been living with my brother and the other Infected.

Noble Sister:
While I dare not say that I completely understand their plight, I have at least some idea of what they're going through.

Noble Sister:
Back then, he plunged a chunk of Originium into his arm, right in front of me and our parents, before rushing out of the house.

Noble Sister:
It took two years to find him again in the slums, completely by chance.

Noble Sister:
His impetuous temper from before had turned violent, as you've seen, but to me, the biggest change in him was that––

Noble Sister:
Even though he's alive, he doesn't seem to be living.

Noble Sister:
Sorry, I'm not sure how exactly to describe it...

Noble Sister:
He's gotten himself battered and bruised so many times for the sake of his friends, but he doesn't seem to care.

Noble Sister:
And as you saw just now, he'll grovel and denigrate himself without a second thought as long as it's for the sake of others.

Noble Sister:
The only person he doesn't care about is himself.

Enciodes:
......

Noble Sister:
It's the same with the kidnapping, really...

Noble Sister:
Yes...

Infected Brother:
Kate...?

Noble Sister:
Oh no, Carle...

Infected Brother:
Enciodes too, and even Hood...? Y-You saw everything?

Infected Brother:
Did you bring them here, Kate?

Noble Sister:
No, I swear.

Enciodes:
We followed you.

Infected Brother:
Lords these days. How easily they admit to tailing people, hah!

Enciodes:
Carle.

Infected Brother:
I already told you, there's nothing you can do for me.

Enciodes:
......

Infected Brother:
So just stay up there in your ivory tower. You shouldn't feel even a pang of conscience over a pathetic existence like mine.

Infected Brother:
It's better this way. For you and me both.

Infected Brother:
Let's go, Kate.

Noble Sister:
Umm...

Noble Sister:
I'm sorry, Enciodes.

Enciodes:
......

Guard Operator:
Doctor, I brought what you asked for.

Enciodes:
......

Guard Operator:
......

Guard Operator:
Oh, were you asking me?

Guard Operator:
Well, I've been basically watching over you in secret this whole time, so I more or less saw the whole thing.

Guard Operator:
And I do have an opinion on it. Since you asked, maybe you can tell me if I'm right.

Guard Operator:
The ransom is only part of what this Carle guy is after.

Guard Operator:
He does want it, but not for himself. It's for the other Infected who've gathered at his side.

Guard Operator:
Meanwhile, he doesn't really care what happens to himself.

Guard Operator:
He used to be nobility, a young lord. But after infecting himself, he's lived in the city as a beggar for years.

Guard Operator:
Falling from such a great height has only highlighted the oppression of the Infected for him.

Guard Operator:
Because before all that, he may well have been one of the oppressors.

Guard Operator:
From another perspective, the death of his loved one made him choose the most irrational, impulsive method of exacting revenge on his father.

Guard Operator:
And the consequences of that not only banished him to the streets, but also drove his father to ratchet up the oppression.

Guard Operator:
That has always been a source of the contradiction in his heart.

Guard Operator:
So I think what he really wants comes after he gets the ransom.

Guard Operator:
As for his specific plans... Well, the lives of normal people mean little to him, let alone the lives of our Infected.

Guard Operator:
So I'm guessing either murder or suicide.

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
Doctor, that's the direction of Carle's camp.

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
That being the case, I suppose this is where we part ways for now.

Enciodes:
There is one thing I'd like to apologize to you for.

Enciodes:
I should have stayed out of this after I took on the role of an intermediary and passed the commission on to Rhodes Island.

Enciodes:
But it would appear that the situation has changed.

Enciodes:
I'll admit, even when you got involved in Kjerag, I didn't feel as restricted as I do now.

Enciodes:
You are reminding me to answer a question that I've been avoiding for over a year.

Enciodes:
I must ask you once more, just how important is this question for you, Dr. {@nickname}?

Enciodes:
In that case, I'm afraid I have no choice but to produce my answer.

Enciodes:
Just as I have my own methods.

Enciodes:
......

Three days later

Infected Brother:
To be honest, Doctor, even now I find it hard to believe that you're the one from Rhodes Island who saved all those Infected.

Infected Brother:
I always thought you were just a legend.

Infected Brother:
What I find even harder to believe though is that you came here with Enciodes.

Infected Brother:
...Haha, true. It really does.

Infected Brother:
I really hated that guy, back in the day.

Infected Brother:
But there was nothing in particular I hated about him. I was just jealous.

Infected Brother:
I still am.

Infected Brother:
Setting everything else aside though, I'm willing to place my trust in you, Doctor.

Infected Brother:
So, if something happens to me... I'd like you to take care of Kate and my brothers.

Infected Brother:
Enciodes? What are you doing here?!

Enciodes:
Did you really think that Viscount Walden would risk coming out to this barren wasteland to cut a deal in person?

Infected Brother:
What the—?!

Enciodes:
The Viscount has authorized me to serve as his agent in this transaction.

Infected Brother:
He... This is his flesh-and-blood daughter we're talking about! How could he... How dare he!

Enciodes:
You were the one who kidnapped his daughter. What right do you have to judge his decisions?

Infected Brother:
Good... Great! This is just perfect!

Infected Brother:
If that's what you want... fine! Someone, bring out the hostage!

Noble Sister:
Carle...

Infected Brother:
The money for the girl.

Infected Brother:
Have your people put the box in the middle, then we'll release the girl.

Enciodes:
No objections.

Infected Brother:
Go, Kate.

Infected Brother:
(*whispers*) Go back to where you belong.

Noble Sister:
Carle... *sobs*...

Enciodes:
It seems the exchange was successful.

Infected Underling:
We've got the box, boss!

Infected Brother:
If everything's there, then hurry up and run!

Infected Underling:
Huh?

Infected Brother:
Do you seriously think the Viscount would let us go?

Infected Brother:
Isn't that right, Enciodes?

Infected Underling:
Tch... Run, brothers, hurry!

Guard Operator:
What do we do, Doctor?

Caster Operator:
Attacking one of the Viscount's guards would spell serious trouble... But are we just going to stand by and watch?

Enciodes:
I thought you'd let them run a bit further ahead of time.

Infected Brother:
I needed to make sure they got their money. Plus, with their skills, if I let them run away first, you'd just hold them up to threaten me.

Enciodes:
'Make sure that they got their money'... In other words, you never planned on leaving here alive, correct?

Infected Brother:
......

Infected Brother:
Alive?

Infected Brother:
What does it mean to be alive, Enciodes?

Infected Brother:
Does having a heartbeat count as being alive?

Infected Brother:
Or is being alive watching your loved one's body get dragged away like an old rag?

Infected Brother:
Or watching other people die in front of your eyes because they can't get medicine?

Infected Brother:
I don't know how to be alive anymore. All I know is how I want to die.

Infected Brother:
It was supposed to be me and the old man dying here today.

Infected Brother:
I would've told him that his son still lives. Then I would've killed him, and then myself.

Infected Brother:
That's all I wanted. My one and only desire.

Infected Brother:
So why did you have to stomp out the embers of even that last little bit of desire?

Enciodes:
You rejected my help, so I can only resolve this using my own methods.

Infected Brother:
Haha... that's right. That's exactly the kind of person you are.

Enciodes:
Also, I can assure you of at least one thing. The Viscount already knows.

Enciodes:
The look of horror on his face when he heard his son was still alive was positively brilliant.

Infected Brother:
Hoping I'll die slightly more at peace?

Enciodes:
Indeed, that was my intent.

Infected Brother:
Then I've changed my mind, Enciodes. I'll kill you, then I'll kill the old man.

Enciodes:
And what about after that?

Infected Brother:
We'll see when we get there!

Infected Brother:
Die for me!

Infected Brother:
?!

Enciodes:
You've woken up.

Infected Brother:
You... Why...

Infected Brother:
......

Infected Brother:
Why didn't you kill me? Out of pity?

Enciodes:
Carle, when you said that there was nothing I could do for you, what you really meant was that I don't understand the plight of the Infected.

Enciodes:
And I must admit, that is true.

Enciodes:
As I was returning to the Viscount, the Doctor asked me a question.

Enciodes:
What would I use to bargain for your life?

Enciodes:
I thought about it for a long time. I didn't want to answer with words like revenge, hope, or the future.

Enciodes:
Finally, I reached my conclusion.

Enciodes:
I will use the lives of all of your friends to save yours.

Infected Brother:
What?!

Enciodes:
As of now, all of them in this city have already died. Including you.

Enciodes:
Next, they will move to one of my branch offices in a neighboring city and begin a new life there.

Enciodes:
The same goes for you. Of course, if you have any objections, I will respect your wishes.

Infected Brother:
They... aren't dead?

Enciodes:
The people chasing them are my men.

Infected Brother:
Ha... Haha... You bastard... How arrogant can you get?

Enciodes:
I won't deny it.

Enciodes:
You don't need to worry about the Viscount. The only problem is your sister... I'm very sorry, but you two will have to be separated.

Infected Brother:
I wouldn't have gone to see her even without your arrangement.

Infected Brother:
She's better off forgetting about this good-for-nothing brother of hers.

Infected Brother:
But... give me some time. To think it over.

Enciodes:
You have all the time in the world.

Enciodes:
Doctor.

Enciodes:
Flawless.

Enciodes:
True.

Enciodes:
This commission was originally my way of apologizing to you, but as it turns out, now I owe you an even bigger favor.

Enciodes:
Also, I failed to help you establish a connection to Viscount Walden.

Enciodes:
Truly, a series of uncharacteristic gaffes on my part.

Enciodes:
Regardless, this incident has provided me with a novel perspective on certain matters.

Enciodes:
Give me some time, Doctor, and I will pay you back in a way that satisfies you.

Kal'tsit:
I've finished reading the report.

Kal'tsit:
In terms of outcomes, this was a resounding failure. Not only did we fail to establish a relationship with Viscount Walden, we might even be blacklisted by him now.

Kal'tsit:
Therefore we no longer have the option of using his network to find a stopover point for Rhodes Island.

Kal'tsit:
I wasn't finished.

Kal'tsit:
But from the standpoint of Rhodes Island, you made the correct choice.

Kal'tsit:
You shouldn't, as you've done nothing that warrants regret.

Kal'tsit:
Rhodes Island has no desire to be involved with that sort of nobleman anyway, unless absolutely necessary.

Kal'tsit:
I might have taken an even more decisive approach.

Kal'tsit:
Although I won't deny that the results would probably be similar.

Kal'tsit:
Besides, we didn't walk away from this commission empty-handed.

Kal'tsit:
Although even I cannot predict what effects this will bring about down the road.

While speaking, Kal'tsit pulls out a document from the archive's sky-high pile of papers and hands it over.

It looks to be a temporary operator cooperation request. The operator in question calls himself SilverAsh.

Enciodes.

Kal'tsit:
This arrived just yesterday.

Kal'tsit:
You can imagine the HR Department's confusion when he requested to join Rhodes Island as an operator.

Kal'tsit:
In the end, I was forced to handle the situation in person, and to cut straight to the result—

Kal'tsit:
He accepted all the conditions I laid out for him, and passed the operator exam with flying colors.

Kal'tsit:
He's waiting for you in the reception room right now. You should give him a tour of Rhodes Island while you're there.

Enciodes:
Ensia has been receiving treatment here while working as an operator. As her older brother, naturally I was concerned and decided to follow suit.

Enciodes:
Is there something wrong with that?

Enciodes:
That's right.

Enciodes:
This is the end result of a thorough deliberation.

Enciodes:
Using my clan name as my code name is easy to remember, no?

Enciodes:
Carle accepted my offer. Rest assured, no one will know where he or his friends ended up.

Enciodes:
Speaking of which, the new monitoring bracelet you gave me is much better than the previous one.

Enciodes:
I'm interested in purchasing a batch myself.

Enciodes:
Perhaps we can sit down to discuss it.

Enciodes:
Are you asking why I signed that lopsided contract Madam Kal'tsit drafted?

Enciodes:
That is simply a price I'm willing to pay to become a member of Rhodes Island.

Enciodes:
No need to be so pushy.

Enciodes:
If I had any ulterior motives, I wouldn't be going through all this, now would I?

Enciodes:
Surely someone as smart as you would be able to guess the reason?

Enciodes:
No need to be so diplomatic. 'You don't belong here.'

Enciodes:
I must admit, this is a rather bold experiment, even for my tastes.

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
I want to be your friend, {@nickname}.

Enciodes:
I have plenty of business partners, subordinates, competitors, and enemies. What I'm missing is—

Enciodes:
A friend.

Enciodes:
I trust we've already reached a tacit understanding, to some degree.

Enciodes:
But understanding between individuals is always asymmetric, which is why I do not trust tacit understandings, Doctor.

Enciodes:
The best way to know what someone else is thinking will always be to ask them directly, no?

Enciodes:
Such as?

Enciodes:
Enya is doing superbly right now. Better than I could have imagined.

Enciodes:
We did reach a mutual understanding, in a sense, but that is precisely the reason we were able to clearly see each others' choices.

Enciodes:
All I can say is she would be a very suitable partner, but not a friend.

Enciodes:
I realize that Ensia is no longer a child. She has keen insight into a variety of matters.

Enciodes:
I will give her everything she wants, and respect her opinions.

Enciodes:
But there are far more things I cannot tell her than things I can.

Enciodes:
Gnosis seems to have already made quite a name for himself in your lab, thanks to his talent and personality. He may be knowledgeable about many things, but that is a product of the years we spent together.

Enciodes:
He is not someone I can share anything with, and he understands that better than I do.

Enciodes:
Degenbrecher and I are on sublime terms, and it is true that she has great insight in many areas.

Enciodes:
The thing is, she doesn't care. She deliberately keeps herself uninvolved in most affairs. From her perspective, much of what I do is merely inviting trouble for myself.

Enciodes:
And I can't deny that.

Enciodes:
Matterhorn and Weiss... I trust them implicitly, and feel comfortable handing them many responsibilities.

Enciodes:
While I won't say that our relationship as superior and subordinate creates a distance between us, realistically speaking we will always have a hard time reaching a mutual understanding. As the giver and recipient of trust.

Enciodes:
So, as you can see...

Enciodes:
I can share bits and pieces of myself with each of the people you mentioned.

Enciodes:
But for various reasons, I cannot share everything with them, just as they cannot share everything with me.

Enciodes:
I never wanted to.

Enciodes:
Just as nobody asked me if I wanted to become head of the clan that year.

Enciodes:
I've grown accustomed to weighing the value of each and every person I encounter, and designating a role for them on my path to progress.

Enciodes:
Within the spheres I have designated for them, I am completely genuine.

Enciodes:
But nobody can claim it all.

Enciodes:
Correct.

Enciodes:
At the core of my enterprise is the land of Kjerag, to the point that all the people I find around me are intimately connected to the land itself.

Enciodes:
Most of the time, this isn't a bad thing.

Enciodes:
However, I have realized that I am lacking an objective viewpoint who can criticize or discuss matters concerning myself.

Enciodes:
......

Enciodes:
Enya and Ensia were still very young when our parents suddenly passed away.

Enciodes:
The family's heavy responsibilities fell completely onto my shoulders. For both my sisters and the clan, I could only grit my teeth and pick up the mantle as a Silverash.

Enciodes:
After a few years of this, I realized that nothing would ever change from simply remaining the head of a clan in Kjerag.

Enciodes:
So I left to study in Victoria, following in my father's footsteps.

Enciodes:
What happened during my time abroad would make a fascinating topic for another time, should you be interested.

Enciodes:
But judging from the results, I made the correct decision. If I hadn't left, I would never have understood what Kjerag needed, nor what challenges it would face.

Enciodes:
A few years later, I voluntarily ended my studies and returned with my capital and connections to form Karlan Trade.

Enciodes:
I'll admit the whole process was originally meant to take much longer. While abroad, most of my time was dedicated to studying and networking, though it is not as if I didn't have moments of leisure as well.

Enciodes:
Unfortunately though, the alarm bells ringing in my heart pushed me to make my decision early.

Enciodes:
What comes after is the history of Karlan Trade's development.

Enciodes:
I cannot claim full credit for our achievements, but I have indeed put everything I have into it, and into the land.

Enciodes:
It seems that we share a propensity to tease others.

Enciodes:
I won't say I've grown weary, but I've never been one to fail to understand the importance of relaxation.

Enciodes:
If I were only here because I needed someone to talk to... then I would lack the qualifications to be your friend.

Enciodes:
Correct.

Enciodes:
People like us would never say that hard work alone makes efforts worth acknowledging, nor would we use it as an excuse.

Enciodes:
Quite the contrary. I want to share what I've experienced in my life with someone worthy of my recognition.

Enciodes:
I originally thought that our cooperation would remain on a business level, but you seemed to insist that your business is inseparably connected to all of us.

Enciodes:
And you've managed to convince me.

Enciodes:
Kjerag has experienced hardly any Catastrophes in the past, and as such, the people of Kjerag have little innate prejudice against the Infected.

Enciodes:
That said, the role they play in society, what they've experienced, what they will experience...

Enciodes:
I must admit, I had failed to adequately consider these things.

Enciodes:
When I issued articles of incorporation modeled after Victoria's statutes, all I had in mind were some commonplace management tricks.

Enciodes:
But not enough to become your friend, now is it?

Enciodes:
But if were to become friends, you would have that privilege.

Enciodes:
I need to gain a deeper understand of the Infected, and of Rhodes Island's business.

Enciodes:
You've helped me realize that this isn't important just for Karlan Trade, but for the way I view this world.

Enciodes:
And after getting to know you, the simplest way to achieve this seems to be to work with you and Rhodes Island.

Enciodes:
Which is why I became SilverAsh.

Enciodes:
Or, put more simply, friends need to see each other every once in a while, don't they?

Enciodes:
I've grown accustomed to dealing with others as a transaction, where one party provides something of value and the other reciprocates with equal value, neither side owing anything to the other.

Enciodes:
But friendship, family, and love cannot be assigned a value.

Enciodes:
As such, I must choose my partners carefully.

Enciodes:
I'll be staying here for a few days, so we'll have plenty of time for that.

Enciodes:
Perhaps you will be able to glean some of the secrets of the Victorian nobility from the vignettes I share with you.

Enciodes:
Obviously. If a third party were present for this conversation, they would quickly discover—

Enciodes:
That I did not come here to 'establish' a friendship at all, but simply to have a chat with a friend.

Enciodes:
If that's the case, then the same must be true for you.

Enciodes:
Alright, Doctor, you're still responsible for showing me around the landship.

Enciodes:
We can talk more along the way.

Enciodes:
One more thing.

Enciodes:
I'll admit that doing things this way may have come as a surprise. Perhaps even caused you some trouble.

Enciodes:
But the next time you see me, you should be glad.

Enciodes:
After all, nobody is better suited to solve your problems than me. Isn't that right?
