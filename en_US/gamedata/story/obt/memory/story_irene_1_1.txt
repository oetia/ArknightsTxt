Ashen skies. Strong winds. Untamed wilds. Somber graves.

This is the final resting place for all High Inquisitors.

Inquisitor Irene:
......

Irene still remembers the sight, from the first time her master brought her here.

What she dared not tell him at the time was that it had made her heart burn with a zealous sense of purpose. That to her, their sacrifice was something to be glorified.

That she had felt as if the entire graveyard was shrouded in a hallowed beauty.

Inquisitor Irene:
(It's so beautiful...)

High Inquisitor Dario:
Irene.

Inquisitor Irene:
Oh! Y-Yes, Maestro!

High Inquisitor Dario:
Seeing as you've chosen to become my deputy, then starting today, I am not just your teacher, but also your superior officer.

Inquisitor Irene:
Yes, sir!

High Inquisitor Dario:
This is where my mentor brought me when I first became an Inquisitor.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Most of the graves here are cenotaphs. After all, not many in our line of work are recovered in one piece when we die.

High Inquisitor Dario:
So rather than their bodies, their lanterns and weapons better represent the trail they've cleared in life.

High Inquisitor Dario:
As such, we place them here on the graves of every Inquisitor to fall in battle, to serve as a memorial.

High Inquisitor Dario:
And these nine tombstones... are for the nine Saints.

Inquisitor Irene:
Nine? But isn't your master, Lord Carmen, still alive?

High Inquisitor Dario:
While the other eight have long since perished on their journey, Lord Carmen has already designated this as his final resting place.

Inquisitor Irene:
......

Inquisitor Irene:
(How wonderful would it be if I could give my life defending Iberia and be buried here too.)

High Inquisitor Dario:
Irene.

Inquisitor Irene:
Yes, sir!

High Inquisitor Dario:
One day, you will also bring my lantern and weapon here, to lay them to rest.

Inquisitor Irene:
......

High Inquisitor Dario:
I can only hope that when that day comes, you will not grieve, but rather have understood what we fight for.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Because by then, nobody will be left to instruct you.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Until that day, though, I will teach you everything I know.

Irene remembers answering with a resounding 'Yes, sir!'

But at the time, she did not understand the weight of her master's words, nor the weight of a life.

She did not understand. Not until after everything she experienced on the Stultifera, not until she was carrying her master's tools with her to lay upon his grave.

Inquisitor Irene:
There are more graves here now.

Irene arrives in front of one.

'Here sleeps High Inquisitor Dario.'

A simple wooden plaque. A single, unassuming sentence, with no embellishments. The grave of a High Inquisitor.

Lest she disturb his soul, she gingerly places what he left behind on his grave, before slowly sitting down.

Inquisitor Irene:
Maestro, I've brought your lantern. I've brought your weapon.

Inquisitor Irene:
As you requested, I've returned them to your grave, so that your soul may return to your homeland.

Inquisitor Irene:
But, even though I made that promise back then, I never thought the day would come so soon.

Inquisitor Irene:
While it's been some time since it happened, I still can't believe that you're no longer with us.

Inquisitor Irene:
But in the end, you're gone.

Inquisitor Irene:
There will be nobody to scold me for being childish. Nobody to warn me to think more, to observe more. Nobody to shelter me from the wind and the rain.

Inquisitor Irene:
...Never mind. If you could hear me now, I'm sure you'd just chide me for being soft and weak.

Inquisitor Irene:
Don't worry. I still remember what you said. That you hoped I would understand what we are fighting for.

Inquisitor Irene:
I think I do now. At least somewhat.

Inquisitor Irene:
So... I might not be back to visit you for a while.

Inquisitor Irene:
Not because I've lost faith in my beliefs.

Inquisitor Irene:
If anything, I'm doing this because I now truly understand the meaning of 'inquisition.'

Inquisitor Irene:
I hope you can continue to watch over me, Maestro.

Inquisitor Irene:
Lord Carmen?!

Saint Carmen:
No need to be so nervous. I am nothing more than a teacher, come to see his fallen student.

Inquisitor Irene:
......

Saint Carmen:
Those items you placed belonged to Dario, no?

Inquisitor Irene:
Y-Yes. While it didn't need to be me who brought them here, I wanted to do it myself.

Inquisitor Irene:
He was my maestro after all, and... I wanted to tell him goodbye.

Saint Carmen:
Oh?

Inquisitor Irene:
......

The person standing before her eyes is a High Inquisitor crowned with the title of Saint. Every Inquisitor knows of the countless trials Saint Carmen has overcome, and of the countless evils he has passed his judgment on.

His existence itself is the embodiment of the Inquisition's will.

For a moment, she regrets the decision she has made, but quickly suppresses that thought.

She made up her mind long ago.

Inquisitor Irene:
I handed in my resignation before coming here.

Inquisitor Irene:
I plan to step down from my position as Inquisitor. So, I wanted to say goodbye to my maestro before I leave the Inquisition.

Saint Carmen:
......

Irene had already prepared answers to the questions she was sure would come, but is met only with the Saint's silence.

She dares not speculate what this silence implies, but does not sense any anger from him.

Saint Carmen:
Dario was my eighth student, and the finest of them all.

Saint Carmen:
But he was never very good with words, and wasn't particularly popular even among the Inquisitors. He never stopped calling me 'Lord' either, even though I was his teacher.

Saint Carmen:
It must not have been easy being his student.

Inquisitor Irene:
That's not true.

Inquisitor Irene:
Maestro always acted swiftly and decisively. I admired that about him, and the results proved again and again that he was always correct.

Saint Carmen:
Only thanks to the many, many mistakes he made when he was younger.

A fleeting illusion flashes across Irene's mind—that the person in front of her is not a strict and stolid Saint, but rather a weary old man.

Saint Carmen:
Had I accompanied him to the Eye of Iberia, he would likely not have given his life.

Inquisitor Irene:
...Aboard that golden ship, when that monster told me news of his passing, she told me that his death was meaningless.

Inquisitor Irene:
So I responded: 'the Inquisition never makes sacrifices in vain.'

Inquisitor Irene:
But before he died, he once taught me that the notion of a good death was nothing but a romanticization.

Inquisitor Irene:
That for us Inquisitors, the only way we can fulfill our ideals is by living on.

Inquisitor Irene:
So before considering whether his death was meaningful or not, it would've been better had he survived. That's what I've been thinking.

Saint Carmen:
Dario taught you well.

Saint Carmen:
......

Saint Carmen:
After the calamity swept over Iberia, the other Saints and I gradually grew the Inquisition into what it is now.

Saint Carmen:
We achieved a great number of things, most of which can be read in the Scriptures.

Saint Carmen:
But sometimes, I've been forced to ask the very same question: had I acted differently, could I have prevented someone's death? Countless deaths?

Saint Carmen:
Ultimately, I am but one man. Even if different choices could have allowed me to do so much more, they too might've resulted in yet more death.

Inquisitor Irene:
In other words, there's only so much one person can do.

Saint Carmen:
Surely you're not resigning because you're disillusioned in the direction the Inquisition is going?

Inquisitor Irene:
Of course not... I didn't expect you to see through me so easily, though.

Saint Carmen:
Had that been the case, you would've shied away from me after you returned from the Stultifera.

Saint Carmen:
But you didn't.

Saint Carmen:
Your convictions now are even purer than when I first saw you in Gran Faro.

Saint Carmen:
What reason would I have to suspect you of running away?

Inquisitor Irene:
But...

Saint Carmen:
I still remember a few years back, when Dario told me that he would take his first student. A young child.

Saint Carmen:
For the survival of the organization, each High Inquisitor must select a few students from among the Inquisitors, and pass down everything they have learned.

Saint Carmen:
However, it is extremely rare for one to choose a child.

Inquisitor Irene:
The Scriptures saved my life, but had Maestro not been there, I may well have still died in those ruins.

Inquisitor Irene:
After that, I was taken to the Inquisition's orphanage, and he occasionally came to see me from then on.

Inquisitor Irene:
...It's not as if he became my maestro right away. Actually, as a High Inquisitor, it was against regulations for him to instruct an orphan like me in the first place.

Inquisitor Irene:
But some time after he found out that I wanted to become an Inquisitor, and had already begun training for it, he suddenly told me that he wanted to personally teach me a few things.

Saint Carmen:
Oh?

Inquisitor Irene:
His decision always puzzled me too, so I eventually found an opportunity to ask him about it. I'll never forget what he said.

High Inquisitor Dario:
You want to know why I decided to take you as my student?

Inquisitor Irene:
That's right.

High Inquisitor Dario:
Because your zealotry for the Inquisition, the Scriptures, and the Law reached my ears.

Inquisitor Irene:
Really?!

High Inquisitor Dario:
And that is your fatal flaw.

Inquisitor Irene:
Huh?

High Inquisitor Dario:
Your justice comes from the texts that saved you, from the Inquisition that raised you, from your own studies in your path to becoming an Inquisitor.

High Inquisitor Dario:
But it leaves little room for the sights witnessed with your own two eyes, the words heard by your own two ears, or the ground tread by your own two feet.

High Inquisitor Dario:
You are still too fragile, Irene.

Inquisitor Irene:
I didn't understand him at the time, and he wasn't willing to say anything more, so I always just kept his words in the back of my mind.

Inquisitor Irene:
I never understood what he meant, until now.

Inquisitor Irene:
He feared that I would be blinded by justice, hurt by zealotry, and slain too soon by truth.

Inquisitor Irene:
Because I was so convinced that the contents of the Scriptures and the Law made me who I am.

Saint Carmen:
So, you began to wonder if there are limitations to our laws.

Inquisitor Irene:
No, I'm still convinced that the Law is effective.

Saint Carmen:
Then you want to say that the distinction we make between good and evil lacks nuance.

Inquisitor Irene:
No, I believe that our codes are tried and true.

Saint Carmen:
In that case, why are you leaving the Inquisition?

Inquisitor Irene:
Maestro once told me that when the time comes, I must become Iberia's last line of defense.

Inquisitor Irene:
I used to think he expected too much of me, but now I see that this was the least he could have hoped for.

Inquisitor Irene:
It wasn't because of any special talent of mine, or because I'm to fulfill some kind of unique duty.

Inquisitor Irene:
It was because he expected the same of himself, and he did just that.

Inquisitor Irene:
So as his student, it was only natural that I do the same.

Inquisitor Irene:
Everything I learned on the Stultifera, everything he ever taught me, was all to help me to come to one realization—

Inquisitor Irene:
That the Scriptures and the Law will guide my actions, but my actions must first abide by my own ideals.

Inquisitor Irene:
I must first understand myself. Have faith in myself. Only then will the Scriptures and the Law truly grant me strength. Only then will my lantern truly strike fear into the sea monsters.

Inquisitor Irene:
I witnessed the truth in the cage beneath the Inquisition. And on the Stultifera, I learned of their thoughts, their language, and... their evolution.

Inquisitor Irene:
I have seen our enemies clearly, and now understand the imminent crisis we face.

Inquisitor Irene:
I have traveled with the Hunters, and fought alongside them. I have seen their pride, but also the extent of their strength.

Inquisitor Irene:
They are unknowns, but we need not fear them.

Saint Carmen:
So, my child, after everything you've experienced, what is the answer you've arrived at?

Irene:
When I came face-to-face with those monsters, it became immediately clear that what I suspected was what Maestro also suspected. That what I feared was what he also feared.

Irene:
My justice could not endure the trial I faced, and my maestro's conviction was the result of thorough consideration.

Irene:
I will no longer doubt, hesitate, or run. I will do what I can do. What I must do.

Saint Carmen:
......

Irene:
Oh, I'm sorry, Lord Carmen. I should've chosen my words more carefully.

Irene:
But please believe me. I'm stepping down only so that I can better carry out my duties as an Inquisitor.

Saint Carmen:
The position of Inquisitor is an extremely sensitive one. Only by relinquishing it are you able to work with other organizations, or even countries.

Saint Carmen:
Child, you've witnessed the light of multilateralism.

Saint Carmen:
So what will you do after parting ways with the Inquisition?

Irene:
I'll try to work with the three Abyssal Hunters for the time being.

Irene:
They seem to have close ties to that Rhodes Island organization, so I am considering whether or not to reach out to them.

Saint Carmen:
Hmm, if that's the case...

Saint Carmen:
Did you hear all that, Kal'tsit?

Irene:
Huh?!

Kal'tsit:
Sorry, but the conversation had gotten so interesting that I couldn't help but stop and listen in.

Irene:
Ugh...

Kal'tsit:
Naturally, Rhodes Island would never refuse the assistance of such a capable Inquisitor.

Saint Carmen:
Irene, you can step down without leaving the Inquisition altogether, you know.

Irene:
Huh?

Saint Carmen:
You can become our Messenger to Rhodes Island, and cooperate with them on our behalf.

Irene:
Really?

Saint Carmen:
Remember, Irene. Your decision today will be the next step in Ægir's partnership with Iberia.

Irene:
...Yes, sir!

Saint Carmen:
Good. Get ready to set off then.

Saint Carmen:
Nobody will be there to guide you on your new journey. Only the faith in your heart can show you where to go.

Irene:
Yes, sir!

Saint Carmen:
......

Saint Carmen:
See, Kal'tsit?

Saint Carmen:
For me, the opportunity for Ægir and Iberia to rejoin hands came far, far too late.

Saint Carmen:
Even if they've given us an opportunity to turn things around, time has taken its toll on me, and I can no longer feel even the slightest bit of joy from it.

Saint Carmen:
But for her, it truly is the dawn of a new day.

Kal'tsit:
If their evolution is the instinct of life itself, then the decision she made just now must surely be the instinct of civilization.

Kal'tsit:
...Hm?

Saint Carmen:
What are you looking at?
