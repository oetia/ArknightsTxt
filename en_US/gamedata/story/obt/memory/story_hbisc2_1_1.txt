Andante:
Hibiscus!

Andante:
Where are you!

Injured Boy:
My leg... it hurts...

Hibiscus:
It's ok. Stay still, and let me have a look.

Hibiscus:
It's just a bruise. No bleeding or fractures. I'll rub some salve on it and you'll be fine.

Injured Boy:
But it hurts so much when I try to move...

Hibiscus:
I know how it feels. I hurt my leg once when I was little. It really hurt, and I was bleeding and scared. I couldn't stop crying.

Hibiscus:
But you're not crying. That means you're a strong boy, aren't you?

Injured Boy:
(Rubs eyes)

Hibiscus:
But it's not gonna get better by itself if you sit here like this.

Hibiscus:
Would you rather sit in the cold and the rain, or go home and get better on your warm and comfy bed?

Injured Boy:
I, I...

Hibiscus:
Come, take my hand, and stand up. Good. Can you go home by yourself?

Injured Boy:
Yes!

Hibiscus:
Good boy. Now go on home; your mum and dad are waiting.

Injured Boy:
Thank you!

Andante:
Hibiscus!

Andante:
What happened at the concert, Hibiscus? Why are you here by yourself?

Hibiscus:
Andante... perfect timing.

Hibiscus:
No time to explain. I just patched up a few injuries here.

Hibiscus:
But Originium levels are very high around here. Take them to the office for a closer look...

Andante:
What the heck are you talking about?!

Andante:
What's with all those wounds on you? You're in no shape to help anybody!

Hibiscus:
Wounds? What are you—

Old Man:
Young lady, why do you—

Hibiscus:
I'll hold down the fort here, Ebenholz. Now!

Hibiscus:
It can't be. I thought I blocked it...

Hibiscus:
Don't worry, I learned a few things from Lava. I know some Ar—

Andante:
Hibiscus!

A few days ago...

Hibiscus:
Hello, this is the medical assistance center. Is this the number of Mr. Darron?

Sickly Man:
It's you... where's Andante?

Hibiscus:
Dr. Andante is out visiting patients, so I'm checking on you on her behalf. Don't worry, I received the same professional training.

Hibiscus:
May I come in to do a few checks? Just some basic tests. No blood will be drawn—

Sickly Man:
Stay away from my house!

Hibiscus:
I won't come near without your permission.

Hibiscus:
But you do not sound well. You should get yourself checked up—

Sickly Man:
It's none of your business!

Sickly Man:
I was feeling perfectly fine until you came to the Afterglow, Sarkaz!

Sickly Man:
The prophecies were right! You Sarkaz have brought calamity upon the Afterglow!

Hibiscus:
It's a complicated situation, and hard to explain... but you need help, and your health should come first.

Sickly Man:
Enough! I'm not gonna grovel to a Sarkaz, even on my deathbed.

Hibiscus:
Very well, I won't force you, if you don't want to get checked up.

Hibiscus:
Here's some medicine that may help... please don't consider it help from a Sarkaz. I'm simply delivering medicine to those in need, on behalf of Rhodes Island.

Hibiscus:
I'll leave the medicine at the door. You can pick it up at your convenience.

Sickly Man:
Go away... or I'll call the guards.

Hibiscus:
Sorry... I'll be going.

Hibiscus:
I've gone through the Afterglow. Based on the number of Infected who have recovered abnormally, we don't have enough supplies at the office to deal with a crisis.

Hibiscus:
Why hasn't the medicine we ordered come in? I hope that patient doesn't waste the doses...

???:
Hibiscus—

Hibiscus:
...What?

As though hearing a call from afar, Hibiscus turns around, but finds no one there.

Every door and window is closed, as though the scenes of song and dance from a few days ago were merely an illusion.

But the weathered walls and battered tiles look so familiar upon close inspection.

Food Stall Owner:
I asked you to carry ingredients for tomorrow into the warehouse, but I didn't expect you to carry enough to last a week. Aren't you tired?

Hibiscus:
Ha, don't underestimate Sarkaz strength!

Food Stall Owner:
Alright... still, you must be tired. Here, have two servings of fins & chips, and share it with your sister.

Hibiscus:
Thanks, but I think mom has dinner ready. I'll just take one serving and share it with Lava.

Fruit Stall Owner:
See? You shouldn't give a young lady too much fried food.

Fruit Stall Owner:
Here, take this bag of fruit. Guaranteed to be sweet and juicy.

Hibiscus:
Thanks!

Fruit Stall Owner:
You're welcome. I'm counting on you to tutor that little brat of mine!

Hibiscus:
Come on, Hibiscus, focus...

Hibiscus:
I'm back.

Andante:
Why have you gone out again? Didn't I say I would take care of the investigation for a few days?

Hibiscus:
Things in the Afterglow are complicated. I can't just leave it all to you.

Hibiscus:
All I did was deliver some medicine to patients in need. I won't draw any attention.

Andante:
Did anyone bother you...?

Hibiscus:
(Shakes head)

Andante:
Dr. Kal'tsit says a medic's first duty on a field mission is to her own safety.

Andante:
What happened the other day—it was their fault, but you shouldn't have charged ahead like that. It was dangerous.

Hibiscus:
Sorry. I realized afterwards that I should have taken another path... I was angry and anxious, and being right was all I could think of.

Hibiscus:
But thinking back now, there was really no point to an argument like that.

Andante:
Good that you realize your mistake. Next time you put yourself in danger like that, I'm putting it in my report.

Hibiscus:
I'm sure they meant nothing by it. They're just scared after all that's happened lately.

Hibiscus:
I remember being invited to dance my first day in the Afterglow.

Andante:
They probably just mistook you for a Caprinae...

Hibiscus:
I don't think so.

Hibiscus:
I used to think there wasn't much difference between the horn of a Caprinae and that of a Sarkaz, but I recently learned that the Caprinae are able to tell them apart at a glance.

Hibiscus:
Let me tell you something funny.

Hibiscus:
I found a Caprinae girl unconscious by the roadside before I arrived in Vyseheim.

Hibiscus:
I gave her some medicine and water. When she woke up, she recognized me as a Sarkaz and looked scared.

Hibiscus:
I panicked and said, 'Don't worry, I'm a Caprinae too!'

Hibiscus:
She didn't believe me and ran away screaming.

Hibiscus:
It was so funny, now that I think of it. Why would a Sarkaz introduce herself like that?

Andante:
It's not funny at all.

Hibiscus:
Hm...

Hibiscus:
I'll get the door.

Rude Infected:
It's you...?

Rude Infected:
You just left my house! Don't you remember?

Rude Infected:
I'm his son! You sucked my father's blood!

Rude Infected:
I'm looking for Dr. Andante. Where is she?

Andante:
(Gestures 'pretend I'm not here')

Hibiscus:
She's not here right now. I can help, if you need something.

Rude Infected:
Er, I...

Rude Infected:
P-Please help my father!

Hibiscus:
What happened?

Rude Infected:
He was feeling well a few days ago, but things took a bad turn this morning.

Rude Infected:
He's running a high fever, and new crystals are appearing on his skin...

Rude Infected:
Please, help him!

Hibiscus:
Take me to him.

Rude Infected:
Y-You'll do it? Than—

Hibiscus:
No time to talk, let's go.

Sickly Old Man:
(Anguished moaning)

Schneider:
Doktor, will my father—

Hibiscus:
I performed some basic treatment to stabilize his condition. He's out of danger for now. Let him sleep.

Schneider:
Will he get better?

Hibiscus:
I can't give you any false hope.

Schneider:
But why...?

Hibiscus:
As is the case with many others in the Afterglow, your father's condition is a type of 'false recovery.'

Hibiscus:
The body draws on undamaged organs to fill in for functions that have been damaged, but this is only a stop-gap measure.

Hibiscus:
Your father is now undergoing the rebound that follows a false recovery. His age only compounds the rapid onset of Oripathy symptoms.

Schneider:
I remember you saying something to the effect.

Schneider:
It's all my fault. If only I had...

Hibiscus:
There's no point regretting the past. The important thing is to take care of your father now.

Hibiscus:
Pay careful attention to his diet, his sleep cycle, and keep his bodily functions in balance. Care is more important than treatment right now.

Schneider:
Alright, I'll do it.

Schneider:
And Dr. Hibiscus... I, I'm sorry about—

Andante:
Are you there, Hibiscus?

Andante:
Something's not right. We need to—

Hibiscus:
Don't disturb the patient. We'll talk outside.

Hibiscus:
What's going on?

Andante:
A dozen patients came into the office right after you left. Some had suddenly lost consciousness, while others experienced a rapid deterioration in vitals.

Andante:
Other patients are also coming in with various symptoms, but we haven't been able to determine if they are Oripathy-related.

Hibiscus:
Mr. Schneider's father was not an isolated case. Many patients who had recovered abnormally are entering the rebound stage.

Hibiscus:
Rhodes Island alone can't take in everyone. Have you asked if the other hospitals can accept patients, or deliver the medicine that we ordered?

Andante:
I have, but they keep finding excuses. And they said...

Andante:
They needed to ensure sufficient medical supplies for the Cliffy Patio.

Hibiscus:
How could they be so irresponsible!

Hibiscus:
Hang in there, Andante. I'm coming back—

Andante:
Calm down, Hibiscus.

Andante:
People are restless right now, and there are many who believe the rumors. This is not the time to show your face.

Hibiscus:
But I can't—

Hibiscus:
......

Hibiscus:
...You're right.

Hibiscus:
Could you take care of things at the office, Andante?

Andante:
Of course. I haven't spent all this time in the Afterglow for nothing.

Schneider:
I'll help!

Hibiscus:
But your father...

Schneider:
The neighbors can care for him for a while. You're short-handed, aren't you?

Schneider:
I can help. Anything you need.

Hibiscus:
Alright, this is the list of patients who recovered abnormally.

Hibiscus:
You know the Afterglow. Check the list and bring the patients who have deteriorated quickly to the office for intensive care.

Schneider:
Got it!

Hibiscus:
I'll take care of the hospitals.

Hibiscus:
I'll convince them.

Panicking Infected:
Doktor! Help me!

Crying Child:
I wanna go home...

The room is packed with several times the normal number of patients.

There is a sickly smell in the air, which is filled with the sounds of crying and moaning.

Schneider:
Ugh, what's this smell... I have the patients, Dr. Andante.

Andante:
There are too many of them. It's far more than the number of abnormal recoveries we recorded.

Andante:
We have our hands full with the cross-infection risk alone.

Hibiscus:
You're right. Panic may be even more dangerous than the disease.

Hibiscus:
The patients don't know their own situations. Whether they're experiencing the rebound or not, Oripathy sufferers believe that their condition is being caused by some unknown threat.

Hibiscus:
The first priority is to identify the cause of the symptoms, and deal with it individually.

Hibiscus:
Patients in the rebound stage experience a rapid decline in bodily functions. In the absence of blood tests, body temperature is the most direct sympt—

Andante:
Hibiscus! Are you alright over there?

Hibiscus:
I... I'm fine.

Hibiscus:
Take care of the office, Andante.

Hibiscus:
I'll get the medicine.

Andante:
Alright, be careful!

Patrol Officer:
Is this the troublemaker?

Private Hospital Doctor:
This is private property, Fräulein. Even members of other medical institutions require permission to enter.

Private Hospital Doctor:
This is your last warning. Leave now.

Hibiscus:
I didn't come to interrupt the work of a fellow medical professional.

Hibiscus:
But how could you talk about not having enough supplies or beds, when a single flu patient could take up enough space for ten people?

Private Hospital Doctor:
We make our decisions based on each patient's unique circumstances...

Leithanian Noble:
S-She's the prophesied devil, isn't she?

Leithanian Noble:
Help! Somebody! Get this Sarkaz out of my room!

Hibiscus:
If I really were the prophesied devil, do you think there's anyone here who could help you?

Leithanian Noble:
Eeek—

Patrol Officer:
No sudden moves!

A dozen wands are aimed at Hibiscus.

Private Hospital Doctor:
Please don't threaten our patients.

Hibiscus:
I'm not threatening anyone. I'm just reminding you, as a fellow doctor, of your moral obligations.

Hibiscus:
The people of the Afterglow are in serious trouble. I only ask that you provide the necessary medicine to the Rhodes Island branch office and take in a number of patients, in accordance with our agreement.

Hibiscus:
Am I asking too much?

Private Hospital Doctor:
Why would I listen to a suspicious foreigner? Everyone knows about the prophecy.

Private Hospital Doctor:
I'm not wasting my time with her. Remove her from the premises, officer.

Hibiscus:
Fine, call me a devil, then.

Hibiscus:
Do you remember what the prophecy that you put so much stock in says?

Hibiscus:
'The Blood hides Plague within, slow beckons Death to creep all Ways.' Where do you think things stand with the Afterglow right now?

Hibiscus:
The prophesied devil stands before you. Take me in, or chase me out. Do whatever you think will protect you.

Hibiscus:
And we'll see how high and mighty the Cliffy Patio fares, when calamity strikes.

Hibiscus:
Mr. Karl—temperatures normal, small increase in blood Originium levels.

Hibiscus:
Mrs. Marta—temperatures normal, blood Originium levels normal.

Andante:
Too many files... too much equipment... I, I can't carry any more...

Andante:
No more health food... I need meat...

Hibiscus:
Looks like she didn't have the time to eat today. She's dreaming about food.

Hibiscus:
Hey, Andante, you're drooling.

Schneider:
Dr. Hibiscus... you're still up?

Hibiscus:
Just filing some patient data. It's not easy for me to go out during the day, so I have to make it up at night.

Hibiscus:
Thanks for helping out today. You should go home.

Schneider:
I... I'll stay here. Here's some water for you.

Hibiscus:
Thank you.

Hibiscus reaches out to take the bottle, but it slips from her hand and rolls across the floor.

Hibiscus:
Sorry... I'll get it.

Schneider:
Are you okay?

Hibiscus:
I'm fine. Just careless.

Schneider:
Ambulances came this afternoon, not long after you left. How did you persuade them?

Hibiscus:
Not exactly with logic and reason, I guess.

Hibiscus:
Anyway, it's good that things have calmed down. The temporary quarantine zone should be lifted tomorrow.

Schneider:
Dr. Hibiscus... I have a question.

Schneider:
You're new here in the Afterglow. It's not like you had time to make friends, and some folk have even treated you terribly. Why are you still willing to...

Hibiscus:
I think this is the first time I've been treated like a doctor.

Schneider:
What?

Hibiscus:
I mostly do the work of a nurse back at HQ, caring for patients and assisting doctors. This is the first time I've been put in charge of things.

Hibiscus:
You call me doctor, so I had better do my job.

Schneider:
You... you'll forgive what I said to you?

Hibiscus:
What if I say no?

Schneider:
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

Schneider:
You can hit me with that flute if you want!

Hibiscus:
I'm just joking. No need to slap yourself.

Hibiscus:
I'm not going to pretend that it didn't bother me at all, but it's understandable.

Hibiscus:
In the face of terrible danger and an unknown threat, it's natural for people to become wary of outsiders.

Schneider:
Do you really think so?

Hibiscus:
And if I just packed up and left, I would really become the prophesied devil who brought disaster to the Afterglow and then disappeared, wouldn't I?

Hibiscus:
Hate leads only to hate, never to understanding.

Hibiscus:
I just hope I can fix people's prejudices with my actions, even just a little bit...

Hibiscus:
Sorry, I wandered off there.

Schneider:
You should get some rest. I'll be over there, and you can call me if you need anything.

Hibiscus:
Whew... things are finally settling down.

Hibiscus:
I should have a sip of water and take a break—

Feeble Patient:
Cough... cough...

Feeble Patient:
Water... I'm thirsty... water...

Hibiscus:
Oh, here's some water for you!

Feeble Patient:
Cough... cough... whew...

Hibiscus:
Feeling better?

Feeble Patient:
A-Are you a Sarkaz?

Hibiscus:
Er... maybe you could treat me as a Caprinae?

Feeble Patient:
Pah, I can tell the horns of a Sarkaz from those of a Caprinae at a sight.

Hibiscus:
Ah, so it's true.

Feeble Patient:
Seeing a Sarkaz under a full moon... am I going to die?

Hibiscus:
I've never heard that legend before.

Feeble Patient:
Ouch, my head hurts. Guess I'm starting to ramble.

Feeble Patient:
Thank you for the care... let's sing a song, whether you're Sarkaz or Caprinae.

Hibiscus:
A song? You should rest up. Your condition has just stabilized.

Feeble Patient:
It's too quiet... we need some music tonight, even if I die tomorrow.

Feeble Patient:
I'll sing. Accompany me with your flute.

Hibiscus:
Very well, if it makes you feel better...

Hibiscus:
But I'm not great at the flute.

Feeble Patient:
It's easy. Just follow my melody.

Feeble Patient:
I'll start. One, two—

Feeble Patient:
The Sky is blue and fine, the Breeze lilts by in Song♪

Feeble Patient:
The River murmurs clear, my Heart is filled with Hope♪...

The alley is quiet, cleared to accommodate the overflow of patients.

The intermittent sounds of flute and singing echo under the moon, a lullaby for a city just emerging from chaos.
