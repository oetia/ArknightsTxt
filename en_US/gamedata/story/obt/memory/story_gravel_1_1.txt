Scary Martin Bar

(Jingle)

Bald Marcin:
Welcome...

Runaway Girl:
Help... help me!

Strange Hunter:
Get back here! Seize her!

Bald Marcin:
Oh, my poor door... only just fixed the day before.

Runaway Girl:
A knight... any knight, please help me...

Strange Hunter:
Hmph, you think a knight's going to save you here?

Strange Hunter:
Look around you! It's just a run-down bar pretending it's got anything to do with knights!

Strange Hunter:
And no knight would never pay you any attention, besides.

Runaway Girl:
Someone, I'm begging you, help me, please... don't let him take me... don't let him sell me!

Strange Hunter:
That's not for you to say. Get an earful of this, bar-goers! 'Chattel' that's already been marked up wants to flee, and wants a knight's help on top of it?

Strange Hunter:
Shout your lungs out for all I care, see who comes to save you! Get over here already!

Runaway Girl:
No, I... I was tricked, I'm not 'chattel' or anything! I didn't want to come to Kazimierz, I want to go home...

Strange Hunter:
Ha-ha. Look at this dumb little girl from a village with no name.

Strange Hunter:
A make-believe story tricked you, that's what. Wanting to go to Kawalerielki to be a knight? And you came right along like an idiot... that's just comedy!

Strange Hunter:
Might as well, while I'm here. Server, I'll have a glass for the road, then I'll take this girl with me, sell her to some old knight as a servant...

Bald Marcin:
Sorry, friend. We don't take too kindly to hunters doing shady business 'round here.

Strange Hunter:
...Come again?

Bald Marcin:
You were saying we don't get knights in here. Selling our little establishment here short, I think. After all, we've got the bigshot, Sir 'Brassrust Knight' Ingra, sitting right here.

Strange Hunter:
B-Brassrust... you mean, THAT Brassrust Knight...!

Brassrust Knight Fan:
(What? Hold on, boss, I only came here to drink. This equipment is just merch...)

Bald Marcin:
(Glare)

Brassrust Knight Fan:
(A—A'ight...)

Brassrust Knight Fan:
'*belch*... *hack*. Rowdy wretch. A piffling dirt-wallowing bounty hunter thinks to cross me?'

Brassrust Knight Fan:
'Out of my sight.'

Strange Hunter:
Grr... hear that? Come with me, before you ruin a major Knight's day!

Bald Marcin:
Psia mać, is there anyone here who can kindly show this villain to the door?

Runaway Girl:
N-No... I don't want to go with...

Runaway Girl:
No, no, I don't want to be someone's servant, I just want to go home... ah!

Strange Hunter:
Do licha, what's the holdup? With me, now...!

Strange Hunter:
Guh... agh...!

Strange Hunter:
Who... *cough*, *hackpth*!

Gravel:
Noisy, noisy~. What's the order of the day in here?

Strange Hunter:
Skurwysyny, sneaky asshole... ggh...!

Gravel:
And who gave you a license to stomp around Kawalerielki like that?

Bald Marcin:
Phew... good we had a helping hand. Would've had a hard time saving the merchandise on my own.

Brassrust Knight Fan:
Is it... over now? B—Being a knight fan sure pays off sometimes, haha...

Bald Marcin:
You're...

Gravel:
What, has Kawalerielki been so quick to forget me?

Gravel:
Marcin, I used to come here quiiiite often.

Bald Marcin:
Your technique... and then your arm here... a 'barcode', is it?

Bald Marcin:
I remember, now... It's you. 'Gravel'. You're a Maypole family Knight.

Runaway Girl:
Gravel... Knight?

Gravel:
You can call me Gravel. It's what I go by, you know. Not any kind of stiffed-up title.

Brassrust Knight Fan:
Knight? *snort*, a Knight attacking her opponent from behind. Using cheap tricks for assassins, too.

Brassrust Knight Fan:
Real knights should be like Sir Ingra, with massive strength, unstoppable force, and a name with the power to drop your guts!

Gravel:
So awkward I have to tell you this, Marcin's customer, but unlike those big stars made of money in the arena, my techniques all come from honest-to-gosh survival.

Brassrust Knight Fan:
You hate the competition knights, is that it? *snort*, all you campaign knights do is drain taxpayer money...

Bald Marcin:
Break it up, break it up.

Bald Marcin:
This hunter boy's not waking up for a while. Lass, you find yourself an escape.

Bald Marcin:
Right, and you haven't thanked Gravel for her bravery.

Runaway Girl:
Th-Thank you so much.

Runaway Girl:
You're that Gravel, then...

Gravel:
Hm? Don't tell me I'm famous.

Runaway Girl:
I've-I've heard about how y-you came to our village once! A lot of bounty hunters operate close by, and it's so far from anywhere else, so the knights barely ever come to help drive them away...

Gravel:
Old stuff, then... I've been to plenty of places, looking for clues. That was all years ago, though.

Gravel:
And you look pretty young. There's no way you could've met me back then... Who are you, hm?

Runaway Girl:
I... I...

Bald Marcin:
She's still in a state of shock. Don't you frighten her. Let her wind down some.

Bald Marcin:
Gravel. Been a long time.

Gravel:
Long time and no see, Marcin. Is the master of the house still regular here these days?

Bald Marcin:
Hah hah, you know he's not crazy for places like this, full of people. Last I heard, he fell in the lake and broke a leg angling, and now it's been an age since he dropped by to try himself some snacks.

Gravel:
Perfect. I'll have a round of what he hasn't eaten.

Bald Marcin:
You're not gonna treat the lass to something?

Gravel:
I'm the girl who saved her life. Why am I paying for her meal on top of it?

Runaway Girl:
G—Gravel, I...

Gravel:
Mmn... fine, you just sit down next to me here. Marcin, I'll have two portions.

Runaway Girl:
Thank you, good Knight...!

Bald Marcin:
So, what've you come back for this time?

Gravel:
I'm just on vacation, seeing how the master of the house's holding up after his dive. Two days before I have to head back.

Bald Marcin:
Back? Back where? You're a Knight of Kazimierz. It's wherever your family's Knight Primus lives that you go on back to.

Gravel:
Hmm? But I've left Kazimierz at this point...

Gekoski:
Where you go, what you do, and who you want to become are all your freedom.

Gekoski:
So long as you believe, your decisions will justify all that you've striven, and won't ever sully your name.

Gekoski:
So go, Gravel.

Gravel:
No doubt about it... I already told him about my decision, and I even gave you a goodbye.

Gravel:
You oldies and your forgetfulness. I bet I fell out of your heads straight away, didn't I?

Bald Marcin:
Hah hah, I'm getting on in years for sure. Gets hard to remember so many things.

Gravel:
(...No. Marcin's reaction... something's odd about it.)

Gravel:
(Something so huge happened, and now he forgets it...?)

Runaway Girl:
Gravel Knight, the 'master of the house' you mention is...

Bald Marcin:
A name to know for sure. The Maypole family's Knight Primus Gekoski. He used to be a lynchpin of a campaign knight.

Bald Marcin:
The young Knights now'd have a shout in hell of investing what the Maypole family did, back in those days.

Brassrust Knight Fan:
*snort*. Don't forget, though, he's just old news now...

Gravel:
......

Brassrust Knight Fan:
For having offended your family and Knight Primus... I apologize, Knight.

Gravel:
Next time, there won't be a time for sorries.

Brassrust Knight Fan:
Uh... dgh. Boss, bill!

Runaway Girl:
Gravel Knight, is that Maypole family Knight someone... you really respect?

Gravel:
Mmhm, of course. It was with his blessing I didn't end up like the other 'chattel', stuck in the lowest of all work.

Gravel:
I could only become a Knight because of the training he gave me.

Runaway Girl:
How nice... having a chance to become a Knight. If... if I could be one too, then maybe I'd be able to return home and see my mom and dad again...

Gravel:
......

Gravel:
Have you been marked with a chattel serial number yet?

Runaway Girl:
I-I haven't... I got away midway through.

Gravel:
That was brave of you. Well done.

Runaway Girl:
Will it—make trouble for you helping me, Gravel Knight? I... I know hunters don't like being messed with...

Gravel:
Not to worry. Filthy business like this should've vanished long ago.

Gravel:
(No, more than that. In fact, it should've already completely vanished.)

Gravel:
(Let's just see for now...)

Gravel:
This bounty hunter won't dare try anything with you again, and you're not currently 'chattel.' No one will get in your way. Rush back home, hm?

Runaway Girl:
......

Gravel:
What's wrong?

Runaway Girl:
I... can't actually return, Miss Gravel.

Runaway Girl:
I have no money, and besides, I don't know where my home even is...

Gravel:
Isn't it right in Kazimierz? Just mention the village name, and...

Runaway Girl:
I-I'm not from here... when I was tiny, I was kidnapped and brought to a Kazimierz village.

Gravel:
......

Gekoski:
Go home? Alright, where do you call home? Of all of Kazimierz's villages, which is it?

Gravel:
It's... It's not...

Gekoski:
Hm?

Gravel:
...I'm... not from here.

Gekoski:
Then tell, young lady. Just where is it you come from?

Gravel:
...I... don't know.

Gravel:
I forgot everything.

Runaway Girl:
I—I wanted to escape, but I already forgot where I even came from...

Runaway Girl:
And then one day, a hunter told me he could take me to find a Knight, and they'd bring me home, and if I was lucky I could become a Knight myself.

Runaway Girl:
So I was... taken to Kawalerielki. I only learned afterwards that they were planning to sell me, and make me serve someone else.

Runaway Girl:
But that's not what I want to do! I want to go home! What I heard was he could take me to find a Knight, to take me home...

Bald Marcin:
Leaving Kazimierz by herself, finding her hometown and her parents, that's just asking far too much of a young kid.

Gravel:
Grr. I know.

Gravel:
(Of course I know. I couldn't be any clearer about this.)

Runaway Girl:
That thing on your arm... isn't it a 'barcode'?

Runaway Girl:
Surely that doesn't mean, you...?

Gravel:
Yes... it's true.

Gravel:
Unlike you, I never had even the chance to flee the hunters, and I got sold straight off. My one bit of luck is the old man who bought me was beyond charitable, without a doubt.

Bald Marcin:
Even so, becoming a Knight was all your own effort. From commoner to a campaign knight... anyone knows why that ain't an easy time.

Runaway Girl:
That's amazing. So you really can become one...

Runaway Girl:
After you became a Knight, did you ever return to your home to see your parents?

Runaway Girl:
I miss them so much. I want to see my mom and dad again...

Gravel:
......

Gravel:
I never found them.

Runaway Girl:
Huh?

Gravel:
I once went to a village, where you once happened to be. Maybe because I was searching for clues about those hunters, wanting to find out where they took me from.

Gravel:
But... I never found anything.

Gravel:
No. None of this is real.

Runaway Girl:
Gravel... Knight?

Gravel:
Don't drag me into the whirlpool of memories again. All this is... it's what I always, always feared happening most.

Gravel:
If I hadn't met the master of the house, if I hadn't become a Knight, if I'd never found my family... just what kind of state would I end up in?

Gravel:
But I've known, since long ago, that none of it will ever trouble my heart again.

Bald Marcin:
Gravel, what are you talking about?

Gravel:
And you, Marcin, you too. It could never miss you that I'd left Kazimierz, joined Rhodes Island... That's right, I came back from 'Rhodes Island.'

Gekoski:
I know... Can tell from a quick look in your eyes. You've come to say farewell to me.

Gravel:
I'm... going to Rhodes Island. To follow them.

Gekoski:
Hmph. Have you already told them your name?

Gravel:
Not yet. I need to confirm for myself once more, whether or not they're deceiving me, whether they want to use me for evil.

Gekoski:
Then go. To that Rhodes Island to see, and continue your hometown search as you do.

Gravel:
......

Gekoski:
I know... you haven't given up on finding it. It is the right thing to do, Gravel.

Gravel:
Father, I...

Gekoski:
Stop.

Gekoski:
It is just as we said those years ago, Gravel. Go. You were to leave sooner or later. As you are decisive in this moment, so there is little to long for.

Gekoski:
Come back to Kazimierz, should you want to come back. And should you not... then do not be burdened, and go!

Bald Marcin:
'Rhodes Island'? Gravel, you're a Maypole family vassal, a fourth-order knight...

Gravel:
All that is... the past now, Marcin. I belong to Rhodes Island now.

Bald Marcin:
You...

Gravel:
What this girl just told us, all of this is 'my' story.

Gravel:
I went unsaved by a Knight, was trafficked into Kazimierz, sold into Kawalerielki... and I didn't even know how to go about getting back home.

Runaway Girl:
But you got your own family in Kazimierz too. As a Maypole vassal, as a Knight, you must be so happy...

Gravel:
......

Gravel:
I am a vassal to the master of the house. I'll forever revere him, be grateful for him.

Gravel:
But, the last thing he said to me... is that I shouldn't forever long for this place.

Gravel:
I left Kazimierz. Because I had a reason to. And it was time to find my own true home and parents.

Gravel:
Yes... this is all just a dream.

Gravel:
And I know this, because there wouldn't ever be another child kidnapped into Kawalerielki.

Gravel:
Those ruthless scum dressing up in the skins of 'bounty hunters' were the last force in the trafficking business. As far back as I'd followed every village patrol and punished every hunter, they were already—

Gravel:
...Unf... ugh.

Gravel:
(This is... Rhodes Island?)

Gravel:
Yes, Doctor.

Gravel:
(So that really was just a dream.)

Gravel:
(I've been having similar dreams, one after another, but...)

Gravel:
Sorry, it looks like I... fell asleep.

Gravel:
Hehe, are you worried about me?

Gravel:
Funny. I'm usually the one watching you. I never imagined I'd be in another's gaze.

Gravel:
I understand. I know you don't get distracted at work. You're just supervising me, making sure I'm doing my job properly, aren't you?

Gravel:
Ah~. Anyway, don't let me weigh on you. Go on, continue with your work.

Gravel:
Hm? That'd be dereliction of duty, wouldn't it, Doctor~

Gravel:
You really are cunning, Doctor.

Gravel:
In Kazimierz, I'd hardly ever have the time to sleep. I'd dream so often... not that they were any good dreams.

Gravel:
Doctor, after losing your memory... have you ever felt helpless, or alarmed, maybe?

Gravel:
I do dream often. Of leaving my home, being brought to Kazimierz. I find all sorts of people to assist me, even my own dream 'me', hoping they can help me find my way home.

Gravel:
But the thing is, every time I'm asked where my hometown is, I just...

Gravel:
Even today, I still can't bring to mind where it is I came from. I only remember it was a place completely different from Kazimierz.

Gravel:
Poor, a backwater... fragile. The parents of mine who couldn't even protect their own child.

Gravel:
But no matter what, all these years and years, I've wanted always to find my home, to return and see my parents. I don't know if they're well, or if they'd still remember me.

Gravel:
How lucky of me, to be picked up by that old knight, to have a fate unlike the other 'chattel', to seize knighthood by my own efforts.

Gravel:
But, I've never forgotten... why it is I became a Knight.

Gravel:
The power to seek myself, the ability to protect others. And now, I have... protecting your life as my calling.

Gravel:
Aw~, are you embarrassed? It's alright, Doctor, I won't guess at what you're thinking. Right now, watching your every movement is the only function of these two eyes.

Gravel:
Just give me this chance, let me stay by your side to defend you, and that'll be fine.

Gravel:
Alright, you'd better head on back to work, Doctor~. Or perhaps, you wanted to learn about me, all especially?

Gravel:
It's alright, Doctor. I'll be keeping you company for a very long time. When the time comes and you want to know, I'll tell you all about my past.

Gravel:
I'm even freer than I was, leaving Kazimierz and coming to Rhodes Island, and it lets me keep searching for my home.

Gravel:
Right now... it's in quiet interactions, like these, where I can be most at peace.

Gravel:
Although...

Gravel:
(We're at the point where I can sleep in the Doctor's office... I suppose that's a little privilege of mine?)

Gravel:
(Oh, right, I should invite the Doctor to go back to Kazimierz with me sometime.)

Gravel:
(Heh-heh... It always feels sooo lonely in my dreams, back in Kazimierz all by myself. Aww, poor me.)

Gravel:
(Uh-oh, and here I have the spare time to think about this at work. Really... what a mess I am.)
