Shaw:

Skyfire:
You know, you can go apologize any time. Why do I have to go with you?

Skyfire:
Don't tell me you're shy. Please, I've had enough of your jokes.

Ifrit:
Huh? Apologize? Me? I... Ugh, this sucks. Anyway, that's not what's happening!

Skyfire:
Then let go of me. Stop pulling.

Ifrit:
No way! Dammit! If it wasn't for Silence and the Doctor's complaining, I wouldn't be wasting my time with all this.

Ifrit:
I was just trying to get a barbecue going. It wasn't supposed to turn out like that... Urgh, this is bullshit. The notes I borrowed from Ice Cube are all wet...

Skyfire:
So you are actually trying to study?

Ifrit:
W-What're you giggling for? I'm allowed to study! Besides, you were there setting everything on fire with me just the same. Why aren't they giving you an earful?!

Skyfire:
Don't you lump me in with you... That was an accident! I didn't think I'd lose control all of a sudden!

Ifrit:
Like I care—

Ifrit:
Hey, keep your voice down! There she is...!

Skyfire:
You keep YOUR voice down!

Shaw:

Skyfire:
You're a fine one to talk, Ifrit...

Shaw:
Eh? What? I'mhere!

Shaw:
Oh, it'sIfritandSkyfire. Sorry, Iwasjustthinkingaboutwork, soIwasn'tpayingattention.

Ifrit:
Hey, I'm telling you, stop...! Why are you running? There's no fire!

Shaw:
Huh? Oh, there'snofire?

Shaw:

Why did you assume there was a fire as soon as you saw us?!

Shaw:

Shaw:
Oh, I-I'msorry! That'snotwhatI'mtryingtosay!

Skyfire:
And just what are you trying to say?!

Ifrit:
How are you not done with this dumb back-and-forth yet?

Ifrit:
Hey, shorty. What are you up to? What's the rush?

Shaw:
Shorty?! MycodenameisShaw. Pleasecallme bymycodename!

Ifrit:
Okay, fine.

Ifrit:
So what are you doing? What's with all the papers? It's all packed with words... and why are these crossed out?

Shaw:
Oh, these? They'retheinspectionsheets foreachsection oftheship... EverythingIcrossedoff hasbeeninspected. Everything'sfinethere.

Ifrit:
Huh? You gotta check every last one of these places?

Shaw:
That'sright. Everylastone.

Ifrit:
Damn, sounds like such a pain. And you got so many of these forms.

Shaw:
Ofcourse! That'smyjob!

Skyfire:
You've got quite a few of these too. A tough job indeed.

Ifrit:
Ohh...

Ifrit:
Hey, what about this? What's this stack?

Shaw:
Hey! Stopit, don'tmessthatup! That'sa reportIgottagiveto ClosureandtheDoctor! Ihaven'tfinishedwritingityet...

Ifrit:
......

Ifrit:
Don't you get tired working like this every day?

Ifrit:
I couldn't stick with it. All the inspections, all the reports. That sounds so boring. Isn't there something... you know... cooler?

Ifrit:
Like, say... uh... I guess you look kinda cool when you use that fire extinguisher. Got me all wet last time, though.

Skyfire:
(That's a rather roundabout way to compliment someone... Don't tell me she believes this makes for an apology!)

Skyfire:
(It doesn't work at all!)

Shaw:
It'swork. It'snotsomething youshouldbeselfishabout!

Shaw:
Hm, but...

Shaw:
Personallyspeaking, IguessIcan'tblameyou forthinkingthisway.

Ifrit:
Right? Right?!

Shaw:

Ifrit:
Whoa! W-Why'd you raise your voice?!

Skyfire:

Shaw:

Wei Yenwu:
So you are the one responsible for this operation?

Shaw:
Y-Yes, sir... Chief!

Shaw:
U-Uhh, Imean... It'sanhonortomeetyou, Chief!

Wei Yenwu:
Relax. There is no need to be so tense.

Wei Yenwu:
It's all thanks to you and everyone else at the fire department that there were no causalities in this rescue operation. On behalf of all of Lungmen, please accept my thanks.

Wei Yenwu:
Is there anything you want for your reward? Money, an extended holiday? You deserve it.

Shaw:
Th-Thanksalot, Chief!

Shaw:
MayImakearequestformyreward?

Wei Yenwu:
Go ahead.

Shaw:
Iwouldliketoholdalarge-scale publicinformation campaignonfiresafety withtheL.G.D.!

Shaw:
Ibelieve furthereducationin firesafety canhelplower fireoccurrences aswellasinjuries, deaths, andpropertyloss! P-Pleasegivethissomethought!

Wei Yenwu:
Hmm...

Wei Yenwu:
Very well, I'll agree to this.

Shaw:
Really?! Awesome!

Wei Yenwu:
However, I also expect to see an acceptably feasible proposal for an information campaign of this scale.

Wei Yenwu:
And since you requested it, it falls on you to put together this proposal. If you want to see it happen soon, I'm afraid you won't be getting any of that vacation time for your reward.

Shaw:
Thankyou, Chief! Youcancountonme!

Wei Yenwu:
I took a quick glance at your file and work logs before our meeting.

Wei Yenwu:
Your performance in school was impeccable, and I'm confident you could find yourself a much better line of work, if you wished.

Wei Yenwu:
As for your current job, it seems you are unparalleled in the field. Your logs show that, up until today, you've been volunteering your own time to patrol on the weekends for the past two months?

Shaw:
Yes...

Wei Yenwu:
I have a question.

Shaw:
Ofcourse, Chief! Please, askaway!

Wei Yenwu:
Relax, this is nothing formal. If you would prefer not to answer, you have the right. This is just my own personal curiosity asking.

Wei Yenwu:
What drives you to go so far?

Shaw:
Thisis... well...

Shaw:
Ijustthinkthat... everythingthatIdo isworthdoing...

Wei Yenwu:
Can you bear with it and remain steadfast to your position?

Shaw:
Yes, Ican!

Shaw:
It'sexhaustingsometimes, but... Icandoit!

Wei Yenwu:
Very good...

Wei Yenwu:
Lungmen is lucky to have a young woman like you.

Wei Yenwu:
Now put your proposal together. I will arrange for a liaison to reach out. If you are going to do it, then give it your best effort... Do not come to regret your decision!

Shaw:
Of course!

Wei Yenwu:
I thank all of you, for all that you have done for Lungmen.

Shaw:
Mostofthetime, withtherightprecautions, firedanger canactually beavoided.

Shaw:
Aslongaswekeepup safetyinspections... andaslongas everyoneknows theirsafetypreceautions and whattolookoutfor, wecanactually keepfiredamage toaminimum!

Skyfire:
That's true. For example, never set up a charcoal barbecue grill indoors...

Ifrit:
Oh, shut up!

Shaw:
Neverbarbecueindoors!

Ifrit:
With these cans and stuff? Now that you mention it, I do see them all over the place.

Ifrit:
But if you're gonna put it like that, can't we just get Casters like MuMu to use their Arts to put the fire out? Why go through all the trouble?

Shaw:

Shaw:

Wow, hey... That's actually a pretty cool thing to say.

Shaw:
Hm? Whatwasthatjustnow?

Ifrit:
Nothing at all!

Ifrit:
If that's where your heart is, then you'd better do a good job! I'm going to that lecture tomorrow, and don't you dare disappoint me!

Shaw:
Y-Yeah...! I'lldomybest!

Ifrit:
But, hmm. Remember the podium last time? I couldn't even see you behind it!

Ifrit:
That's not gonna fly... Oh, I know! I'll ask Closure to do something about it!

Shaw:
Eh? But—

Shaw:
She'sgone...

Skyfire:
Don't worry about it. Just let her do her thing. Perhaps she'll actually figure out something nice.

Skyfire:
So how is your lecture coming along?

Shaw:
Imanagedtogetitwritten, butIjustdon'tthink it'sgoodenough... Everyonesaid theydidn'tknow whatIwastalkingabout lasttimetoo...

Skyfire:
Hmph, if they can't figure it out, it just goes to show the level they are at. That being said...

Skyfire:
Okay, let me take a look at your draft. I don't mind helping you with some minor edits.

Shaw:
Huh? Yousureaboutthat?

Skyfire:
I'm telling you I don't mind! It has absolutely nothing to do with me being sorry for setting the hallway on fire last time! Don'tyoudaregetthewrongidea!

Waai Fu:
—Watch out!

Waai Fu:
Hm? Say...

Shaw:
Sorry, it'sallmyfault! Iwasn'tpayingattention... Areyouhurt? DoIneedto takeyoutotheclinic?!

Waai Fu:
Oh... I'm fine. You don't need to apologize...

Waai Fu:
What about you... Are you with the Lungmen Fire Department?

Shaw:
Oh, yesIam! MycodenameatRhodesIsland isShaw!

Waai Fu:
I knew it! I got the right person...! I didn't expect to bump into you here!

Shaw:
Excuseme, butyouare...?

Waai Fu:
Please, don't be so polite. You can call me Waai Fu. I saw you on TV before.

Waai Fu:
I'm not sure if you remember, but it was that accident caused by the heater that's against regulations? I think it was a pretty big deal. Master Wei even took it upon himself to do some fire safety PSAs.

Shaw:
Oh, thatone...

Waai Fu:
One of my classmates was in that very building, and she kept telling me it's all thanks to you firefighters that everyone's still alive.

Waai Fu:
All of them are really thankful for everything you've done, and they've been paying extra care to the safety code. The city's awareness campaign was right after that... I learned so much because of that.

Shaw:
Hehe... That'sgreat!

Waai Fu:
I heard you led the rest of the firefighters at the forefront in that rescue operation. You really left an impression, with how cool and brave you were.

Shaw:
Oh, notatall. Y-You'regivingmetoomuchcredit.

Waai Fu:
Don't be so humble! That's just how amazing you are!

Waai Fu:
Oh, right... I forgot to mention. My classmate is looking to join the fire department, and she's prepping for the exam now.

Shaw:
Eh?! Ifsheneedsanything, letmeknow! Ihavesomematerials shecanborrow!

Waai Fu:
That's perfect! I know she's got to be studying so hard for her exam day after day. I bet she'll be so jealous if she finds out I met you here!

Shaw:
You'reexaggerating. Ihopeshepassestheexam!

Waai Fu:
Not at all. It's no exaggeration.

Waai Fu:
It may seem like no big deal, but she told me it was a miracle that everyone made it out alive and unharmed.

Waai Fu:
Shaw, you're a hero to her.
