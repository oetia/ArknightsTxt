Hawker A:
Come take a gander, feast your eyes on these fresh fruits and vegetables!

Hawker B:
Oi, old man, isn't that the lad from the Yek family? It's been a while since he's come by the market.

Hawker A:
What'd you expect? The boy's a guard for the Master's clan now. When would he have time to come here?

Matterhorn:
Ah, long time no see, Uncle. How have you been?

Hawker A:
Oh my, it really is you, Matterhorn. Heh, so what brings you around these parts today?

Matterhorn:
I've had some spare time lately, so I thought it would be nice to cook dinner for the Master.

Hawker B:
Good, good. Don't let your cooking skills go to waste. C'mere, go ahead and take this strip of steak. I remember the Master enjoyed them when he was young, and you'd always take a whole bag with you.

Matterhorn:
Thank you for your kindness, but let's get five pounds of tenderloin first.

Hawker A:
Oh, and the youngest was just a little girl at the time. Whenever you'd go shopping, she'd follow right behind you, tugging at the hem of your clothes.

Matterhorn:
Hahaha, Ensia was indeed quite small back then—also extremely curious, and she refused to stay indoors. She would make me bring her along.

Hawker B:
Here, the tenderloin's good to go. Hmm, the Master's tastes have changed, eh? Didn't he used to prefer short ribs?

Matterhorn:
Yes, the Master... grew up.

Hawker A:
Matterhorn, about the older sister... Oh no, I mean, excuse this addled old geezer. How has the Saintess been? All of us... miss her a lot.

Matterhorn:
The Saintess... has been in good health. Everything is well.

Hawker B:
Kjeragandr watches over her, so of course it is. You worry too much, old man.

Hawker B:
After all, the reason we can continue our humble little lives here is because the Saintess managed to stabilize the situation at a critical time.

Matterhorn:
She is as bright as the snow itself. If she was able to deal with that crisis so calmly, lesser problems would surely pose no issue to her.

Hawker A:
Good, good. Now all that's left is for her to be reunited with her siblings and old friends, and then we'll all live happily ever after. Hahaha!

Matterhorn:
(If only that were the case...)

Hawker A:
Ah, how much you've all grown in the blink of an eye. Time sure flies these days.

Hawker B:
Hardly. They've all grown up, but we've grown old. The young don't appreciate what they have.

Matterhorn:
Don't say that, you shine just as brightly now as ever before.

Hawker B:
Hahaha, spare me the flattery.

Matterhorn:
*sigh*...

Hawker B:
What's with that frown on your face? Something on your mind?

Matterhorn:
Auntie... After some thought, I think I'd like some short ribs after all.

Hawker B:
Alright, I'll have it right up.

Hawker B:
Here you go, is this enough?

Matterhorn:
That'll be fine, thank you. This is enough money, yes? I'll put it on the table here.

Hawker B:
Heh, you young folks sure can add things up fast.

Matterhorn:
Alright, you two. I need to start dinner preparations soon, so I'll be heading back now.

Hawker B:
Good, good. Don't let us old folks keep you any longer.

Hawker A:
Come visit us when you have the time!

Matterhorn:
*exhales*...

Cliffheart:
(Huh... It's Matterhorn. What's he standing there like a statue for?)

Cliffheart:
Matterhorn!

Matterhorn:
It's getting harder...

Cliffheart:
Matterhorn, what are you muttering about in the middle of the hallway with a plate in your hand?!

Matterhorn:
Oh, Lady Ensia!

Matterhorn:
Didn't you say you were going to go out to eat dinner with Aurora? You haven't left yet?

Cliffheart:
It's not anytime soon, so there's no rush.

Cliffheart:
Whoa, what a feast! Do we have guests over tonight?

Matterhorn:
Not quite. The Master finally has time to come home for dinner, and I wasn't doing anything else, so I decided to go ahead and prepare a few dishes for him.

Cliffheart:
That's a lot more than a few dishes. Let's see, let's see... Whoa, you even made my favorite braised pork!

Cliffheart:
I don't even want to eat out anymore. Maybe staying home and having dinner with my brother wouldn't be so bad...

Matterhorn:
Haha, then you're more than welcome to stay, Lady Ensia!

Matterhorn:
What else would you like? I can always make a couple more dishes.

Cliffheart:
Oh no, I'm good. You're already going overboard! This is more than enough.

Matterhorn:
Alright then. It'll be a few more minutes, so don't wait for me. I still have some stew on the stove, so I'll bring that over later.

Cliffheart:
Okay, I'll go wash my hands then!

Matterhorn:
Sure.

Matterhorn:
(If Ensia is here, then...)

Matterhorn:
(For now... How am I going to speak with the Master?)

Matterhorn:
Lady Ensia, I've brought the stew. First— Oh...

Courier:
Good evening, Matterhorn.

Matterhorn:
Weiss, why are you here? Is the Master not back yet?

Cliffheart:
Courier was just telling me that Enciodes is a bit busy, and probably won't make it back for dinner.

Courier:
I hope you don't feel too bad, Lady Ensia. Some things came up at the last minute.

Matterhorn:
I see... Then why don't we wait a little bit longer, just in case he can make it later?

Courier:
Matterhorn... Can I have a word with you?

Matterhorn:
Is this something you can't say in front of Lady Ensia?

Courier:
I was thinking, it's probably best not to wait for him... You know how the Master is, once he gets busy he'll spare no time for anything else.

Matterhorn:
Mhm. I know, Weiss.

Courier:
Matterhorn! Just a friendly word of advice, don't keep waiting...

Courier:
Maybe saying that he'd be late... was already his way of being considerate to you.

Matterhorn:
Weiss...

Courier:
For someone as thoughtful as you, a statement like that... should already have been clear enough.

Matterhorn:
Alright, I understand. By the way, I started smoking some jerky a few days ago. I'll go to the kitchen to pack some for you later. So you can take it with you as a snack.

Courier:
You... still haven't come to terms with reality yet.

Courier:
I appreciate your kindness, but my physician urged me to watch my diet because of a recent injury. And I thought I should take it to heart.

Matterhorn:
You're hurt, Weiss?! Where? What else did the physician say?

Courier:
It's just a little scratch. Nothing you need to worry about, my friend.

Matterhorn:
But why didn't you tell me? You're always hiding things from me these days. That's what has me worried the most.

Courier:
Haha, ever since I was little, you've always been worried sick about me whenever I got hurt. But now that we're all grown up, it's just embarrassing to keep putting that on you.

Matterhorn:
You're right... You can take care of yourself now.

Courier:
One more thing... It's about—

Matterhorn:
Hold on, Weiss.

Matterhorn:
(*Searches around in his pocket*)

Courier:
Are you looking for something?

Matterhorn:
Here, this is for you.

Courier:
These are... snowflake crisps?

Matterhorn:
I passed by the candy store this morning. When you were little, you'd beg me for these every single time you were hurt during training. I was afraid you'd ruin your teeth.

Matterhorn:
But look at you now, you don't even want my stuff anymore. Guess I haven't gotten used to it yet, haha.

Courier:
Matterhorn...

Courier:
(*Rips open the candy wrapper*)

Courier:
You have any free time later on? After I recover... let's go for a drink at the tavern.

Matterhorn:
Sounds good. Whenever you're up for it.

Courier:
Anyway, I'd better get going. See you later.

Cliffheart:
Uncle Matterhorn, what did Courier say to you? Will my brother make it back tonight?

Matterhorn:
Go ahead and eat first, Lady Ensia. The Master might not be back until quite late.

Cliffheart:
I see, figures...

Cliffheart:
Then you should join me at the table too. Food doesn't taste as good when you're eating alone.

Matterhorn:
Mm... Alright, Lady Ensia.

Matterhorn:
Let's have a bit of the stew first. The broth should be nice and rich from the bones.

Cliffheart:
*sips*— Whoa, what a rich taste. Your cooking skills are truly amazing.

Matterhorn:
Haha. You're welcome to try these charbroiled short ribs next.

Cliffheart:
Whoaaa, these are delicious!

Matterhorn:
There's no need to rush, Lady Ensia. Please be careful not to choke.

Cliffheart:
Huh? You should totally dig in too!

Matterhorn:
Haha, very well.

Matterhorn:
(Lady Ensia seems to have a great appetite today. I thought she hadn't been eating well recently because... Well, maybe I've been overthinking things.)

Cliffheart:
Whoa, those tendons came out so tender and chewy! Can I get another helping?

Matterhorn:
Sure. I'll get it for you.

Cliffheart:
I'll have another bowl of stew too. The meatballs are soaked in the flavor and taste super amazing.

Matterhorn:
Lady Ensia... You're still not full yet?

Cliffheart:
Not even close! Get me another bowl of mashed potatoes too!

Matterhorn:
You still have room for more? That's already your third bowl.

Matterhorn:
(She's eating way more food than she can handle...)

Cliffheart:
(*chewing*) Your cooking... ish way choo delishush!

Cliffheart:
(*struggles to swallow*)

Cliffheart:
(*covers mouth) Oh, crap!

Cliffheart:
*Hiccup*—!

Matterhorn:
Lady Ensia... If you're already full, it's fine to stop.

Cliffheart:
Y-yeah, maybe... I'm starting to feel a little full after all.

Cliffheart:
But, there's still so much left over... You spent so long making all this delicious food, I'd feel bad if it went to waste.

Matterhorn:
And I'd feel bad if your stomach exploded from overeating.

Cliffheart:
Uncle Matterhorn...

Matterhorn:
As long as you enjoy your meals with a smile on your face, that's enough for me.

Cliffheart:
But, but, if my brother was here, then we'd be able to finish.

Matterhorn:
Are you frustrated that he couldn't make it?

Cliffheart:
Well, yeah. We haven't sat down for a face-to-face dinner in forever! He always leaves in a rush in the morning and doesn't come home until late at night. I barely even get to see him.

Cliffheart:
Say, when I snuck up to see my sister and messed up his plans, that must've really made him mad, huh?

Matterhorn:
Lady Ensia... You didn't do anything wrong, and the Master... He wouldn't blame you for it either.

Cliffheart:
If only there'd come a day when our whole family could gather at one table to eat and talk and laugh, all in front of your delicious cooking...

Matterhorn:
Don't lose heart, milady...

Matterhorn:
I'll always be here for you. If there's anything you want to eat, I'll make it for you.

Matterhorn:
No matter... No matter what happens in the future.

Cliffheart:
Mm... Uncle Matterhorn...

Matterhorn:
It's getting late. You should get ready for bed soon.

Cliffheart:
Mhm. You too.

Matterhorn:
(*Tidies up the dishes left on the table*)

Matterhorn:
*exhales*... What should I do...

Matterhorn:
Master, you've returned.

SilverAsh:
Matterhorn, were you waiting for me this whole time?

SilverAsh:
I thought I sent Courier to convey that I wouldn't be able to make it back for dinner.

Matterhorn:
I kept worrying that you'd be too busy to eat, and what if you were hungry when you came back? So I decided to wait a bit longer.

SilverAsh:
Very well then. What do you have to eat?

Matterhorn:
Whatever you'd like, Sir. I'll make it for you right now.

SilverAsh:
No need. Just heat something up, and that'll suffice.

Matterhorn:
Surely... that won't do. I only have leftovers.

SilverAsh:
Hm? Did Ensia not go out to eat today?

Matterhorn:
When she heard that you'd be returning tonight, she decided to stay home.

SilverAsh:
I see. I'll try to get back a bit earlier tomorrow.

Matterhorn:
Understood. As for tonight...

SilverAsh:
It's fine. I don't mind if it's just Ensia's leftovers.

Matterhorn:
...If you say so, Sir.

SilverAsh:
Now go.

Matterhorn:
Sir, this is all that's left over from tonight's dinner.

SilverAsh:
What a feast. You must've worked hard to make all this, Matterhorn.

Matterhorn:
It is my job as your retainer.

SilverAsh:
What happened to your hand?

Matterhorn:
I cut it earlier, when I accidentally broke a plate.

SilverAsh:
Go apply some medicine to it. It'll heal sooner that way.

Matterhorn:
I'll be sure to do that, Sir.

SilverAsh:
Are these... charbroiled short ribs? I haven't had this dish in a long time.

Matterhorn:
Would you like some? I made them just like you used to love when you were younger. Nothing's changed at all.

As soon as those words left his lips, Matterhorn felt SilverAsh's eyes sweep across him back and forth. He suddenly panics, as if SilverAsh's torch-like gaze had penetrated through to what he had hidden within himself.

SilverAsh:
That's alright. I'll just have a bowl of stew.

Matterhorn:
...Right away, Sir.

SilverAsh:
(*takes a sip*) Very delicious. Your cooking is as spectacular as ever.

Matterhorn:
As long as it suits your tastes, Sir.

SilverAsh:
You even prepared some braised beastmeat, which has always been one of Ensia's favorites. No wonder there isn't much left.

Matterhorn:
Lady Ensia... waited for you a long time this afternoon. She has been very uneasy, wondering if you blamed her for what happened back then.

SilverAsh:
You've always paid particular attention to Ensia. But that's only natural, as she is the youngest of us.

Matterhorn:
Sir, I...

SilverAsh:
We can talk after I eat.

Inside the dining room, SilverAsh falls silent—only the soft sounds of chewing echo thorough the room. Matterhorn feels his throat twitch several times, but cannot produce even a single word.

Finally, SilverAsh sets down his cutlery and dabs the corners of his mouth with a napkin. Though his heart races, Matterhorn still lifts his head to look into SilverAsh's eyes.

SilverAsh:
How long have you been cooking this stew?

Matterhorn:
About a day.

SilverAsh:
A whole day. Only you have the patience to wait that long.

Matterhorn:
Sir, you exaggerate. These things cannot be rushed. Do so, and you will spoil its flavor.

SilverAsh:
What if you left it unattended over the flames and it boiled over?

Matterhorn:
If you simmer it carefully, it will not boil over.

SilverAsh:
True, but care alone is not enough to make the stew. When the time is right, you also have to snuff out the fire.

Matterhorn:
That is indeed true, Sir.

SilverAsh:
In other words, Matterhorn—

Matterhorn:
Sir?

SilverAsh:
Have you thought it over?

Matterhorn:
Sir... Indeed, I have.

SilverAsh:
Then... From now on, you no longer have to follow my orders.

Matterhorn:
...Do you want me to watch over Lady Ensia full-time?

SilverAsh:
Indeed, she needs your protection right now more than I do.

Matterhorn:
I am always ready to serve you at a moment's notice, should you need me.

SilverAsh:
No, that won't be necessary. Not only must you watch over her full-time, you must do so with your full devotion.

Matterhorn:
I shall respect your wishes without hesitation. But I do not understand...

Matterhorn:
Sir... When did you make this decision?

SilverAsh:
When did we first meet, Matterhorn?

Matterhorn:
When you were still a baby.

SilverAsh:
It's been that long, huh...

Matterhorn:
The Yek family has served the clan for generations, and this is my duty as protector of your house.

SilverAsh:
Protector... Enya and Ensia both see you as family, you know. Do you still insist on calling yourself that?

Matterhorn:
I wouldn't dare overstep my bounds.

SilverAsh:
There is nothing to fear. I am stating fact, not posing a question.

SilverAsh:
All sorts of problems have been pressing down on us since my return from Victoria. I can see that you've endured your share of difficulties as well.

Matterhorn:
I apologize for causing you worry, but...

Matterhorn:
But your relationship with Enya and Ensia...

SilverAsh:
Say no more. I feel much more at ease with you protecting the two of them.

Matterhorn:
Sir, your subordinate apologizes for being unable to help shoulder your burdens.

SilverAsh:
Matterhorn... no matter what happens, you must protect my sisters.

Matterhorn:
I will stand by their sides, even if it costs me my life.

SilverAsh:
I'll hold you to that.

SilverAsh:
But for now, leave me. I need to rest.

Matterhorn:
Yessir.

SilverAsh:
Matterhorn—

Matterhorn:
Did you need something?

SilverAsh:
No, it's just... Thank you, for all these years... For being here.

Matterhorn:
Master...

Matterhorn:
Please get some rest. You've been working too hard.
