Gummy has many memories.

Good ones, bad ones.

Happy ones, sad ones.

And ones she can't forget, no matter what.

Male Student:
They're in here!

Male Student:
Hurry up, don't let them get away... They have food!

Anna:
Lada, be careful!

Sonya:
Grrr, what a bunch of pests! Anna, Lada, stay behind me!

Sonya:
Heh, you lot've got some nerve. C'mere, and we'll see who has the guts!

Rosalind:
Dammit, it still hurts... Why are they here again? My arm hasn't fully healed yet.

Rosalind:
Hey, Sonya, why don't we have a little contest to see who can take down more gopniks?

Sonya:
Cut the bullshit... Watch out!

Natalya:
Come now, this is not the time to lose focus.

Natalya:
Our two generals have a job to do.

Anna:
Phew... That was a close one.

Anna:
Sonya, Rosalind, watch your back.

Sonya:
Thanks.

Rosalind:
If you have the stones to sneak up on me, I guess you're ready to meet your maker!

Female Student:
D-Don't panic, don't let them intimidate you. We have the numbers...

Male Student:
That's right, there's only a few of 'em! Don't give them the chance to call for help. If we all charge together, we'll be fine!

Sonya:
Hmph.

Natalya:
(Do you have a plan? It's true, they have us outnumbered.)

Anna:
(All we can do is think up a way to break out.)

Female Student:
I'm sorry, but... we don't have a choice. We need that food...

Female Student:
I don't want to starve... I don't want to starve to death in a place like this!

Male Student:
Don't give 'em a chance to escape! Block the door!

Male Student:
Get 'em!

Sonya:
*cough* *cough*... These bastards, there's no end to 'em!

Rosalind:
Don't tell me you're throwing in the towel already?

Rosalind:
Bah. Ugh, I think I lost a tooth.

Sonya:
You—

Natalya:
Wait, something isn't right about their numbers!

Anna:
Sonya, watch out!!

Sonya:
What?!

Male Student:
Hand the food over!!

Male Student:
Graaaaahhh!!

Male Student:
*cough*... Guh...

Male Student:
(*Falls to the ground, twitching*)

Anna:
...Lada?

Lada:
......

Lada:
Don't hurt Sonya.

Lada:
I won't let you...

Female Student:
Eek!

Female Student:
She's crazy!

Male Student:
She broke Andrey's neck! Be careful, everyone!

Lada:
I... I will protect everyone!

Lada:
Don't hurt my friends!!

Gummy has many memories.

Good ones, bad ones.

Happy ones, sad ones.

And ones she doesn't ever want to remember, no matter what.

Gummy has hurt other people.

Was it to protect her friends, or to not get hurt herself?

Gummy does not know.

But Gummy... Gummy doesn't want to hurt other people anymore.

......

???:
...my.

???:
Gummy?

???:
How did you fall asleep over here?

Istina:
Wake up, Gummy.

Gummy:
Ugh... Huh...?

Istina:
Wake up, Gummy.

Istina:
You're paler than a ghost. Are your wounds still bothering you?

Gummy:
I think I had a nightmare.

Gummy:
It doesn't hurt anymore, so don't worry. I'll be fine.

Istina:
That's good.

Istina:
......

Gummy:
Huh? Istina?

Gummy:
Why'd you stop talking? Are you about to leave? I can leave too. What about Zima and Leto?

Istina:
No, it's not time to leave yet. You rest some more.

Istina:
The others went ahead to scout out the way. They should be back soon.

Gummy:
Then, I'm gonna go help too!

Istina:
Not so fast.

Gummy:
Eh?

Istina:
One moment, Gummy. Don't start running around just yet.

Istina:
Your wound's not as light as you think it is. Hold still so I can apply another dose of medicine.

Gummy:
It really isn't that serious though.

Gummy:
Honest! I swear!

Gummy:
It just... kind of stings a little bit, that's all...

Istina:
Be a good girl, don't move.

Gummy:
Fine, if you say so!

Istina:
......

Istina:
You've taken a lot of hits.

Istina:
The scar from the previous injury seems to have gotten a bit lighter. I'm not sure if the wound this time is going to leave a mark.

Gummy:
I hope it doesn't.

Gummy:
The nice ladies from the Medical Department give me a super easy-to-use ointment. I rub it on every day, and the scars go right away!

Istina:
Sure enough. All the scars you've gotten this last year have been treated pretty well.

Istina:
But...

Gummy:
But?

Istina:
Gummy, when those bounty hunters attacked us earlier, you could've avoided getting injured, right?

Istina:
Why didn't you keep chasing after them?

Istina:
When you were about to knock them out, you hesitated and held back... That's dangerous, Gummy.

Gummy:
But, I...

Gummy:
I didn't have a choice.

Istina:
Gummy...

Istina:
Instructor Dur-nar asked me about your habit before.

Gummy:
The Instructor...

Istina:
You're afraid, aren't you?

Gummy:
...Mhm.

Gummy:
I'm very afraid.

Gummy:
The third time, I couldn't control myself...

Gummy:
I keep thinking back to that time at the school. I get nightmares about it. Even my night light doesn't help.

Istina:
I... I know. You toss and turn and have trouble sleeping.

Istina:
Both Zima and I know, but this is something you have to overcome by yourself, so we try not to say too much.

Gummy:
Mhm...

Istina:
But, Gummy, we're all worried about you.

Gummy:
......

Gummy:
I'm trying my hardest.

Istina:
Yes, I know. You are trying.

Istina:
You're the strongest one out of all of us.

Istina:
You don't need a night light to fall asleep anymore, right?

Istina:
Though you still sometimes come running to me and Zima.

Gummy:
Mhm...

Gummy:
I'll work hard to grow up and get over my bad habits.

Gummy:
I also asked Amiya and Dr. Kal'tsit. Dr. Kal'tsit said that Papa and Mama have very dangerous jobs, and it'll be really hard to see them.

Istina:
Do you want to go look for them?

Gummy:
I do. But I can't yet.

Gummy:
I don't want Papa and Mama to see me like this. I don't want them to think that I'm a bad girl.

Gummy:
So I can't yet.

Istina:
You're not a bad girl, Gummy. You're keeping us safe.

Gummy:
But, but––

Gummy:
I'm not good enough yet...

Gummy:
I can't control myself, and I hurt other people.

Gummy:
Istina, what should I do?

Istina:
You'll find a way.

Istina:
You might not be able to change things right away, but that's okay too. We'll here with you.

Istina:
We'll always be with you, so don't be afraid.

Gummy:
Istina...

Gummy:
Yeah! As long as you're with me, I have nothing to be afraid of!

Istina:
Alright, brave little bear, don't let yourself get hurt anymore!

Gummy:
Owwie, stop poking! Stop poking me, it hurts!

Istina:
So now you know it hurts?

Istina:
Alright, all done applying the medicine. Zima and the others should be back soon.

Istina:
Let's go check on them.

Gummy:
Okay!

Zima:
Have a nice rest?

Gummy:
I'm all better now, Zima!

Istina:
I treated her wounds, so they won't get in the way.

Istina:
How are things on your end?

Zima:
Getting some bad vibes from that village up ahead. It's too quiet.

Zima:
Might be another bounty hunter trap for all we know, so keep your guard up.

Rosa:
Our mission was originally to search for the missing children. My, what an unexpected turn of events.

Rosa:
How did we get all these bounty hunters after us?

Leto:
Huh? They were the ones who started it!

Leto:
Those bastards had two kids tied up! Weren't we looking for missing children?

Zima:
Well, whatever. We already got ourselves involved, so we can't just turn a blind eye now.

Zima:
They might've gotten away last time, but they won't get that lucky again.

Istina:
Just don't get too carried away. They aren't exactly easy to deal with.

Istina:
Plus, those children are their hostages. We can't get them too worked up.

Gummy:
If the bad guys show up again, I'll protect everyone!

Gummy:
Don't worry, I'm gonna send them packing!

Rosa:
But, what if they don't show up?

Gummy:
Um... Then, I'll flush them out?

Zima:
Pain in my ass.

Istina:
......

Istina:
I have an idea.

Gummy:
Hello—

Gummy:
Excuse me, is anyone home?

Gummy:
Hello—

Gummy:
Huh.

Gummy:
Guess not...

Zima:
Well, looks like we won't learn anything new here.

Zima:
Guess we should get going then.

Rosa:
So we're to return empty-handed? They will have to send some other operators out to try again.

Rosa:
Oh... But that means they'll be sending more experienced operators, right?

Leto:
Yeah, that's right!

Leto:
I heard that, err, whatsherface... Well, whatever, there's a super strong bounty hunter who can tear down entire buildings with her bare hands!

Istina:
*Sigh*...

Istina:
(Rosalind, you're a terrible actor...)

Leto:
(Hey, I was never good at this stuff!!)

Gummy:
Let's get going!

Gummy:
I'm sure the senior operators will be able to catch the bad guys!

Zima:
Huh?!

Zima:
(I hear something! Someone's coming!)

Istina:
Gummy, be careful!

Gummy:
Huff...

Gummy:
Hold it right there!

Quiet Bounty Hunter:
......

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
Don't poke your noses where they don't belong, little bears.

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
Or you'll regret it.

Leto:
Naw, we don't regret shit! Come try me on for size!

Zima:
Save it.

Zima:
Hey, lemme ask you a question. These all the guys you have with you?

Zima:
What'd you do with the villagers? And those two kids you abducted?

Quiet Bounty Hunter:
......

Quiet Bounty Hunter:
......

Quiet Bounty Hunter:
......

Zima:
......

Gummy:
(They're not talking.)

Istina:
I suppose we'll have to beat it out of them.

Leto:
Yo, that's what I like to hear!

Rosa:
It's certainly easy enough to talk big, but you do know this is different from a training simulation, right?

Gummy:
We've got this!

Gummy:
I'll protect everyone!

Gummy:
Ow!

Gummy:
Heavy! But I can still hold...!

Gummy:
Hyaaah!

Gummy:
Hah!

Gummy:
(*Slows down*)

Quiet Bounty Hunter:
––!

Gummy:
Ugh!

Istina:
Gummy!

Zima:
Gah, out of my way!

Quiet Bounty Hunter:
Urgh...

Leto:
Dammit, we were so close...

Leto:
We almost had that bastard!

Rosa:
Stay focused!

Bounty Hunter:
Ngh!

Gummy:
Istina! Stand behind me!

Gummy:
You won't get through me!

Istina:
Careful, Gummy!

Istina:
I'll slow them down...

Istina:
Now's your chance, Zima!

Zima:
On it!

Zima:
Piece o' cake.

Rosa:
My, such tough words from such a winded girl.

Gummy:
Zima!!

Gummy:
You're hurt! W-Was that because you took a hit for me just now?!

Gummy:
It's all my fault...

Zima:
Stop your blubbering already, it's annoying.

Leto:
Yeah, she obviously got way too careless! It had nothing to do with you, Gummy!

Istina:
......

Gummy:
But still!

Zima:
We've got more pressing issues on our hands right now.

Zima:
Hey, you! What's the play? You're the only one left.

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
......

Zima:
Spit it out. What happened to the village? And what'd you do with the kids?

Zima:
If you're not gonna talk...

Gummy:
If you're not gonna talk, then, we're gonna pull out all your hair and teeth!

Zima:
(Probably don't have to go that far.)

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
Heh. You're just a bunch of runts.

Leto:
Watch your damn mouth!

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
So you can deliver a beating or two. So what?

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
You wanna find those kids?

Gummy:
Sure do!

Gummy:
Out with it already!

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
Haha... dumb runt.

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
Too bad for you, I'm the only one who knows where those kids are.

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
Something happens to me and you'll never find them.

Istina:
You'll talk, if you know what's good for you.

Rosa:
In a situation like this, I would expect you to try negotiating with us.

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
......

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
Let us go.

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
Then we'll take those kids back to the village. As for the other stuff, you mind your own business.

Zima:
That's all you got?

Zima:
Sucks for you, but–– no deal.

Leto:
Why would we negotiate with a loser like you?

Gummy:
Yeah, yeah!

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
......

Gummy:
(He went quiet.)

Gummy:
(Is he gonna do that thing where you bite your tongue until you die?)

Istina:
(This is tricky, but we don't necessarily have to force it out of him...)

Zima:
Just smack him around a couple more times and we'll be good!

Gummy:
Ah, you're not supposed to raise your voice like that, Zima!

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
......

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
How dare you treat me like this...

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
––You damned runts!

Rosa:
Watch out!

Gummy:
Zima!!

Zima:
What?! Woah!

Zima:
You son of a bitch!

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
A bitch, huh?

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
Of course I'm gonna play every card in my hand!

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
Now die!

Istina:
Sonya!

Gummy:
–—

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
Damn you, little—!

Gummy:
......

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
*cough*... Guh...

Gummy:
I won't let you...

Gummy:
I won't let you hurt Sonya!

Gummy:
One more hit...!

Zima:
Wait, Gummy! I'm fine! Calm down!

Zima:
We still need to find out where the kids are!

Gummy:
––!

Gummy:
I, I––

Sullen Bounty Hunter:
......

Gummy:
......

Zima:
Gummy... Are you okay?

Gummy:
......

Leto:
Holy shit... Is he dead?

Rosa:
No, he's still alive.

Rosa:
......

Rosa:
My dear Rosalind, would you mind helping me carry this gentleman over there? I'm going to stop the bleeding, then help him 'wake up.'

Leto:
Sure thing... But why are you calling me that? It's freakin' me out.

Rosa:
Fine, fine. Come now.

Gummy:
Zima, your wound... There's blood! I, I'll help you bandage it!

Gummy:
I'm sorry...

Gummy:
I'm sorry, Zima, Istina. I... messed up again...

Zima:
Cut the crap.

Zima:
What'd you mess up? You saved me. I didn't even have a chance to thank you.

Gummy:
But...

Istina:
No buts.

Istina:
Gummy, you were scared, but you still protected us.

Zima:
Exactly.

Zima:
Besides... I know exactly how strong you are. If you really bashed his head in with all your strength, his brains would be splattered all over the ground.

Gummy:
But he––

Rosa:
He's fine. Don't worry.

Leto:
Actually, can't you smack him again to wake him up?

Gummy:
It's okay...

Gummy:
I, I kept things under control...

Zima:
You did.

Zima:
During that last swing, you managed to hold back your power. I saw it, clear as day.

Gummy:
......

Istina:
Gummy.

Istina:
Come here.

Istina:
You too, Zima.

Rosa:
You don't need us?

Leto:
What are you playing at?

Zima:
Settle down! Stop crowding around me!

Amidst the chaos, the children of the Ursus Student Self-Governing Group form an intimate gathering.

Istina takes Gummy's left hand, while Zima takes her right hand. The little bears hold hands, their foreheads touching. Nobody backs away even when their cheeks get itchy brushing against their friends' hair.

Gummy presses her head against her friends', their foreheads gently touching just as they always do when they play together.

And her friends press back against her intimately.

Istina:
Gummy, do you remember what I said before?

Istina:
You're doing great.

Istina:
Don't be afraid. We'll always be with you.

Leto:
That's right, you heard her! You did a great job, Gummy! That last block was great!

Rosa:
Hehe, you're almost stronger than a certain someone who can't control her temper.

Zima:
Huuuuh? You talkin' about me?!

Gummy:
Pfft...

Gummy:
Zima, don't start jumping around! Your wounds!

Gummy:
......

Gummy:
Have I...

Gummy:
Have I really done it? Did I really manage to control my strength?

Zima:
You did. You held back.

Istina:
I do think we'll be able to wake that fellow up pretty soon. Then we can ask where the children are.

Istina:
Trust me. I have ways of making him talk.

Istina:
Gummy, you not only protected us, but also those children.

Gummy:
I... kept things under control...

Gummy:
I did it!

Gummy:
I'll have to bring this along, and that... Oh, and some bread too!

Gummy:
Phew... I've finally finished packing my bag.

Gummy:
Papa, Mama, Lada is going to go find you two soon!

Gummy:
Even though Dr. Kal'tsit said it'll be hard, I still want to give it a try!

Gummy:
By the way, I don't have to hesitate when hitting people anymore... Because I know I'll be able to control my strength at the end!

Gummy:
I won't be a burden on my friends... and I won't be a burden on Papa and Mama.

Gummy:
Thanks to them, even though I still have nightmares, I'm not so scared anymore.

Gummy:
Papa, Mama, I'm having a great time here.

Gummy:
Oh, I have to go meet up with my friends now. This will be my first time going out on my own, but I'll definitely come back. I know they'll be waiting for me.

Gummy:
Phew.

Gummy:
Alright, I'll end the recording right there.

Gummy:
––Let's gooo!
