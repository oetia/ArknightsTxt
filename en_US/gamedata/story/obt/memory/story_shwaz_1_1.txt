Broadcast:
Attention, citizens and guests, do not be alarmed. The earthquake that occurred during the prior day's concert was an abnormal occurrence.

Broadcast:
A thorough analysis by Catastrophe Messenger Mr. Cronin has determined that such a thing will not happen again.

Broadcast:
Therefore, after careful consideration and consultation with the performers, the city has decided to reconvene the concert three days from today.

Broadcast:
At the same time, the city government will continue to closely monitor the situation surrounding the volcano. Please enjoy your visit.

Tourist A:
Whew, that was scary the other night.

Tourist B:
Was it really that bad? I was sleeping in the hotel and I just thought there was some fat guy playing jump rope upstairs.

Tourist A:
...I really don't know whether I should call that good luck or bad.

Tourist B:
But after something that big, I feel like there's still a lot of people out on the street. I'd think the whole town would've gone cold.

Tourist A:
A lot of folks did leave, but the city government cleaned things up pretty quickly, so not too many.

Tourist A:
After they stopped the concert, Mayor Herman came out to explain everything himself, and nothing else happened over the last couple days, so everyone's relaxed a lot.

Tourist B:
I'm glad. Siesta's so awesome, I want to stay at least a few more days.

Schwarz:
......

Bodyguard A:
You wanted to see me, Chief?

Schwarz:
I'm not the chief anymore, Charlie. Since the other day, you're Chief of the Public Security Bureau.

Charlie:
Huh? You finally found a sense of humor, Chief?

Schwarz:
I'm not joking.

Charlie:
You're dropping something that big on me right here?

Schwarz:
I've got a seat at the bureau, but there's nothing there for me. The Master will have someone send for me.

Schwarz:
It's enough to tell you.

Charlie:
Chief, don't. You've been away for a month at a time before. Why do you have to up and quit?

Schwarz:
It's different this time. I have to take Lady Ceylon far, far away, and I will not return for a long time. I've already sent your referral to the Master.

Charlie:
But to make me the chief...? I'm not up to that challenge.

Schwarz:
Of all the people in the bureau, half are useless morons, and the other half don't know how to adapt. You're the only one I can trust.

Charlie:
But I'm not nearly as tough as you, Chief.

Schwarz:
I've taught you enough to handle your typical gang of mercenaries.

Schwarz:
And for the stuff you can't handle... Over all those years with the Master, the only one that comes to mind is that one elderly gentleman.

Charlie:
Oh, yeah, that old guy was crazy tough.

Schwarz:
But he's an exception. You don't have to worry much. If anything happens, you come to me.

Charlie:
Well, it's not like I can say no anyway. I'll do what I can.

Schwarz:
You'll do more than that. If the Master comes to harm, I will come for you.

Charlie:
Chief, seriously, you really need to learn how to talk to people.

Schwarz:
I'm not interested in talking to people. We don't have to talk in this business, and you talk too much.

Charlie:
Oh.

Schwarz:
Goodbye.

Charlie:
Huh? That's it?

Schwarz:
That's it. The Master is still doing that interview in the TV tower. I've packed my bags, and I'm going to meet up with him shortly.

Charlie:
Oh, then I'll go with you, Chief.

Schwarz:
Why?

Charlie:
Well, you're about to head off, aren't you? Before you go, I'd like to learn another thing or two for you.

Charlie:
And since I'm your successor and all, I should probably go visit with Master Herman for a bit.

Schwarz:
......

Charlie:
Hey, wait up, Chief!

Broadcast:
Mayor Herman, is it true that your personal secretary, our dear Mr. Cronin, was seriously injured while surveying the volcano the day before yesterday?

Herman:
Yes. It's tragic, but he'll be in hospital for quite some time, I'm afraid.

Broadcast:
Oh. We're all very moved by the great sacrifice Mr. Cronin has made to protect Siesta.

Herman:
Indeed. I am most grateful for his dedication to Siesta over the years, and I ask all concerned citizens not to worry. We are treating him with the very best, state-of-the-art technology.

Broadcast:
We're sure Mr. Cronin will come back to us.

Broadcast:
Now then, it's time for a commercial break. Up next, we'll have some questions for Mayor Herman about the new city under construction.

Tourist A:
Who's Cronin?

Tourist B:
He's that one Catastrophe Messenger who was always on TV.

Tourist A:
Oh yeah. That good-looking guy who comes off kinda pretentious.

Tourist B:
That's the one. I never thought that much of him, but who would've expected him to give that much for Siesta. I had him all wrong.

Schwarz:
......

Charlie:
I mean, I know we locked Cronin up, but it feels kinda bad how we keep talking him up to the public.

Schwarz:
We don't want the people to panic.

Charlie:
Right, but you don't like it either, do you, Chief? I don't know exactly how it went down, but I heard he did you and the Lady dirty.

Schwarz:
You should know better than to believe rumors.

Charlie:
Sure, let's talk about something else. Where exactly are you going?

Schwarz:
I'm taking Lady Ceylon to work for Rhodes Island.

Charlie:
Oh, those real, live heroes. I heard the Lady was getting along well with them. Turns out she's already signed up.

Charlie:
Alright, I get it. The Lady's heading out to work, of course you have to go with her.

Charlie:
It's a pharmaceutical company, and I guess also secretly a mercenary outfit? I guess they'll have something for you to do.

Schwarz:
Maybe.

Charlie:
Can't believe it, I turn my head and the Lady's already out getting a job.

Schwarz:
Don't talk like you know her.

Charlie:
Hey, I've been in Siesta for five years. I was with the team that took the Lady to school in Victoria.

Schwarz:
Hmph.

Charlie:
But I really don't think she's changed all that much in the years since.

Schwarz:
True enough.

Charlie:
And neither have you, Chief.

Schwarz:
Really?

Charlie:
Really. For as long as we've been working for you, all of us feel like you're pretty much the same as you ever were.

Schwarz:
In what way?

Charlie:
Well... hmm, how should I put it?

Charlie:
The way you're so focused on the Master and Lady Ceylon, without any regard for yourself.

Charlie:
Our line of work is obviously all about the paymaster, yeah, but you're clearly not in this for the money. You've got a lot more heart in this game than any of us.

Schwarz:
I go to the seaside and sit on the beach, I wander around the music festivals, is that not enough self care?

Charlie:
It's your life, at the end of the day. Live it how you want. It's just, I've been watching you all these years and I can't believe someone could actually live like that.

Schwarz:
Live like what?

Charlie:
Promise me you won't kick my ass first.

Schwarz:
As if I'm so petty.

Charlie:
We get paid, and the Master's good enough to us. I wouldn't call it love from the bottom of his heart, but the affection's been there these past few years.

Charlie:
When me and the wife got married, the Master even showed up to say a few words. That made us big shots in the neighborhood, and the misses reminds me every day to work hard for the Master.

Charlie:
And me, I appreciate him too. So if you're gonna dump this on me, I'll grit my teeth and bear it.

Charlie:
But I can't say I'll give everything to the Master, Chief.

Charlie:
If maybe someday somebody threatened my family, I can't promise I'd side with him.

Schwarz:
I'm not asking that much of you.

Charlie:
I know, it's just an example. But honestly, Chief, that's only something you could ever do, because you don't have anyone else. All you've got to worry about in the world is Lady Ceylon and the Master.

Schwarz:
...They're my family.

Charlie:
No, they're not. You're not getting it.

Charlie:
What I mean is, setting aside the Master altogether, if it's my life and my wife's life on the line, I'd hesitate.

Charlie:
But you wouldn't.

Schwarz:
I wouldn't?

Charlie:
You wouldn't.

Schwarz:
......

Schwarz:
I'm afraid I wouldn't.

Charlie:
Right. As far as you're concerned, the only thing that matters is taking care of the Master and the Lady, it's the only thought in your mind.

Schwarz:
What goes on in my mind is none of your business.

Charlie:
Sure enough it isn't, and I'm in no position to say if that's right or wrong. I'm just talking here. You can tell me if my guess hit the mark or not.

Schwarz:
Maybe.

Secretary:
Mr. Mayor, you have Mr. House's banquet next...

Herman:
Bump it. Did you forget Ms. Eva's invitation? Prioritize.

Secretary:
Ah, o-of course.

Herman:
Hm?

Herman:
Schwarz, welcome.

Schwarz:
Master.

Charlie:
Master.

Herman:
Charlie, Schwarz has told me what good work you do.

Charlie:
Oh?

Herman:
By the way, please push my schedule thirty minutes.

Secretary:
What for, may I ask?

Herman:
I have to speak to the Chief Emeritus of my Public Security Bureau.

Secretary:
Th-This is... oh, I-I see.

Herman:
Schwarz, come.

Schwarz:
Oh?

Herman:
Charlie, since you're here, let's have you go work out some of the formalities with my secretary. He's good with these sorts of things.

Charlie:
Alright.

Schwarz:
Charlie.

Charlie:
What is it, Chief?

Schwarz:
Siesta's in your hands now.

Charlie:
...Right.

Herman:
Cronin had his rebellious streak, but he came in handy. This replacement is worse by a country mile.

Herman:
Good help is hard to find, Schwarz.

Schwarz:
With some training, he'll prove useful.

Herman:
Maybe.

Herman:
How old were you when you came to kill me? Do you still remember?

Schwarz:
Twelve-years-old, Master.

Herman:
Yes, right, twelve.

Herman:
A twelve-year-old assassin. Hah! If you didn't give up on your own, I'm afraid you really might've gotten me.

Schwarz:
As I've told you, the child assassin is not an uncommon tool.

Schwarz:
It's very effective at lowering the target's guard.

Herman:
I know all that. Thanks to you, I can spot a killer at a glance.

Herman:
Take that fellow over there in the swimsuit. The way he's looking every which way, wearing those sunglasses, he's a killer.

Schwarz:
He's untrained. And I think he's just scouting the women.

Herman:
Oh?

Schwarz:
I would say so.

Herman:
Looks like my kill-dar could use some calibration.

Schwarz:
You have me for that.

Herman:
But aren't you leaving?

Schwarz:
...Do you not want me to?

Herman:
Quite the opposite.

Herman:
Schwarz, there's a question that's been troubling me for years now.

Schwarz:
What is it?

Herman:
Your future.

Schwarz:
I don't think you need to worry about me at all.

Herman:
That's exactly why I'm worried.

Herman:
I often think of you as an extension of myself, like a third arm. There when I need, and no trouble at all when I don't.

Schwarz:
Charlie said something similar not too long ago.

Schwarz:
It's my choice, Master. And I think there's nothing wrong with it.

Schwarz:
You gave me this life, and even if you sent me away, I wouldn't leave.

Herman:
*Sigh*, what a stubborn girl you are.

Herman:
I watched you grow. The others may not understand you, but I know you truly do believe there's nothing wrong with that life.

Herman:
*Sigh*.

Herman:
I always thought of you as another daughter, Schwarz.

Schwarz:
Yes.

Herman:
When I talk to the movers and shakers of society, they always complain that even after all hope for their children, they're always disappointed when they don't follow the paths they've designed for them.

Herman:
And at times like this, I always think to myself: 'I'm so lucky. I have a daughter who, despite our strained relationship, is in all ways the spitting image of a wealthy young girl they speak of, and a daughter who I need not worry about in the slightest.'

Herman:
I have no such worries.

Schwarz:
And so you could comfortably turn your energies to the development of Siesta.

Herman:
Indeed. That's how I once thought.

Herman:
But I've grown tired, Schwarz.

Herman:
The new city is nearly complete, and the people will be able to move in as soon as the formalities are settled.

Herman:
I told that Rhodes Island Doctor that Siesta would not perish from the face of this world.

Herman:
But what I didn't tell the Doctor is that the Siesta in my heart is already long gone.

Herman:
The Siesta I promised to Barbara, the Siesta I built for her... I'm abandoning it, in the end.

Schwarz:
There's... nothing you could have done.

Herman:
No, that one would have had a way. That's a person who always has a way.

Herman:
After Barbara passed, I made the construction of this city my one goal. I did everything to achieve it.

Herman:
And now, for such a simple reason, I give it up.

Herman:
I can't accept it, Schwarz.

Schwarz:
Master...

Herman:
You know, there's been a thought plaguing my mind.

Herman:
The idea that if I can't do anything for this city, if I can only abandon it to its fate, then I should go down with it. That I wouldn't be able to live on anyway.

Herman:
So when the migration to the new city is complete, I will bring a chair out here, by myself, and sit on this beach, where I made my promise to Barbara. I'll face this sea, where I buried her.

Herman:
And that will be my end.

Schwarz:
No, Master. I won't let you.

Herman:
Haha, rest assured, if I'm telling you about it, it means I'm not actually going to do it.

Schwarz:
You can't... for the Lady's sake.

Herman:
That's where you're wrong.

Herman:
If there's another reason I can't die, it's you, Schwarz.

Schwarz:
The Lady doesn't hate you so much.

Herman:
It doesn't matter. All is well at this point.

Herman:
What's more, I don't worry much about the future of my girl Ceylon. I got lucky with that daughter. She'll have a good enough life. I give her what she wants, and that's enough.

Herman:
But you, I worry about you.

Herman:
Parents always want the best for their children.

Herman:
Only the most rotten old man would keep his children chained to his side, keeping them forever under his control.

Herman:
But me, I'd rather die while you're off living your own life with no time to visit me at all.

Schwarz:
My own life...

Herman:
And your life can't be Ceylon's life.

Herman:
That's not the way of the world, Schwarz.

Herman:
One can have a goal to strive for, but that goal can't be another person. I, as a father, don't want my daughter to suffer through that.

Herman:
Do you know why I had you go with Ceylon to that Rhodes Island company?

Schwarz:
Not to protect her?

Herman:
That was one reason, yes. But you've seen how capable they are.

Herman:
I spoke with their leader, and they won't have Ceylon doing anything that dangerous. More than sending you to look after her, I'm counting you to keep an eye on them, to make sure they don't do her wrong.

Herman:
The reason I'm sending you, and more importantly, the reason I'm exercising my authority as a parent...

Schwarz:
I don't understand.

Herman:
I am laying a path for you that you will not like.

Herman:
That is why I am sending you to Rhodes Island.

Herman:
They may welcome my daughter into their fold, but you are different, Schwarz.

Herman:
Do you know why?

Schwarz:
Because I am accompanying the Lady?

Herman:
Correct. No matter the company in question, they will always want someone willing to follow orders. But you? You have never served them.

Herman:
You will, of course, serve Ceylon first and foremost, obeying them only secondarily.

Herman:
This will be a source of some conflict.

Herman:
And knowing you, you'd rather resist them and continue to follow Ceylon.

Herman:
But that is not an option. I need you to solve this conflict.

Herman:
You are not a bodyguard accompanying Ceylon on her work.

Herman:
I've fired you.

Herman:
You are now my daughter, looking for a new job.

Herman:
I want you to go find your own life's work. Ceylon and myself can be involved, but your life's work can't BE Ceylon or myself.

Schwarz:
I...

Herman:
As for Ceylon, she's been living in Victoria, and judging from this past incident, she's learned to stand on her own two feet.

Herman:
But you haven't, Schwarz.

Herman:
On this point, you're quite different from her.

Herman:
You haven't really ever really left home to do your own thing.

Schwarz:
I did... to get revenge...

Herman:
That's your past. I'm talking about your future.

Herman:
So this time, you will truly leave home.

Herman:
Do you understand?

Schwarz:
But... can I come back?

Herman:
......

Schwarz:
Master, after I've killed those enemies, can I come back?

Herman:
......

Herman:
Of course you can.

Herman:
Hahaha! Come here, Schwarz!

Schwarz slowly approaches Herman, who places his hand on her head and rubs it intensely.

Herman:
While I could never be so cold-blooded as to refuse my own daughter entry into my home...

Herman:
If you don't take this seriously, I just might kill myself on this beach someday.

Schwarz:
You can't threaten me like that...

Herman:
But this truly is the one worry I still have weighing on my heart.

Schwarz:
I'll do what I can.

Herman:
You'll do more than that. If you fail, you won't be allowed back home.

Schwarz:
...Right.

Herman:
Alright is right.

Schwarz:
Just a moment.

Ceylon:
Hello, Schwarz, where are you?

Schwarz:
With the Master.

Ceylon:
If you're not too busy, could you help me move some things?

Ceylon:
I have too much luggage!

Schwarz:
Alright, I'll be there soon.

Herman:
Right. You go to Ceylon then.

Herman:
By the time you leave with Rhodes Island, I'll have gone to the new city. I won't be there to see you off.

Schwarz:
Okay.

Herman:
...Schwarz.

Schwarz:
Master?

Herman:
Live well.

Schwarz:
...Right.
