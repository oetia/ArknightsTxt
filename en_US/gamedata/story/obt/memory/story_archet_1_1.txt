We are here today to commemorate the past, and to welcome a new beginning.

All who stand with me today are my brothers and sisters. Fate has brought us together, and every bond that we formed is a gift given to us by the monastery.

We will not forget the bread and the beer, nor the bells and the fields. We will not forget the Law that we studied, nor the love that we shared.

We meet here today to bid farewell to Landen Monastery.

Hildegard:
Is there no other way?

Pious Cleric:
I understand your feelings, but the church has decided to close the monastery down at the end of the year.

Pious Cleric:
It can no longer support itself, and the church will no longer fund its operations.

Pious Cleric:
All we can do is bid it a respectful and dignified farewell.

Hildegard:
Can we not have a little more time? Everyone is doing their utmost to find a way to save the monastery.

Hildegard:
Maybe we'll find a way to improve our finances...

Pious Cleric:
I'm afraid the church has already given us more than enough time.

Hildegard:
But why does it have to be demolished?

Hildegard:
If we could at least keep the building...

Pious Cleric:
The monastery's land will have to be sold to repay its debts.

Pious Cleric:
While we'll always have fond memories of its fields and its sunshine, we should not prevent the land from realizing its value.

Hildegard:
Maybe I could have prevented this if only I'd worked harder...

Pious Cleric:
I regret this as much as you do, sister, but as the teachings say, we must learn to accept what we cannot change.

Pious Cleric:
May the beauty of days past live forever in our memories, and bless the future of our brothers and sisters—

Exusiai:
Now leave the demolition to me!

Hildegard:
Exusiai?!

Exusiai:
Obviously abandoned buildings should be disposed of, pronto.

Exusiai:
So if this monastery isn't doing its job anymore, there's only one thing left to do—blow it up spectacularly!

Hildegard:
What?!

Hildegard:
Wait a second! Even if it must be demolished, it should be done respectfully, not like this—

Exusiai:
Coming through, coming through!

Exusiai:
No time to talk! Let's send this centuries-old antique out with a bang!

Exusiai:
Three, two—

Archetto:
Wait!

Archetto:
Oh, thank goodness, it was just a dream...

Archetto:
I... I'm...

Archetto:
Oh right! There was a meet-and-greet session today... did I fall asleep on the job?!

Manager:
Don't worry, no one showed up in the half hour that you were dozing off.

Archetto:
I see, that's a relief...

Manager:
No it's not!

Manager:
We've been here since early morning, and we haven't sold a single album!

Manager:
There are long lines in front of every other artist's booth, too. This is pretty awful, even considering your current popularity... or lack thereof.

Archetto:
I'm sorry, I should have worked harder.

Manager:
Oh, I'm not saying you're lazy. I know how much effort you've put in.

Manager:
But it takes more than hard work to be an idol! You need relevancy and instant appeal!

Manager:
It's my fault too, for approving that nun gimmick of yours. Next time, we really ought to be more conscious of local appeal.

Archetto:
Gimmick? I was only being myself...

Archetto:
(And what purpose is there in being an idol, if I can't promote the monastery?)

Manager:
To be blunt, your career is at a crossroads.

Manager:
Today's meet-and-greet and album signing session is our last chance. If we can't sell these leftover albums, we might as well pack our bags.

Archetto:
I'm not sure what I can do at this point, but I'll give it my all!

Manager:
Look, someone's coming over!

Manager:
Get ready! This might be our first customer of the day!

Archetto:
Ahem...

Archetto:
(Recites without a hitch)

Archetto:
'The bells sing a song of love. We meet today, as ordained by beautiful fate.'

Archetto:
Welcome, and let us listen to the sounds of love and hope together!

Archetto:
Buy a copy of 'Sonata of Love's Bells' today, and get a free box of Landen Monastery's famous cystymilk bread!

Archetto:
(Makes a pose that is energetic but dignified)

Excited Fan:
Y-You're the famous—!

Excited Fan:
Oh, I'm so lucky! I never thought I'd see you here!

Archetto:
Thank you for the support. I wouldn't exactly call myself 'famous' though...

Excited Fan:
I hear you over the radio all the time, and I've bought a lot of your albums.

Excited Fan:
This is the first time I've seen you in person, but you're just as brilliant as I imagined you'd be!

Archetto:
(Is this what it's like to be popular? Deep breaths, deep breaths, look like an idol!)

Archetto:
(Sunny and elegant smile)

Archetto:
Thank you very much. Please continue to support my songs.

Archetto:
'Those who know to appreciate others are blessed with wisdom and kindness.' May good fortune be upon you.

Excited Fan:
Your voice is so sweet! Just like the way you sing!

Excited Fan:
I'm so excited I got to meet you today!

Excited Fan:
So can I get your autograph, Sora?

Confused Fan:
...Sora?

Manager:
You got the wrong person.

Manager:
The sign says 'Archetto,' not 'Sora.'

Perplexed Fan:
Archetto? Who's Archetto?

Manager:
Anyone else would've been furious at getting mistaken for another idol at their own meet-and-greet...

Manager:
But you even gave him bread?

Archetto:
'Do not resent a misunderstanding,' 'Do not be carried away by fame that does not belong to you,'...That's what the teachings say.

Archetto:
There's no reason to get angry at that gentleman over a simple mistake.

Manager:
Well, that's nice, but has it ever occurred to you that this is why you don't have any fans?

Archetto:
I thought it was because my singing and dancing weren't good enough.

Manager:
No, what you're lacking most is the ability to promote your character.

Manager:
Your gimmick is a nun, but you can't just 'be a nun' in front of the fans.

Manager:
You need to identify what fans love about the image of a nun, and refine, polish, and deliver on that.

Archetto:
But I only know how to be a cleric, not how to be an idol.

Archetto:
I understand that I'm promoting a business, but it always feels like I'm hiding my face behind that of another.

Manager:
The most important thing for a professional idol is to generate interest with your image and bring in revenue. That's what the advertisers are investing in, at least.

Manager:
Failing to maintain a consistent and appealing image will only hurt the sponsors.

Archetto:
Have I... ever done anything to hurt the sponsors?

Manager:
Advertising your monastery's cystymilk bread in a dessert parlor ad, bringing up beer on talk shows, getting caught on video catching a thief on the streets...

Manager:
Don't tell me you forgot all that?

Archetto:
While I understand now that a young idol shouldn't be talking about drinking... how exactly is catching a thief a bad thing?

Manager:
The facts notwithstanding, all the public saw was an idol getting into a street fight.

Manager:
And clarifying what happened isn't cheap either.

Manager:
Not to mention how the children's clothing brand was NOT happy with their brand ambassador getting into a fight, regardless of why.

Archetto:
They never mentioned that in the contract...

Archetto:
No, I apologize, it was my fault.

Manager:
I had high hopes for you, you know... I've always been confident in my eye for talent.

Manager:
Money aside, I was looking forward to seeing 'Archetto' shining brightly on stage.

Archetto:
I'm sorry... I wish I could have done more.

Manager:
Never mind that. Keep doing what you need to here. I'll ask around the other booths and see if we can get some tips.

Archetto:
What it means to be a professional idol...

Manager:
Excuse me!

Hildegard:
Er... yes?

Manager:
You seem to carry yourself well. Have you ever thought about becoming an idol?

Hildegard:
Er... an idol? What does that mean?

Manager:
You don't even know what an idol is?!

Manager:
Well... in short, it's about singing and dancing, becoming famous, and bringing hope and joy to people!

Hildegard:
(Singing? Dancing? I do regularly sing hymns, but I've never danced...)

Manager:
Just imagine! Standing on the big stage in beautiful costumes, thousands of eyes focused solely on you. The feeling of accomplishment—

Hildegard:
(Becoming famous? Could this be a chance to promote the monastery?)

Hildegard:
Would becoming an idol let me use my fame to advertise products?

Manager:
(Wow, this girl really gets it!)

Manager:
Of course! You're absolutely free to, once you're on the right track.

Hildegard:
Well, you've piqued my interest. Could you elaborate?

Manager:
Excellent! No time to waste. Let's find a place to sit down and go over the contract!

Archetto:
I thought I'd found an opportunity to promote the monastery, but I can't even fulfill the basic terms of the contract.

Archetto:
The teachings were right. 'Paths that look too smooth often lead you astray.'

Archetto:
Promoting the monastery isn't easy at all...

Archetto:
Oh, someone's coming.

Archetto:
'The bells of love welcome you, visitor from afar—'

Archetto:
Er... May I help you?

Old Lady:
Excuse me, I saw the sign next to the bread that says 'free giveaway'... So you're handing it out for free?

Archetto:
Er, yes, as part of the meet-and-greet...

Old Lady:
So I can get bread just for shaking hands with you?

Archetto:
Er...

Archetto:
(It's supposed to be for buying the albums, isn't it?)

Archetto:
(But this old woman looks...)

Archetto:
...It's alright. Go ahead and take one.

Old Lady:
Are you sure?

Archetto:
Of course! I'm just glad to be of help.

Archetto:
'May your honesty and kindness be repaid with peace and happiness in equal measure.'

Old Lady:
I haven't had anything this good in a month...

Old Lady:
Thank you so much. You're very kind.

The old lady grasps Archetto's hand firmly, as though to communicate her gratitude.

The touch of her rough skin is warm and sincere.

Archetto:
Thank you for your support. Have a beautiful day.

Archetto:
My first, er, fan?

Archetto:
Well, that takes us from zero to one. Keep at it; it's our last chance to revitalize the monastery!

Archetto:
H-Hello...

Innocent Girl:
Hello! Can I have some bread?

Archetto:
Bread...?

Innocent Girl:
Someone told me I could get free bread here!

Archetto:
Well... not exactly...

Archetto:
(But I can't make a child this small pay for it, can I?)

Archetto:
...Here you go. If you like it, tell your friends, too!

Archetto:
And thank you for the support. 'May the gospels watch over you, and grant you wisdom and health.'

Innocent Girl:
Thank you! Your voice is so sweet, and you're so pretty, just like those idols on TV!

Archetto:
'Just like those idols,' eh? Should I take that as a compliment?

Impoverished Young Man:
(Approaches quietly)

Archetto:
H-Hello!

Archetto:
'The voice of love is always here for you...' Would you like an autographed album?

Impoverished Young Man:
(Scratches head in embarrassment)

Archetto:
(This gentleman doesn't look like he has a lot of money to spare...)

Archetto:
Ahem... thank you for the support. Please, have some bread.

Impoverished Young Man:
(Takes the bread eagerly)

Impoverished Young Man:
(Leaves in satisfaction)

Archetto:
Thank you... have a beautiful day...

Archetto:
......

Archetto:
Should I move the sign advertising the album to a more prominent position?

Sora:
I'm back!

Sora:
They were handing out cystymilk bread in the old district!

Exusiai:
Are you serious?! Next you'll be telling me there's only one moon in the sky!

Sora:
It looked like charity work by the Lateran church? There were lots of people standing in line, almost like one of my concerts.

Sora:
The nun handing it out was really nice and pretty, and the bread tastes great too. Much better than those dessert parlors you see everywhere.

Exusiai:
Wow, you're right, it reminds me of home.

Sora:
Does the Lateran church often do things like this?

Exusiai:
Maybe, but they seem more likely to hand out dessert coupons.

Sora:
Say, I think I've seen the girl handing them out somewhere before... but where?

Tabloid Reporter:
Alright, I'm on scene, chief.

Tabloid Reporter:
Sheesh, what's the point of reporting on meet-and-greets by no-name idols? Any article I get out of this won't even pay for the taxi fare.

Tabloid Reporter:
Guess I'll just take a couple of photos and—hey, what's with that crowd?

Tabloid Reporter:
And at the head of the line is... the girl I caught on film beating someone up on the streets the other day?!

Rat King:
Well now, you don't see crowds like this in the slums every day.

Rat King:
I wonder if Tung would get as many people lined up if he handed out free finballs.

Eurill:
Never underestimate what a good promotional image can do for you. Not that I ever expected her to make it this big when I chose to work with her.

Rat King:
You've always had an eye for business partners. I suppose not all Laterans are like those crazy girls working for the penguin.

Eurill:
I've always placed high value on cultural exchange in business.

Eurill:
Of course, it's debatable whether taking a pure loss like she is counts as 'business.'

Rat King:
A bit of foreign culture in your life is never a bad thing.

Rat King:
Maybe you could talk to Wei, see if he'd approve the construction of a Lateran chapel in the slums?

Rat King:
Give those old folks a place to sit during the day, at any rate. All the better if there's more free bread.

Manager:
Archetto... what's with this line?! You didn't use Arts, did you?!

Archetto:
I'm not sure. I was acting as I always do... as a cleric.

Manager:
Wait, but why haven't you sold any albums yet?

Manager:
Oh, never mind that for now... come on, say your catchphrases while everyone's listening!

Archetto:
'We gather here today, brothers and sisters all.'

Archetto:
'We will all love each other, help each other...'

Archetto:
...Like that?

Manager:
That just makes it even weirder!

A long line forms in front of an unremarkable booth in a corner of this great city.

The setting sun paints the people's heads golden as a Liberi girl continues to give out bread to the people in line, to the tune of hymns arranged with drumbeat loops.

A peaceful scene, reminiscent of a mural in a cathedral.

Manager:
Are you sure you don't want to renew your contract?

Hildegard:
Yes, I have no regrets.

Manager:
Even though we didn't sell any albums last time, there's no question that it went viral on the web.

Manager:
'What a public personality <i>should</i> be like,' 'A true nun idol'... that's what they're calling you!

Manager:
You'll have access to so many more resources now if you stay.

Manager:
I'm sure you'd be shining on the big stage before long. Just like Sora!

Hildegard:
No... I've decided to step away.

Hildegard:
I've fulfilled my contract and promoted the monastery in Lungmen. It's time to look for other business partners.

Manager:
Well, I guess it's back to square one... What a shame; I thought I'd finally found someone who was going to make it big.

Hildegard:
I apologize, and thank you for everything you've done for me. But I have other things that I need to do.

Hildegard:
I've been away from Laterano for so long, but I've never forgotten my true goal: to spread the Lateran faith.

Hildegard:
Succeeding at business was never what I really wanted.

Hildegard:
And even if I must out of necessity, I'd rather be selling something more tangible, more concrete.

Manager:
That's very honest of you... Well, it's a pity, but I understand. Good luck.

Manager:
What are your plans, then?

Hildegard:
'Opportunity lies on the path that leads far into the distance.' We'll see.

Manager:
Well... before you leave, there's a concert being organized by Monster Siren Records, and the sponsor, MountainDash Logistics, has sent you a personal invitation.

Manager:
Even if you have to go, would you at least consider making a farewell appearance?

Hildegard:
Did you say Monster Siren Records? And MountainDash Logistics?!

Cheerful Cleric:
What's that you're looking at?

Solemn Cleric:
There was something else mixed in with the taped movies Fiammetta brought back.

Cheerful Cleric:
Is that Hildegard singing on stage?!

Solemn Cleric:
I never thought she had it in her.

Cheerful Cleric:
It's not so strange when you think about it. She's always had a beautiful singing voice. But this hymn has some interesting variations.

Solemn Cleric:
What do they call the people who do this, again? Idols?

Solemn Cleric?:
Maybe we could learn from it to help promote the monastery?

Cheerful Cleric:
What would we perform? Musicals based on religious stories? Choral performances?

Solemn Cleric?:
We'd need some foreign characters too, if we want to catch people's attention in Laterano.

Solemn Cleric?:
Say... what do you think of a joint performance by Kazimierzian knights and Iberian Inquisitors?
