Tick—tick—tick—tick—

Tick—tick—tick—tick—

Tick—tick—tick—tick—

Bang.

Lava:
Augh... shut up...

Lava:
Hibiscus, time to get up.

......

Lava:
You're not even gonna answer?

Lava:
No way you're thinking of lying in.

......

Lava:
You sent me a message yesterday saying you were making rounds or something. That I should wake you up in the morning.

Lava:
And here I am awake, and you're still sleeping. Haaah...

Lava:
Eh, sleep in all you want. I'm gonna go rinse up.

......

Lava:
Hm?

Lava:
Hibiscus, you're still sleeping?

Lava:
Wanna get up?

......

Lava:
I just got back from field work myself. The mission wasn't easy. A huge hassle, actually. Not many people other than me could deal with it.

Lava:
And Amiya gave me a hell of a lot of off days for it, so now I can sleep in for the whole day.

Lava:
If I wasn't getting you up, I could've gotten a lot more sleep. Haaah...

......

Lava:
Still asleep?

Lava:
Then I've got to do something or other.

Lava:
You said yourself last night, you were one of the Medical Department's elite at this point. You can't be late. I'll drag you out if I have to.

Lava:
Though saying that isn't a first for me...

Lava:
But having the chance to actually drag you out from your covers would be.

Lava:
Hm-hmmm. What in the world would you do without me?

Lava:
......

Lava:
Still not getting up? I'm seriously gonna pull 'em. If you catch a cold, don't blame me.

Lava:
Hibi—

Lava:
Hibiscus, what—what's up with you?!

Lava:
Why are your hands so hot?!

Hibiscus:
......

Lava:
Hibiscus? Sis? Don't kid me like this. Haven't you always been pretty healthy?

Lava:
Why would you just...

Lava:
Sis! Sis! Say something!

Hibiscus:
I'm awake... Lava...

Hibiscus:
Stop shaking me...

Lava:
Oh, s—sorry.

Lava:
Are you okay?

Hibiscus:
A little chilly... and weak...

Hibiscus:
Probably caught a fever...

Lava:
Fever? Your body can do that?

Lava:
Oh, right!

Lava:
Just wait for me a moment, I'll go and find a doctor for you right now!

Hibiscus:
It's no big deal... Lava, you don't need to...

Hibiscus:
Oh... honestly, you...

Ten minutes later...

Lava:
Hibiscus, I found a doctor for you!

Lava:
Ansel, you need to take a look quick! Is she alright?!

Ansel:
Wait, calm down—ack, stop pulling me like that—

Ansel:
Good grief... I thought you had something urgent you needed to drag me out for. I see it was your sister.

Hibiscus:
It's n... nothing...

Ansel:
The sick aren't qualified to say it's 'nothing.'

Ansel:
Hmm...

Ansel:
Do you have a thermometer in your dormitory?

Lava:
We—We do!

Hibiscus:
In our household medicine box...

Lava:
I'll go and get it!

Ansel:
Don't rush.

Hibiscus:
It's just... a fever...

Ansel:
Hrmm.

Ansel:
Temperature's a little high.

Ansel:
And you're unable to exert strength?

Hibiscus:
Mm-hm...

Medicine box! Come on! I remember it was here!

Ansel:
Have your diet and work-rest balance been fine these past few days?

Hibiscus:
Health...

Ansel:
Healthy meals.

Ansel:
Okay, forget I ever asked.

Ansel:
You and Folinic are both the type that don't call for worrying.

Hibiscus:
......

Ansel:
You've likely been too exhausted as of recent.

Found it!

Hibiscus:
Do the necessary... tests too... in a bit, please...

Hibiscus:
That way she can... feel a little calmer...

Ansel:
I understand.

Lava:
Here, the thermometer!

Ansel:
Please bring the whole chest over. I can administer Hibiscus all the fundamental tests that way.

Ansel:
A medical kit of hers should contain the necessary equipment.

Lava:
Got it!

Ansel:
With sufficient supporting data, I'll be able to discern whether her high temperature is a protective bodily response, or whether some other symptom has had knock-on complications.

Ansel:
We'll start with temperature. Here, open wide.

Ansel:
Aaah—

Lava:
H—How is she?

Ansel:
No great cause for worry. Her body is just self-regulating somewhat aggressively.

Ansel:
Overexhaustion should be the main cause.

Ansel:
As long as she rests up for the next few days, she'll be back again in no time.

Ansel:
She'll want a bit of a lighter diet, reduced salt and sugar intake, and to pay mind to balanced nutrition.

Lava:
So you're saying I've gotta make healthy meals for her...

Ansel:
The cafeteria can provide similar meals. You might not necessarily have to make them yourself.

Ansel:
As for other major points, Hibiscus knows more than well enough, so I won't go listing.

Ansel:
I'll file Hibiscus' sick leave for her at the Medical Department. Fang will tell the others.

Ansel:
The both of you shouldn't have any field work or missions lined up for the next couple of days, correct.

Lava:
I don't, no.

Hibiscus:
None...

Ansel:
Then there shouldn't be any problem.

Ansel:
If you don't have any particular questions, then I'll be on my way. I'll leave you to watch over her, Lava.

Lava:
Hey—

Lava:
......

Lava:
So I gotta look after you for a day or two, then.

Hibiscus:
Ah...

Lava:
I never took any sort of nursing class.

Hibiscus:
Lava... if you want to train... go train...

Hibiscus:
Your sister's... a doctor... she's not that weak...

Hibiscus:
She can look after... herself...

Hibiscus:
*Cough*, *cough* *cough*...

Lava:
That's enough out of you! Does your throat hurt? Do you need some water?

Hibiscus:
It's okay...

Lava:
Look, I, uh, I wasn't—I'm not saying I don't wanna look after you!

Lava:
It's just, that, I, I don't really have experience...

Lava:
So if I get any part wrong. If you're uncomfortable.

Lava:
Then tell me.

Hibiscus:
Lava...

Hibiscus:
Okay...

Lava:
Then we're doing this. You need to eat breakfast first. I'll go make some in a moment. I'll do the dishes after we're done.

Lava:
Is your appetite gonna be a problem?

Hibiscus:
It won't...

Lava:
Hmm...

Lava:
Want me to get a washbowl first, then, so you can wash your face and stuff?

Hibiscus:
(Nods)

Lava:
Just give me a moment.

Hibiscus:
(Pulls at a corner of Lava's hem)

Lava:
Oh. Is there anything else?

Hibiscus:
(Mouths a 'thank you')

Lava:
Nothing to thank me for. You got ill. I'm off for a couple days. It pretty much works out.

Uh, where'd that washbowl from before go?

......

Lava:
Phew... finally, all done...

Lava:
Jeez, nursing's rougher than I thought. I don't feel cool at all.

Lava:
If you asked me to do this in front of everyone else, I'd refuse point blank.

Hibiscus:
......

Lava:
Are you full?

Hibiscus:
(Nods)

Lava:
Then you can go back to sleep now.

Lava:
Close your eyes, and get some proper rest.

Lava:
I'll wash out the bowl, and then I'll go do the dishes, and then—not sure.

Lava:
Eh, anyhow, for now that's that. If you need anything, set the alarm on this clock to go off. I'll come right over when I hear it.

Lava:
Be good.

Lava:
(Pats Hibiscus's face)

Hibiscus:
......

Lava:
Mmnn... brush, washing-up liquid.

Lava:
(Did I give Hibiscus's face a pat just then?)

Mum and dad'll miss you.

Don't forget to write to us.

Be good.

Lava:
Hmph...

Lava:
(Mum and dad love treating us like that.)

Lava:
(Not sure if they've gotten the letter from last week yet.)

Lava:
(Mm... is that how Hibiscus treats me too?)

Hibiscus:
You need to eat healthy meals.

Hibiscus:
Be good.

Lava:
(Ugh...)

Lava:
(Whenever she acts like that, chances are she's trying to boss me around.)

Lava:
(......)

Lava:
(I don't know if that one bowl of meat porridge was enough to fill her.)

Lava:
(Should I peel her a piece of fruit too?)

Lava:
(Or maybe roast some meat?)

Lava:
(I really wanna set up a stove right by her bed and barbecue meat for myself.)

Lava:
(Make her starve drooling.)

Lava:
(......)

Lava:
(Let's go with peeling fruit, yeah...)

Lava:
I sliced some fruit for you. Do you want it?

Hibiscus:
Zzz...

Lava:
Sleeping pretty heavy, huh.

Lava:
......

Lava:
Weird, actually, how she doesn't look all that loathsome when she's asleep.

Lava:
(Pinches Hibiscus's face)

Hibiscus:
Zzz...

Lava:
Still running high.

Lava:
Hope she'll recover a little soon. That way I can prank her with a completely clean conscience.

Lava:
Haaah... I've been busy half the day. I'm a little tired myself now...

Lava:
Guess I can nap a little by her side...

Lava:
......

Lava:
Zzz...

Tick—tick—tick—tick—

Tick—tick—tick—tick—

Tick—tick—tick—tick—

Lava:
Huh?!

Tick—tick—tick—tick—

Bang.

Hibiscus:
Did that wake you up? Sorry...

Hibiscus:
It's the alarm I set for your porridge.

Lava:
I...

Hibiscus:
Do you want it right now, or in a bit?

Lava:
Now, I guess.

Lava:
Lemme get it.

Hibiscus:
Ah-ah-ah, don't get up. You knocked out all the way from yesterday to today and now you want to be up and about?

Hibiscus:
Lie—down—for—me.

Lava:
Weagh...

Lava:
(When did Hibiscus get this strong?)

Hibiscus:
I asked around a little. It was Pith who got you into this state after taking you out for special training.

Lava:
This isn't Miss Pith's fault.

Lava:
This was going to be a high-intensity training session, anyway. It might look pretty ruthless at first, but nothing ever starts smooth. I'll be fine after I'm used to it.

Hibiscus:
Still, you can't wreck yourself with training like this...

Lava:
I think it's worth it. I can feel how I'm getting stronger, Originium Arts precision or otherwise, training like this.

Lava:
Besides...

Hibiscus:
Besides?

Lava:
I was warned about this training, going into it. It'd be majorly intense, it'd be tough making it through and I'd need a good mentality and so on.

Lava:
I told the instructors: 'It's fine. My sister's a medic. Even if I end up half dead, as long as I still have breath in me, she'll bring me back.'

Hibiscus:
......

Lava:
More or less how it went. You get the idea.

Hibiscus:
Lava.

Lava:
What?

Hibiscus:
I'll overlook it this time, but if you end up like this after special training again, I'll officially raise dissent with the HR department.

Lava:
You don't need to—

Hibiscus:
I don't care what kind of improvement you might get out of this. It only matters to me whether this is going to damage your health.

Hibiscus:
No matter what, you can't...

Hibiscus:
......

Hibiscus:
I'm sorry...

Lava:
Hibiscus? Sis?

Lava:
Don't—don't cry. C'mon, look at how big you are.

Hibiscus:
Do you know how worried I was when I found you?!

Lava:
I'm alright, aren't I...?

Lava:
Just a little overdraft on my strength. And a few grazes.

Hibiscus:
No, not this...

Hibiscus:
Do you still remember... how you ended up at Rhodes Island...?

Lava:
That...

Lava:
I helped a bunch of merchants repel some bandits, and someone noticed I was an Infected...

Lava:
Then their caravan dumped me... and I remember someone or other bashed my head in. Then I passed out.

Lava:
And when I woke up again, I was aboard Rhodes Island.

Lava:
And somebody'd healed my injuries.

Lava:
I heard an operator in the field picked me up on the way back? Lucky thing I was only minorly injured. Wasn't much trouble for others.

Hibiscus:
They were heavy injuries...

Lava:
Huh?

Hibiscus:
I thought, after I lost touch with you, the next time we met, you'd still be the same awkward you, but...

Hibiscus:
Then you were on the operating table, Lava—burnt up like a fireball...

Hibiscus:
I couldn't... do anything to help...

Hibiscus:
The only thing I could do was—attend to you after the operation... just like now.

Hibiscus:
You were—crying my name, non-stop, in your bed...

Lava:
What? Wait, I never heard about this before...

Lava:
Then—Then why didn't you tell me—

Hibiscus:
Because I knew you'd act out if you got awkward! It was so tough just finding you. What if you just ran away again?

Hibiscus:
So before you recovered and officially came on board, I didn't even dare show up.

Hibiscus:
Ugh...

Lava:
I'm not—I'm not that unreasonable.

Hibiscus:
Of course you are!

Hibiscus:
You got lost when we left Victoria BECAUSE you were being so difficult, Lava!

Lava:
That—That was an accident...

Hibiscus:
In any case, you can't let anything like this happen again. Do you understand?

Lava:
(Quietly) Okay...

Hibiscus:
Mm-hm. There's a good girl.

Hibiscus:
Oh, that's right. What were you dreaming about?

Hibiscus:
If you don't mind, you're safe to share some of your dreams with your sister. It'll be good for your recuperation.

Lava:
Huh?

Hibiscus:
Mm-hm. I'm listening.

Lava:
I... I saw...

Hibiscus:
What did you see?

Lava:
I saw you...

Hibiscus:
Was there anything about me?

Lava:
You were...

Hibiscus:
Go on. I'm listening.

Hibiscus:
(Pats Lava's face)

Lava:
Hmuh?

Hibiscus:
Go on, then. What did you dream of?

Lava:
(I can't, this is too embarrassing! I can't say it!)

Lava:
Nothing!

Lava:
Nothing at all!

Hibiscus:
Be good.

Lava:
I won't!

Lava:
I didn't have a single dream!

Hibiscus:
How can you be so difficult right after waking up, Lava?

Hibiscus:
*Sigh*...

Hibiscus:
Being difficult isn't anything new. Why is your face so red, though?

Hibiscus:
Did you manage to get a fever too?

Lava:
Nope!

Hibiscus:
Just lie down now, and I'll take your temperature.

Lava:
What do you need my temperature for?

Lava:
Don't bring the thermometer over, I don't have a fever! It's nothing!

Hibiscus:
The sick aren't qualified to say it's 'nothing.'

Lava:
Can't you tell the difference between a fever and blushing?!

Hibiscus:
Why would I be making you blush?

Lava:
Be—Because it'd be so embarrassing having to tell you how you were so ill in my dream you couldn't even speak, duh!

Lava:
Uh.

Lava:
That's more... or less how it went...

Hibiscus:
Heheh. Hearing that actually makes me pretty happy.

Lava:
It's because usually... like, sis, you're...

Hibiscus:
I'd never be taken out that easily.

Hibiscus:
Mm, but it's always hard to expect the unexpected. So in future, I really might need you to look after me, Lava.

Hibiscus:
Of course, I've always believed you'll be there to help your sister out in bad times.

Hibiscus:
Even if you usually never listen and you're always so obstinate, you have plenty of ideas, and you're always fast to act.

Lava:
Is this just a really roundabout way of criticizing me...?

Hibiscus:
It isn't.

Lava:
*Sigh*...

Lava:
Fine.

Lava:
Do you have anything to eat? I'm a little hungry.

Hibiscus:
Yep, I do.

Hibiscus:
This is wonderful. It's not everyday we can get along so well.

Hibiscus:
Just wait a moment. I'll bring it over for you.

Lava:
......

Lava:
(So back then, she was there too, huh.)

Lava:
(I wondered why there was a voice that sounded so familiar.)

Lava:
(......)

Lava:
(If not for Mr. Johann teaching me, Hibiscus wouldn't have seen me again...)

Lava:
(I've got no idea how he's doing these days in Leithanien. Someone as talented at music as him probably got famous by now.)

Lava:
(Maybe a letter...)

Lava:
(I don't know when mum and dad'll send a reply...)

Lava:
(Everyone's... going through really rough times...)

Lava:
(If I could just be more powerful, then...)

Hibiscus:
Here we go, now. Here's some porridge, fresh off the flame. Eat it while it's hot.

Lava:
(Sniffs it)

Lava:
It doesn't really smell like anything. Isn't it meat porridge?

Hibiscus:
In your dreams, it was. This is cutting-edge healthy porridge. Healthy AND tasty!

Lava:
(Healthy?!)

Lava:
You—wait, hold on, did you put in that weird healthy powder or whatever it was you made?!

Hibiscus:
That's right. It'll be easier to absorb, and faster to deliver nutrients to your body.

Lava:
Let me just ask, first... have you tasted it yourself...?

Hibiscus:
Of course I have~

Hibiscus:
I eat three square meals a day, and my nutrition's especially well-balanced. That's why it's you who gets ill and not your sister, you know.

Hibiscus:
Here, try it. Healthiness is the most important thing.

Lava:
I don't wanna. I'm not gonna have a single spoonful.

Hibiscus:
I went to a lot of pains improving it. Just give it a try.

Lava:
Like I'm gonna trust you! You said you improved it last time, and it still wasn't—

Hibiscus:
Here!

Lava:
Wmmhphh!!!!!

Lava:
Mmph?

Lava:
......

Lava:
It's like it... tastes... kind of tolerable now?

Hibiscus:
Riiight~

Lava:
Mm...

Lava:
?!?

Lava:
Eugh, no.

Lava:
Nononono, what's up with this aftertaste?!

Lava:
Urp—don't tell me you just delayed the taste and called that better!

Hibiscus:
That's right. You can drink all the porridge in one gulp now, can't you?

Lava:
Hibiscus, we are NOT done!

Lava:
Bleuch...

Lava:
Mark my words! I am... eugh... NOT done with you!
